bedrocks next release comes from one of the ultra talented producers on the scene today - in 2003 the parisians invasion ep took people by storm with a refreshing new approach to sound and in turn put out one of bedrocks benchmark releases this two tracker picks up from where he left off and quickly reminds us exactly why the term inventive usually accompanies a yunus track let go rumbles from the very first beat with a concoction of subtly tweaked sounds together with distant melody that gradually works its way in creating a dreamy vibe the atmosphere is set with effected sounds and pensive melody while more percussive elements are layered ontop and takes it to the next level throughout the track a lush mood is constantly changing while at each turn the pace is lifted further with contrasting shades of deep and uplifting at the same time fever is on the flip side and is a more up-tempo mix of chunky bassline and grooving percussion that keeps us on our toes while a twinkley delayed sound entices us to listen further with the aid of a slight vocal cut a tribal flavour is added with percussive elements while unnoticed more vocally cuts and stabby synth sounds work their way in all the time oscillated synth sounds begin to twist the groove even more and by the breakdown an exalting melody has surfaced while a blend of down-tempo broken tweaked beats keep a flow before filtering back and rewarding brilliantly with a peaktime mix which right till the end continues to alter what makes this music special is the unique and at times magical sound thats created by guvenen who keeps clear of the tried and tested formulas of electronic music and looks to push the boundaries somewhat with an interesting structure to his tracks his music can be minimal at times big-room at times yet holding a powerful emotive flow along with detail in his music which continues right to the very last bar continually playing with the sound
miles whittaker and andy stott treat their millie andrea alias like a costume over their original run of singles from 2008 through 2010 they hid behind their masks to try out jungle garage and juke a tad less serious than most of their music the tracks were often illuminating ( you still got me ) but amidst renewed interest in stott solo and the ascent of whittakers demdike stare millie andrea fell to the wayside stage 2 marked their return in but the disappointing trap pastiche fell flat for the first time ever they sounded out of touch like they were trying to wrap their heads around what the kids like these days in its wake comes their first full-length together and one that sees them sounding comfortable and capable as if to remind us of the duos foresight includes two older tracks that sound remarkably current with their junglist tendencies and crunchy drums and sound very and they sit well with the lps six newer tunes all presented with the same worn facade everything sounds rough and scratchy like the rasp that coughs out of blown speakers that aesthetic that works best on the stellar which fashions rusty rhythms la fxhe into lashing breaks and mournful pads this pervasive bleakness has a numbing effect however and the duo rarely feel like theyre trying anything new murky techno of back sounds like stott by numbers sailing on a distant slowed-down sample only the albums bookends the symphonic decay of closer and the ponderous faucet-dripping beat of gif riff really bring anything to the table even the jungle blitzes feel standard by now when stott let an amen break rip in up box back in 2012 it was breathtaking and prescient when album centrepiece switches from grinding trap into brutal jungle its almost expected thats not to take away from which with its colliding rhythms and loop-de-loop synths is one of the records most memorable tracks but its dampened by a sense of complacency unbefitting of stott and whittaker which might be intentional you could think of those early millie andrea releases as fun little asides that didnt necessarily fit into stott and whittakers respective discographies but were good enough to release anyway if thats the case then follows suit: a solid diversion from two artists who we know can do better
ongos congos marimbas woodblocks and cowbells: producers seem infatuated with percussion these days in the world of dubstep and the first release from the mysterious producer with the everyday name is no exception taking cues from the emerging funky scene and producers like kode9 shackleton 2562 and ramadanman and are two different takes on a similar rhythmic palette is a low-key bubbler stuttering vocal samples drum rolls and eastern-sounding flutes are layered over gloomy synth pads and a lazy laidback bassline the rhythm ticks and clicks on almost as if racing against the slow and rolling pace of the bassline groove is slowly cooked up but it feels too drawn out to really grab you thats not the case on the b-side however is more energetic and lively reminiscent of the start-stop feel of an earlier release ramadanmans limey skittish drum workout contrasted by steady shakers and hi-hats it builds up a catchy groove that is no doubt extremely physical on a proper sound system reverberating chords reminiscent of the sombre jazz stylings of modus operandi -era photek provide a haunting sense of melody along with floating synths fter the second breakdown the mood changes and the tempo is picked up by lighter synth stabs and shuffling cymbals from a multitude of influences builds a distinctive sound with sparse melodic elements thrusting the rhythmic percussion into the forefront which in turn rests upon a backbone of bass this hessle release shows s promising talent; his music unlike his common and indistinctive artist name is quite unique
if i was placed in the middle of a dark club at 4 m trying to avoid the bumps and pushes of a packed dance floor desperately trying to enter my own little world then the reshuffle mix of s would be my ideal soundtrack its the most powerful production i have heard this year it has little resemblance to the original mix originally released by edrock in 2004 but its a perfect example of how sometimes all thats needed to create a great piece of music is a creative loop and clever sound design nd some of the sounds in this production namely the explosion of digital bubbles towards the end of the track are enough to put you in your own little world its certainly not suited to the bedroom the track needs a colosseum-style setting to make sense but thats exactly why john digweed signed it to edrock i cant help but feel sorry for the danton remix its like the unloved brother the one that gets picked on at school and spends a lot of his time on his face liking dirt much like that kid you know that this side of the record will be facing the same way a lot of the time its not a bad remix far from it nd im sure some will probably enjoy the extra element of groove that this remix delivers for many though it will simply be the bonus christmas present hidden behind the very big gift wrapped box delivered by reshuffle
is a little-known alias from cari lekebusch a veteran producer with a catalogue brimming with timeless tunes where much of lekebuschs best-loved work is straight up techno or house (spread across aliases such as mr james arth and phunkey rhythm doctor) is an outlet for more experimental electro-leaning fare there are slamming breakbeats vocoder vocals (a lekebusch trademark) and oddball samples which makes some tracks a quirky addition to dj sets the first release in more than ten years shows two of the projects sides the title track lands closest to s early sounds its a tense electro tune with a halftime rhythm sinister synth squiggles and a hammering bassline that creates a sense of brooding energy most djs will reach for the stoned lice a perfect cut for a partys early hours with dub techno stabs and crisp minimalist percussion its quick (132 pm) but its sparse bassline should get even trippier when pitched down
let s face it: breakbeat can be monotonous while house and techno producers are pushing 4/4 rhythms in new directions their breaks counterparts are still self-imposing limits on the aggressive posturing they do between the down- and the up-beat between the boom and the kat best artists know this and temper their distinctive sound with a diverse approach see evil nine whose breakspoll-winning you can be special too tackled everything from downtempo hip-hop to party bangers all with the attitude and aesthetic of a punk rock band baobinga i d know it too and use their debut album to pursue eclecticism at the expense of a clear identity generic catch-all title says it all after all isn t every breakbeat tune a big monster only thing that unites these tracks is their ability to test soundsystems and the sole ambition of their creators is to cover as much ground as possible geographically fat records manc hopefuls travel from baltimore to holland; generically they touch on everything from broken beat to emotional techno drawing from influences as disparate as carl craig and kyuss all the different styles are successfully executed but don t sit well together is rinsin booty bass the stanton warriors would be proud of and is a neat twist on the hardfloor template of loopy acid house but back to back they make no sense at all despite this lack of focus moments of hint at a fresh utterly unique sound tracks from 2006 of and (a highlight from the stantons fabriclive 30 ) are dark brooding progressive epics with dreamy atmospherics underpinned by growling synths and driving industrial rhythms y along with the equally moody intro outro and interlude suggest that the producers had in mind the kind of breaks record nine inch nails trent reznor would have made but suffered attacks of adhd along the way shame because if baobinga i d had kept their dark-ringed eyes on the emo prize they would have a debut to rival you can be special too or the plump djs eargasm while any attempt to expand the horizons of breakbeat should be applauded listening to gives no clues as to who the producers are possibly because they dont yet know themselves once baobinga and i d have developed their own identity they will be a force to reckon with watch this space
