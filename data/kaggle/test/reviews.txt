bedrocks next release comes from one of the ultra talented producers on the scene today - in 2003 the parisians invasion ep took people by storm with a refreshing new approach to sound and in turn put out one of bedrocks benchmark releases this two tracker picks up from where he left off and quickly reminds us exactly why the term inventive usually accompanies a yunus track let go rumbles from the very first beat with a concoction of subtly tweaked sounds together with distant melody that gradually works its way in creating a dreamy vibe the atmosphere is set with effected sounds and pensive melody while more percussive elements are layered ontop and takes it to the next level throughout the track a lush mood is constantly changing while at each turn the pace is lifted further with contrasting shades of deep and uplifting at the same time fever is on the flip side and is a more up-tempo mix of chunky bassline and grooving percussion that keeps us on our toes while a twinkley delayed sound entices us to listen further with the aid of a slight vocal cut a tribal flavour is added with percussive elements while unnoticed more vocally cuts and stabby synth sounds work their way in all the time oscillated synth sounds begin to twist the groove even more and by the breakdown an exalting melody has surfaced while a blend of down-tempo broken tweaked beats keep a flow before filtering back and rewarding brilliantly with a peaktime mix which right till the end continues to alter what makes this music special is the unique and at times magical sound thats created by guvenen who keeps clear of the tried and tested formulas of electronic music and looks to push the boundaries somewhat with an interesting structure to his tracks his music can be minimal at times big-room at times yet holding a powerful emotive flow along with detail in his music which continues right to the very last bar continually playing with the sound
miles whittaker and andy stott treat their millie andrea alias like a costume over their original run of singles from 2008 through 2010 they hid behind their masks to try out jungle garage and juke a tad less serious than most of their music the tracks were often illuminating ( you still got me ) but amidst renewed interest in stott solo and the ascent of whittakers demdike stare millie andrea fell to the wayside stage 2 marked their return in but the disappointing trap pastiche fell flat for the first time ever they sounded out of touch like they were trying to wrap their heads around what the kids like these days in its wake comes their first full-length together and one that sees them sounding comfortable and capable as if to remind us of the duos foresight includes two older tracks that sound remarkably current with their junglist tendencies and crunchy drums and sound very and they sit well with the lps six newer tunes all presented with the same worn facade everything sounds rough and scratchy like the rasp that coughs out of blown speakers that aesthetic that works best on the stellar which fashions rusty rhythms la fxhe into lashing breaks and mournful pads this pervasive bleakness has a numbing effect however and the duo rarely feel like theyre trying anything new murky techno of back sounds like stott by numbers sailing on a distant slowed-down sample only the albums bookends the symphonic decay of closer and the ponderous faucet-dripping beat of gif riff really bring anything to the table even the jungle blitzes feel standard by now when stott let an amen break rip in up box back in 2012 it was breathtaking and prescient when album centrepiece switches from grinding trap into brutal jungle its almost expected thats not to take away from which with its colliding rhythms and loop-de-loop synths is one of the records most memorable tracks but its dampened by a sense of complacency unbefitting of stott and whittaker which might be intentional you could think of those early millie andrea releases as fun little asides that didnt necessarily fit into stott and whittakers respective discographies but were good enough to release anyway if thats the case then follows suit: a solid diversion from two artists who we know can do better
ongos congos marimbas woodblocks and cowbells: producers seem infatuated with percussion these days in the world of dubstep and the first release from the mysterious producer with the everyday name is no exception taking cues from the emerging funky scene and producers like kode9 shackleton 2562 and ramadanman and are two different takes on a similar rhythmic palette is a low-key bubbler stuttering vocal samples drum rolls and eastern-sounding flutes are layered over gloomy synth pads and a lazy laidback bassline the rhythm ticks and clicks on almost as if racing against the slow and rolling pace of the bassline groove is slowly cooked up but it feels too drawn out to really grab you thats not the case on the b-side however is more energetic and lively reminiscent of the start-stop feel of an earlier release ramadanmans limey skittish drum workout contrasted by steady shakers and hi-hats it builds up a catchy groove that is no doubt extremely physical on a proper sound system reverberating chords reminiscent of the sombre jazz stylings of modus operandi -era photek provide a haunting sense of melody along with floating synths fter the second breakdown the mood changes and the tempo is picked up by lighter synth stabs and shuffling cymbals from a multitude of influences builds a distinctive sound with sparse melodic elements thrusting the rhythmic percussion into the forefront which in turn rests upon a backbone of bass this hessle release shows s promising talent; his music unlike his common and indistinctive artist name is quite unique
if i was placed in the middle of a dark club at 4 m trying to avoid the bumps and pushes of a packed dance floor desperately trying to enter my own little world then the reshuffle mix of s would be my ideal soundtrack its the most powerful production i have heard this year it has little resemblance to the original mix originally released by edrock in 2004 but its a perfect example of how sometimes all thats needed to create a great piece of music is a creative loop and clever sound design nd some of the sounds in this production namely the explosion of digital bubbles towards the end of the track are enough to put you in your own little world its certainly not suited to the bedroom the track needs a colosseum-style setting to make sense but thats exactly why john digweed signed it to edrock i cant help but feel sorry for the danton remix its like the unloved brother the one that gets picked on at school and spends a lot of his time on his face liking dirt much like that kid you know that this side of the record will be facing the same way a lot of the time its not a bad remix far from it nd im sure some will probably enjoy the extra element of groove that this remix delivers for many though it will simply be the bonus christmas present hidden behind the very big gift wrapped box delivered by reshuffle
is a little-known alias from cari lekebusch a veteran producer with a catalogue brimming with timeless tunes where much of lekebuschs best-loved work is straight up techno or house (spread across aliases such as mr james arth and phunkey rhythm doctor) is an outlet for more experimental electro-leaning fare there are slamming breakbeats vocoder vocals (a lekebusch trademark) and oddball samples which makes some tracks a quirky addition to dj sets the first release in more than ten years shows two of the projects sides the title track lands closest to s early sounds its a tense electro tune with a halftime rhythm sinister synth squiggles and a hammering bassline that creates a sense of brooding energy most djs will reach for the stoned lice a perfect cut for a partys early hours with dub techno stabs and crisp minimalist percussion its quick (132 pm) but its sparse bassline should get even trippier when pitched down
let s face it: breakbeat can be monotonous while house and techno producers are pushing 4/4 rhythms in new directions their breaks counterparts are still self-imposing limits on the aggressive posturing they do between the down- and the up-beat between the boom and the kat best artists know this and temper their distinctive sound with a diverse approach see evil nine whose breakspoll-winning you can be special too tackled everything from downtempo hip-hop to party bangers all with the attitude and aesthetic of a punk rock band baobinga i d know it too and use their debut album to pursue eclecticism at the expense of a clear identity generic catch-all title says it all after all isn t every breakbeat tune a big monster only thing that unites these tracks is their ability to test soundsystems and the sole ambition of their creators is to cover as much ground as possible geographically fat records manc hopefuls travel from baltimore to holland; generically they touch on everything from broken beat to emotional techno drawing from influences as disparate as carl craig and kyuss all the different styles are successfully executed but don t sit well together is rinsin booty bass the stanton warriors would be proud of and is a neat twist on the hardfloor template of loopy acid house but back to back they make no sense at all despite this lack of focus moments of hint at a fresh utterly unique sound tracks from 2006 of and (a highlight from the stantons fabriclive 30 ) are dark brooding progressive epics with dreamy atmospherics underpinned by growling synths and driving industrial rhythms y along with the equally moody intro outro and interlude suggest that the producers had in mind the kind of breaks record nine inch nails trent reznor would have made but suffered attacks of adhd along the way shame because if baobinga i d had kept their dark-ringed eyes on the emo prize they would have a debut to rival you can be special too or the plump djs eargasm while any attempt to expand the horizons of breakbeat should be applauded listening to gives no clues as to who the producers are possibly because they dont yet know themselves once baobinga and i d have developed their own identity they will be a force to reckon with watch this space

has name-checked the minimalist artist richard serra whose steel sculptures produce a sense of awe through their hulking cryptic presence on his last two albums 2015s transfer energy [feelings power] and last years outing as ceramic tl the adian producer has developed a sonic version of this effect his once club-related music has been stripped of decipherable content leaving vast grainy-surfaced structures that convey something immense and inarticulable the title of his new album might refer to this retreat into a closed aesthetic world but the music itself actually heads in the other direction yond is still unmistakably an album it uses the same harsh synthetic sounds and the same austere semi-rhythmic repetitions some tracks would sound at home on any of his records back to 2013s a/b l infinity (the four-note melody partway through couldve been lifted from that albums title track ) but this time around the arrangements are more mobile the repetitions more tightly knotted and the musics metallic surfaces dulled as if theyve rusted through exposure to the elements in its softer moments this new sound recalls the indie reinvention of s old night slugs colleague jam city ( has a synth pop history too as part of hiawatha ) on the title track a vocoded voice croons over a strangely pastoral arrangement the vocoder comes out again on where it accompanies a slouching almost rock-style backbeat v e p n one of the albums highlights ends with a gorgeous two-chord refrain a moment of fuzzy redemption not so far from jam citys dream a garden compounds the mood through judicious use of real-world sounds opens with the libidinous revving of high-powered car engines before jump-cutting kubrik-style into a dazzling cascade of synthetic sound the cars return later serving as a strangely emotive bookend to closer the last artist to use car engines in this way was e+e in 2013s weepy omega plate like e+es the light that you gave see you s latest brings an element of the human and the mundane into his epic depopulated landscapes his harsher records were more impressive but this one invites affection
it sounds like ricardo villalobos was in a party mood when he made the -side of his latest 12-inch: its among the fastest tunes hes produced close to 130 pm the villalobos rmx of eaver sheppards hovers in that magic tempo range home to timeless tracks like ny ideas que elle epoque and heike mood mix) years after release theyre some of the villalobos productions youre most likely to hear in a club the added pace gives the percussion extra spice a big reason why this -side is another bonafide party rocker its a shame most house djs will pitch it down the latest in a long line of villalobos vocal tracks the rmx lays a nasally refrain from the little-known canadian artist eaver sheppard over a rhythmic bassline and percussion that steadily builds in intensity villalobos has the golden touch when it comes to choosing vocals so sheppards whine like jorge gonzalezs goofy spanish on 2009s aile slots into the percussion wailing over the leaner passages while taking a back seat during the busier sections the rmx lands closer to the sludgy sound of villaloboss only other significant release of empirical house the bassline is muddy and the singing is more ethereal which creates a heady atmosphere theres a hint of classic house in the spoken vocal not heard in the -side buried in the mix which livens the mood when it takes centre stage alongside the sampled guitar in the second half if the rmx was the happy bomb this is the drift into space
takes its name from a mountain in southern france well-known for the intense climb it gives cyclists each tour de france nicknamed the beast of provence the legendary route is where yorkshire native james welsh aka attempted to break a cycling world record with four others as he puts it a lot of time was spent alone in pain in extreme heat in the dark with wild animals etc i had a lot of time to think about how i wanted this record to sound though it might not be a typical inspiration for electronic music (you know aside from one instance ) the conceit feeds welshs high-gloss techno some burly force bursts out the gate with momentum of a downhill race; the sharp skipping hi-hats in and set a mean pace for endurance riding but for all that forward thrust welsh is at his best when handling the musics unexpected curves setting the bike metaphors aside does great work with tightly wound rhythms gnarled acid tones and traces of bright synth melody (the title track is especially deft with its ricocheting chords and dizzy high-octave lead ) the sound makes welsh a perfect fit among s ranks alongside the likes of daniel avery and ghost culture but you could argue its too perfect: the growling bass of and s frantic pulse echo a few of drone logic s heaviest tunes and beatless cosmic closer canap the two most melodically interesting tracks here point to more distinctive ideas however and will hopefully set welsh on his own path
is the new label just launched by the dutch duo pako and frederik (global underground bedrock majestic) its first release comes from the pair going under their family names storm karkand on the a-side goes back to the chunky groovy and lush vibe that has been a little difficult to find in some record stores of late deep but fun solid but not hard standouts are the lovely warm bassline and integrated pad work - classically beautiful with tasty muted analogue blurts on the side essentially house this is a very accessible track for earlier hours or a mix cd and has enough energy (supplied by bass and addictive higher percussion) to get feet on the floor people go to a danny howells extended gig early for this kind of track complete nansensu on the flip is the progressive trance mover here starting off with a magical light synth pad that rises and falls along with slightly more intense electronic elements it has a very listenable intro but probably wont be heard unless a plucked echoed synth loop is used to match it - go on i dare you thereafter a kick that will get your neighbour calling the cops comes with a pulsing bass while a gated acid line and tons of perfectly layered synth work provide aural entertainment theres also some key changes and a breakdown thats just right for this kind of rushing electronic vibe - it has mystery but is not too long and keeps the energy well finishing off firing on all cylinders on this first release for illustrate they know how to produce quality sounds and arrangements and know what elements work well together storm karkand will just about fit in any house djs box whilst complete nansensu will find itself at the centre of many 3am peak progressive moments for sure great start to a new label
is a new label with a roster that in some respects feels like the brighter west london counterpart to the global explosion of east london inspired grime the beats are fast broken and heavy on sampled vocals but theyre also brighter favouring contours over jagged edges pastel over neon fter a wide ranging digital compilation earlier this year label boss begins vinyl releases with help from londons king of the effervescent r b cut up has long been a dark horse in the uks ever expanding club scene his tracks mostly edits are infectious and giddy their samples chopped with a ninja like mix of agility and precision the style makes his dj sets feel impossibly breathless on (based on 50 cents 21 ) the guitar sample loops back on itself perfectly the quick stabs sounding almost romantic on the flipside throws in another early 00s sounding r b cut up features more nimble chopping harnessing the energy of a strummed guitar these are simple loops but theyre done with an almost artisanal level of craftsmanship making them feel like more than the sum of their parts
you dont have to look far to find carbon copies of old dance music what so many artists forget when they borrow from bygone eras of garage grime hardcore or jungle is the sense of endless possibility and subversion that made the original stuff so exciting logos and mumdance together and seperately have done a remarkable job of tapping into that feeling their work is rooted in the past yet still fresh and modern taking classic tropes and brazenly throwing them into new configurations while the two have conjured up the ghosts of og grime in the past looks back even further than that homing in on a time in the early 90s when dance music was prone to rapid mutation if theres one difference between the music here and the music of yore its that feels unerringly mechanized you can hear it in the records bookends the portentous which beeps metronomically like a robot on patrol and a calm shoreline rendered in crude pixels theres an equally rigid approach to tension and release builds up and lets off steam with precision isolating a roaring bassline or ticking hi-hat and forcing each to thunder into the void alone just like their stylistic forbears logos and mumdance use rudimentary techniques to spice up their stark palette and sound as if theyre ripping through the fabric of time itself la early jungle while lets its drum sounds disintegrate and splinter with each new pass through the gauntlet its a crude time-stretching effect that sounds absolutely deadly the slight feeling of familiarity on is the records only flaw coming from the two guys responsible for mission and take time a direct glance to the past could come off as a compromise that said logos mumdance are also the duo behind in reverse a tune that sounded insane when it dropped in 013 and all because of the rather simple flourish of its backwards samples similar strokes of genius are all over a record that shows you dont always have to be flashy to be futuristic
originally issued on s snapshots ep in 1995 was a chord-filled techno homage with lush analogue bass the prolific rod modell and stephen hitchell have created five contemporary dub techno interpretations loosely based on the original track echospace one is best described as chilly over the course of 13 minutes layers of percussion and chords fade in and out while reverberation and filters are slowly tweaked the end result feels more mechanical than its source material though that doesnt necessarily make it less worthy of a dance floor s the music plays unbidden visions of time-lapse nighttime cityscapes spring to mind the deepchord remix begins with swirling digital snow the bass is thick yet indistinct double-time chords evoke inevitable memories of asic channel the mix grows dense then gradually elements fade leaving sleigh bell-like woodblocks next on the digital release are three bonus tracks starting with the harder shorter (at under ten minutes) echospace two congas and spacey treble synths play loosely over a simple three-note bassline the deepchord rebuild starts strong oddly shaped pulses move over a low heartbeat unfortunately it winds down gradually by its end all the best parts have disappeared the deepchord tmospheric rebuild is certainly the most original mix of the lot lien pitches alternate with a hum evoking gregorian chant modell and hitchell are dauntingly productive but experiments like this which are still surprisingly rare in techno music make following them worthwhile

the melodic emotionally driven house sound thats been so popular these past few years shows no signs of stopping at least for now dixon the styles most famous exponent was recently voted the 1 dj in the ra poll for a fourth time and last year the sound appeared frequently at the top of ras monthly top 50 which is generated by djs charting tracks the german artist butch doesnt exclusively produce these kinds of weepy dance floor moments but over the years hes shown a soft spot for them on he again links up with the musician and producer c vogt (among other bits they released a strong jazz-influenced single together called the infamous ) and for better or worse they capture the spirit of where so much house music is at these days butch is known for writing arresting grooves and he does so again here teems with percussion hand drums shakers what could be manipulated vinyl crackle and the overall effect is enveloping (a beat tool version of the track emphasises this ) c vogt a pianist and saxophonist naturally brings a sense of musicality to his work with butch and while he doesnt go for it in the way he did on the infamous theres a depth to the melodies that stands out the tracks dramatic breakdowns toy piano melody and indulgent string swells could together pose the question of where you stand on this style generally put another way its a moment where youd either leave the dance floor shaking your head or have your night taken to the next level butch and c vogts handling of these moods is pretty exemplary (the track was 1 on ras dj charts for december ) but like any music style with a single defined emotional quality its likely these expressions will eventually lose their potency
has been pc musics de facto dance floor correspondent since western beats even so if you told me last year that an artist from pc music was releasing an ep on turbo id have looked at you funny its an unlikely affiliation that came about through a remix competition west won wherein he remade an already silly tiga boyz noize track with a goofy bassline and cheap presets as with the stark simplicity of western beats however there was a certain charm to it enough to warrant a full ep on tigas label is both fun and frustrating the hallmarks of wests 100 remix are all here particularly the insistent squiggling basslines and the stiffly-programmed hand percussion (including what might in fact be too much cowbell) the recipe works best on a breezy track where the cowbell gets spun and delayed like its caught in a wind tunnel those little effects go a long way and theyre sadly missed on other tracks like the flat mad decent-isms of dont and its listlessly repeating vocal sample has a wonky lead that sounds like a kid going nuts with the pitch wheel on a casio keyboard and the wacky noise makes its drab backdrop somehow more underwhelming the title cut is almost as good as however and is a banner example of what made western beats interesting that freewheeling ep looms over which tries to fit into techno and house templates at the expense of the na ve charm that characterized wests earlier work
ewan smith is among the uks new wave of house producers though he prefers a more reserved sound than some of his garage-influenced peers the disarray ep on hypercolour from earlier this year found him in a reflective mood and his first ep for sees him withdrawing further inward the four-tracker is a particularly shadowy take on s usually lighter sound the result is luxurious and sexy even at its most languid smith exploits underground qualitys zoned-out aesthetic but does so with a giddy zip befitting of his homeland drops melismatic vocal cuts and ethereal keys on galloping drums that almost feel too rough for the delicate structure theyre supporting be meanwhile spruces up its cavernous abode with an organ melody that slides around the bend of every bar like its trying to outpace the beat need is simple blissful waves of melody riding a workmanlike beat but the way the sounds are filtered thinning out as if put through a sieve adds some detail starting out as the smoothest jam with its gentle bassline and softened string stabs unexpectedly drops a sharp hi-hat threatening to poke holes in the serenity below its this kind of contrast that raises smiths work above the fray of uk house producers
what would you do after recording an album like movements how would you top it would you even try after tracks as anthemic as mandarine girl and in white rooms anything less uplifting would seem like a come down so if you re not gonna top it what are the other options go faux fairy acoustic hey it s working for goldfrapp kind of or maybe you could try becoming the love child of leonard cohen and tom waits brinkmann does a pretty good job of it receiving the promo copy for s new ep this is what i was wondering: where would take their sound would they consolidate make a transition or try something radically new the cover suggested concessions to new rave (egad all those colours) but somehow i just couldn t imagine the duo abandoning their signature sound the result is something slightly less the the club mix of is carried by a melody heavily indebted to 80s synth pop like yello and telex hitched to a fun-loving and well-made tech-house structure with lots of dry ping-pong beats and a heaving synth-bass line ornamented with some squiggles and whistles it s nice enough but nothing special unsurprisingly the dub mix of presents more or less the same arrangement minus the melodic hooks it s a serviceable minimal track the pick of the three is the b-side the neon dub of one of the sonic features of the track is a looped hit that sounds a bit like the ring-pull on an aluminium can being plucked in fact this is really the only truly memorable thing about the whole ep don t get me wrong there s nothing to dislike about any of the material here it s just that after the last note fades there s just no compulsion to hit repeat and when you do revisit it well if you re me you ll just have this uncanny feeling of being underwhelmed again at least until you hear that enjoyable ring pull noise is this really the same production duo that made music as hyperdramatic and emotive as night falls or body language i guess the guys are trying to be subtle after the bombastic excesses of movements but when the overall effect is ever so slightly underwhelming you start wishing they d indulged themselves with a regression back into peaktime 2006 either that or taken up the ukulele
s conceptual precision on is admirable all tracks written and produced using only his mouth as a sound source its a pretty good hinge for an album and a good way to get critical attention even if the idea is cribbed more-or-less from herberts bodily functions (herberts evidently been listening too ajus now releasing via herberts accidental imprint ) these self-imposed limits can help hone an artists aesthetic necessity being the mother of invention and all that but an artist can also become a cropper for these restrictions play your cards wrong and youve got a record thats all talk and no backbone aju (aka san francisco based dj/producer marc barrite) has largely managed to avoid that outcome though there are a few moments here where youll wonder whether hes fighting a losing battle those particular tracks are mostly front-loaded on so dont give up if you find the circular characterless or the cringe-worthy lyrics on (which is otherwise a serviceable if unremarkable pass at the bumpty bump) frustrating if they test your patience as much as they did mine skip straight to in many ways ajus breakthrough moment its as thrilling now as it was when it started circulating earlier this year squeezing disco toms woodblock percussion and hissing hi-hats from his lips and tongue he builds a limber groove to frame a breathless vocal round its even better when remixed by luciano at the end of the cd: the pace increases ajus whispered asides are threaded into a series of urgent nervous tics a juddering riff cuts up the track like scissors through cellophane before a keyboard solo finishes up somewhere between maddeningly repetitive and gloriously aleatory elsewhere takes on broken beat others have rightly noted its close to reggaeton territory though the real thrill here is the morse code walkie-talkie melody that squeezes from the headphones about two minutes in plays out as a tribute to p p bradocks mix of iz dizs mouth from cheek-popping snares through slippery ballooning bass and pinprick chords its got the same compulsive bounce as bradocks mix and its attention to detail is lovely (watch out for the squelching slurps and swallows that pop up every now and then) on tracks like this works because while its concept is ultimately subservient to the overall composition you cant imagine these tracks functioning in quite the same manner or having the same impact without the particular tenor of ajus mouth-noise on tracks like and aju measures himself admirably and an album full of tracks of their quality would have gone down a treat but there are some stumbling blocks on here largely i suspect due to ajus desire to reach across genres to do disco do r b do broken beat and so on i think he might have got a little lost in that desire to canvas as many genres as possible its a good album at times genuinely diverting but would have benefited from more focus

while there once might have been shame in underground artists cuddling up to the mainstream the border between the two seems to be vanishing in not least with the advent of artists like disclosure s first single the -assisted vocal cut is a commercially viable slam-dunk in the vein of that young uk duo t works in the club sure but its appeal unmistakably lies with its chorus which has a way of getting stuck in your head for days on end the man behind this particular alchemy is will saul a uk producer whos using the name for his most unashamedly accessible music n a way it seems natural: hes just taking the already polished house of his labels simple and us and molding it into other shapes but its also a rather risky move for a world-renowned house dj despite what the infectious bounce of seems to imply is more of a downtempo record ts most memorable moments like the woozy synth spill of come from the way sounds reverberate around the wide-open sound stage reveling in their own splendour this is a lush record that sounds like it could have been recorded for a major label everything is engineered to be as smooth as humanly possible even the few beat-driven moments feel more concerned with lavish detail than dance floor impact is also predictably heavy on vocals offers smoky soul while features on the ballad the best vocal spot comes from rhythm sound veteran on the fantastic n which enrobes basic channel dub in sauls shiny oil slick here thundering slabs of low-end are replaced with dub sounds reverberating through an immaculate echo chamber softening sauls sound while also making it more powerful but that softening reveals s nagging issue: sauls new baby has little personality outside of its glossy production the problem manifests itself most with the burial pastiche where the done-to-death sound is inflated to theatrical scale losing any grit or impact that might have made it interesting in the first place s nice and welcoming as is itll never challenge you taking sounds youre already familiar with its a velveteen affair so utterly soft and pillowy that it can pass by without making much of a mark
when you get down to it whats the real difference between house and disco latest release from detroit underground hero andr s (also known as dj dez) and the debut of his new label openly flirts with both and comes out triumphant and universal in the process the is a sample-heavy groover based around a forceful but graceful drum loop as soulful vocals and strings emerge from vinyl crackle rickety but smooth all at once meanwhile lives up to its name with a roaming acoustic bassline that recalls the virtuosic work of someone like paul chambers as it darts around underneath a cool-blue rhodes melody ut its the title track which revs things up considerably that deserves the attention here slightly inescapable in so far and for good reason has a crunchy tape-worn groove that hobbles with a gravelly warble that brings to mind the same warm fuzzy feelings as vintage larry levan mixes suave keys only further drive it into territory that you might have found on salsoul in the late 70s instantly indelible part is the sterling strings however which swoop in flamboyantly swinging and swaying in full-on disco bliss skewed halfway between a bygone era and an ideal present and rendered with enviable ease is simply timeless no matter what you want to call it
is chosen to provide only the 2nd release on this newly formed sister label that is is first up and it is the pulsating electro baseline that really makes this track what it is nice crisp clapping hats also help to kick the track as well as the deep dubby baselines that drive the track subconsciously in the background not a bad track at all rhythmique on the flip for me has slightly more depth with a smooth baseline meeting some great melodic twirls and smooth cut up vocal snippets not as abrasive as the a-side and for me it s the highlight of this release not a bad release here on electric check out the b-side in particular

okay first a confession: i got into electronic music at psychedelic trance parties one minute i was like this music is bullshit and then someone gave me a little pill and an hour later i was all this is the fucking best music ever invented i didn t understand for a long while that trance was the runt of the dance litter i d talk to househeads at parties and try to convert them to sixteenth bass notes i d groove on the deep synth-ness of records rather than their rhythmic jump i d dance with my hands instead of my hips which is why the sound appeals now there s a kind of hypnotism in loooong held synth notes a respect for sustain tune and most importantly notes no matter how much the techno and house contingent would sniff at it it s a style that works people there is pleasure in notes and just because it s an effects knob doesn t mean tweaking it makes you innovative its a thousand year old fact but the harmonic scale makes dumbasses like me swoon which brings me to who s very young and swedish but has a way with a tune previous release on border six songs was a nice slice of nu-prog and is more of the same if a bit dirtier and messy as is the border tendency of late a-side is more than okay melding border bass programming with the new euro trance tendency (chardronnet landsky minilogue) maybe it s not 100 shake-your-ass but there s enough rhythmic momentum bounce and modulation to intrigue the lazy fat people on the dancefloor pity that it never reaches full steam after the breakdown djs would do well to mix this into something else with a little more kick because it s not going anywhere b-side untight is more to my taste: six minutes of continuous build knows the power of a shredded synth feeding the constituent parts inside each other so moment to moment we get a fine view of the beauty of each pity it s a bit rough and thick and raw but you do get the feeling that each section has been lovingly pored over it s not eight bars of this and then eight bars of that what i want for christmas is for producers to marry prog-trance builds with minimal techno attention to detail leave the rough to rock b2 is the beatless ambience of less exciting which is certainly well named but it feels like floating on a cloud and maybe that is enough sometimes all in all this is pretty swoonsome stuff from border i got over my psytrance hump but if hypnotic synths are going to be rehabilitated (and rest assured the techno snobs will dismiss this one just as day follows night) it s stuff like this which marries a respect for analogue tones with trance builds that s gonna do it
does classically-trained musician versatile dance floor producer experimental soundtrack composer simply want a hit that seems to be what suggests the lead single in anticipation of her soon-to-be released debut album making use of a simple progression built on solid bass and eponymous vocal repetition its a finely-weighted piece of deep house that will rescue more morose tracks in the mix with its delicacy and charisma it takes no risks but to do so would seem contrived tevo favours a jerky high-end approach and puts some echo on the vocals its a stripped-down break-infused percussion fest draped in analog warmth daze s interpretation provides the greater departure with a dense kick and murky production it offers a completely different dynamic to the other two mixes and is refreshingly dark theres definitely a clear sense of purpose in each of these mixes and they do serve to highlight different aspects of the compositions capabilities from the bordering-on-cocktail-bar-ambience and foot-tap tempo of the original through to the momentously driving remix by daze and tevo holding the middle ground with a version that encourages freestyle expression on the floor this is a solid release with soul
just when youd thought had crossed over onto the other side of house with his smash hit re-take of owner of a lonely heart from yes hes back to re-affirm exactly whats got people talking about him in the first place this tasty double a sider comes compliments of sander kleinenbergs little mountain recordings imprint the first track of which is automatic weapon it starts off in a fashion that has us hooked with a narcotic bunch of driving beats and filtery melodies that keep up the pressure while hypnotic vocals continuously add to the suspense the build is complete as were taken up and down and back up again on a euphoric trip does she know yet is just as sweet taking its time to unfold a mix of peaky beats and gentle melodies that begin to blossom as the track gathers pace before we know it the track is in full swing and the stabby synth riff has complete control over the flow taking it back down to the end is an artist who has risen quickly to become one of the leading lights of the uplifting house scene over the last few years and of late is creating a new awareness
now that we can hear s emergence series in its entirety it doesnt seem to chart an emerging style so much as a kind of decay from the punchy ruffneck hybrids of emergence 1 each instalment has become more sprawling its rhythmic grids stretching almost to breaking point the last of the trilogy was written in the canary islands with a batch of new gear and it sounds like the london producer was still getting to grips with it all the drums lack weight and some of the synth elements are a bit thin ut s music remains a fascinating abstraction of uk dance styles you wont find anything else quite like it oth tracks follow similar contours starting with a pulse-less scree of drums this gathers into a groove that would resemble uk garage if you plugged a few of its gaping holes fter a while chords enter and shoulder their way into the foreground for the breakdown before the duck-and-dive drums return to play us out is the stronger of the two thanks to a few touches reggae-style chords that ping across the stereo field odd reverb detonations triggered by the percussion lack doesnt work so well its quivering chords sap the momentum rather than build it and that fractured groove threatens to fall apart altogether
in a recent interview with ntss jon rust said she went through a creative dry spell last year not long after the release of her third ep universal glow on julio bashmores broadwalk records she put this down to her windowless and uninspiring former studio and also how she felt artistically in the aftermath of that record she gets her groove back on her latest outing a two-track ep on her own brstl label sounds like it was put together during a particularly bright spell of british weather it has a perky framework of rugged kicks cosmic synths and a rude bassline just before the two-minute mark wonderfully loud chords burst into view flooding the track with warm rays its such a simple record basic even but its unrefined feel is part of the charm on celeste turns her hand to techno almost everything about it is cleaner and more intricately interwoven from the kicks and hi-hats to the strip-lit pads and flute-like melody celeste says shes noticed that people tend to feel strongly about which of these two tracks they prefer but whichever way you swing both rank among her best work
s is billed as a blueprint for karma no kusari group-member kiki hitomis album from last year but in fact these are radically different records karma no kusari bridged jamaican reggae and japanese enka in whimsical doses melancholic pop and psychedelic dub conjuring a drifting sound world as strange and nomadic as the artist herself meanwhile is very much grounded in berlin specifically in the diy noise and art scene that s artists belong to along with hitomi those artists are dj die soon dj hotel and dead fader dj die soon is one the five founders behind the small but hard label and a producer noisy and rambunctious hip-hop check out his last lp for le petit mignon dead fader is also part the sbh clan though in recent years his music has moved toward swooning neo-classical dj hotels music mostly exists on bandcamp he favours a submerged ambient and techno style that breezes between the haunted and the dreamy documents those artists coming together with hitomi on the mic for a session in berlin in 2014 every track was improvised and recorded in a single take allegedly 44 them in total whittled down to these 13 the album moves like liquid a near-continuous flume sound burbling gushing and immersive hitomis voice rarely forming audible words is distant and swathed in reverb as though beamed into the room from far away her presence is more like an apparition gauzy and hovering over the entire record unlike the central role she plays on karma no kusari is the only obvious link between the two records its the sketchy precursor to walkers the second track f hitomis solo album as karma no kusari trained the spotlight on hitomi and her personal life pulls it back to expose the musical environment that shaped her: diy experimental and coarse by definition she is not the star though its a group effort and the din sound produced by dj die soon dead fader and dj hotel is compelling throughout you are coddled by it even when things turn spiky drawing from a well bass angst abstract machine song glitch and corroded hip-hop is a glinting diamond in the rough

defected squeeze a little more from their big summer anthem by releasing further remixes of a collaboration between bulgarians and kink opinion remains split about whether fcls remix of its you was genius or a case of the emperors new clothes ir mix of adopts similar techniques as that track most notably in its approach to bass for much of the remix they rely on tangerine dream-style arps to bolster rows emotive vocal and build the mood nd then in comes a booming bassline accompanied by ambient washes it would be tough to deny its effectiveness ben westbeech another producer with a summer smash under his belt takes a less subtle approach with his breach hat on his remix a tribute to robert perhaps dispenses with 99 9 of the vocal in favor of pummeling kicks military drums and a wild garagey bassline despite being the tracks co-writer and producer (as well as s significant other) kink still finds new ways to dress up the original he wraps a crushing breakbeat around a swollen techno rumble to prove theres plenty of juice in yet
as an artist and a person grew up fast he released his first 12-inch at the age of 16 and was quickly hailed as detroits next great house producer endorsed by local icons like theo parrish and omar-s by the time we profiled him in 2009 hed produced dozens of tracks launched his own label ( ) and was getting booked around the world a few years later hed already developed a wary view of the dance music culture he was now a part of in 2013 he released the boat party an album he says was about the appropriation of black music from a disenfranchised city juxtaposed with luxury european club culture and boat parties halls second album harks back to simpler times it collects eight recordings from before 2010 when he was still a teenager living at his dads place free to spend countless hours making tracks in the basement the house was on joy street in detroit but the joy in the title refers to more than that for me the idea of joy is an individuals experience of freedom hall recently told the fader for many it can be seen as a return to youth not having obligations gives you a certain weightlessness that allows for continued creativity clearly emanates from a mind at ease throughout the album theres not a grey cloud in the sky the melodies are soaring the rhythms upbeat the overall mood one of total optimism many of halls other records show him mutilating his influences into strange and almost unrecognizable sounds here he channels them more faithfully with clear echoes of funk jazz and soul adding to the carefree feel as usual with hall the compositions are raw in a way that makes you picture him banging them out on an mpc the parts hang together loosely but reliably like players in a band off-kilter loops form a shimmering backdrop for live improvisations mainly on rich pianos and buttery synths though hall says jazz wasnt a conscious influence on the record its rhythms have that rollicking flow on damn im stuttering kick drums follow tattoos of snare hits with the two parts never falling on the downbeats is a weightless swirl of strings piano and upright bass with hardly a kick drum to speak of most of the tracks ride swung house grooves but and are slower and more syncopated one of the albums more streamlined tracks has the delirious motion of someone rushing down a flight of stairs at face value is wall-to-wall good vibes but theres a streak of melancholy to it as well for hall these tracks capture a time and a state of mind thats gone forever the weightlessness of youth he felt before the pressures of adulthood bore down on him back then he couldnt have known that one day having made it as an artist hed long for those sessions in his fathers basement yet here he is trawling through recordings of his younger self enshrining them in this lovingly packaged lp as a house album is as bright and colorful as the painting on its cover but its also something bittersweet: an ode to an era gone too soon
s we heard on his excellent debut the story bout you s sound is warm romantic and inviting (just look at the title here) this new ep continues in that vein where spare 4/4 frameworks are established early on and the main focus of each track is essentially about how the resulting gaps are filled most often its with a roughshod collection of pinging toms sharpened claps and swirling pads though plenty of found sounds also lurk within the title track is aptly named for its modern lullaby overtones if you have young kids the soft edged and rippling chords which roll over more kinetic beats and hi-hats might be the perfect thing to send them off to sleep muffled sax and male voice also infuses the already fuzzy ambiance with yet more soulfulness while is the sound of playing outdoors on a hazy and lazy summer afternoon finally a again does that trick of pairing fairly firm well-defined drums and crisp percussion with more rolling and incidental melodies and streams of earthy hues
politics and electronic music didn t used to be such strange bedfellows in the nineties mille plateaux bolstered its empty clicks n cuts collections with post-structuralist deleuzzian drivel terre thaemlitz used his machines to explore gender politics and ekkehard ehlers released an album with the twin towers on the cover and politik in the title yet somewhere along the way these overt political statements largely disappeared especially in the dance community in favour of music produced purely for pleasure throughout his varied career matthew has explored various positions within these arguments from producing seemingly innocent house music to demagogic musique concr te diatribes his personal contract for the composition of music prohibits him from using pre-existent samples of any kind but that hasnt necessarily prevented him from releasing warm inviting dance music its when the politics overshadows the music that things become problematic; well-intentioned and admirable it may be but ultimately it s difficult to enjoy listening to is arguably s strongest fusion of political ambition with pop listenability to date rhythmically it slinks by with a lithe disco/house swing and with its reliance on brass and strings it owes much to the 1970s were in love padded with lush harp lines and syrupy strings wouldnt sound out of place on board the love boat and after a cinematic introduction just once moves to a chorus fit for the bee gees elsewhere things skip and stutter like matmos at their funkiest (harmonise) and the background is often buzzing with digital detail (723 objects were sampled including an raf bomber coffins petrol pumps meteorites and vomiting) but its the acoustic instruments which dominate both the movers and the shakers and moving like a train with the addition of s big band pound and swagger like prime stevie wonder or michael jackson like those artists its the voice that takes centre stage something has shown considerable skill with since his early house productions his partner dani siciliano takes the spotlight alongside dave okumu (jade fox sa-ra creative partners) and neil thomas and alone or in harmony they are frequently sublime opener something isnt right is immediately catchy beautiful and danceable but the albums highlight is birds of a feather a rich hybrid of electronics strings horns and sicilianos voice which is swoon-inducing thematically and lyrically is concerned with oil and the violence involved in its acquisition but these flew past me at first listen - all i caught were phrases which could just as easily appear on love ballads; however a line such as im on fire could here refer to something far more sinister than tearing up the dancefloor references to terrorism war and political impotence delivered so sumptuously make a complex proposition: an attempt at political subversion through both direct commentary and sheer delight and for those offended by s ideology its an album which can be easily enjoyed simply as a collection of satisfyingly clever pop songs

we strongly believe that music has the ability to change your state of mind and body reads part of the mission statement from ucharest record label true to their words the labels releases have been aimed at both the feet and head all dealing in the kind of ethereal and hypnotic textures that work best when looped and delicately manipulated zefzeed best known for his work on labels like ll inn and ody parts is the latest minimal producer to turn to brighter sounds after building his career with a dark and dubby palette offering as s fifth record the murky squelch of zefzeeds earlier records is still present on but now its bundled with a collage of simmering proto-house synths and pads that could be larry heard its a slow-burning warm-up cut and a handy one at that vlad ups the intensity on his remix making jack harder than most ten-minute tracks this stripped-down this 12-inch will appeal to anyone enjoying minimals recent embrace of brighter colours
when uk techno veteran dave clarke hooked up with mr jones to form a little over 18 months ago he hadnt set foot in the studio for more than six years nevertheless the duos first release together smacks of nothing but laboured experience made up of three versions of the same track the central template is a thundering groove with crisp kicks that cut through a coarse bassline on the warped synths meld with the mangled growls of us vocalist bear who whose repeated claims to be the rhythm rider command attention atop the pummelling framework although difficult to stomach at times its brutality is all part of the charm the instrumental mix leaves the tracks many elements to writhe and contort in greater clarity while the isolates the vox and the synths making for a potentially devastating tool
nhkkoyxe s dance classics material is streaked with colour as gleefully deranged as the indian holi festival the japanese producer real name kouhei matsunaga has roots in hip-hop and experimental music though these days he nourishes himself on a diet of techno in berlin his style is an accumulation of these influences with bouncy elements contrasted by darker shades matsunagas latest album for dance classics vol iii continues the trajectory set by the first two editions tracks like and playfully billow in his signature style the latter fills the bombastic techno-funk role filled by 112 off dance classics vol ii in addition to this are the crunchier textures of and an agitated ten-plus minute opus that starts prettily enough but then sporadically threatens to derail as bugs in the bassbin wreake havoc with the rhythm to the point where the track finally collapses onto itself this kind of rhythmic derailment is a central theme on dance classics vol iii its explored further on the captivating a track whose layers unfurl and reassemble its melody pockmarked with little blemishes then theres the almost comically aggressive which is like a more violent version of rroses 2011 epic waterfall here the eqing is unpredictable and erratic as if an agitated cat has been dropped on the mixing desk matsunaga seems hell-bent on fighting the established dos-and-donts of dance music i want to go outside from these limitations he said in a recent interview on ra he slaps his listener across the face just as their attention starts to fade its a fight hes winning: dance classics vol iii is at turns challenging difficult and strange but its never boring
greg patterson aka is a liverpool based producer who makes his debut for yo with their second release his first workings tricks was released on junior and with this follow up we can expect to see greater things from this producer respond with large support from digweed there is no doubting the effect this track would do in the clubs everything seems to be made with a powering and almost overwhelming nature strong hooks and riffs peak out and slide in with devastating effect while a vocal sample gets the twisted treatment the breakdown gets very nasty as some serious noise builds up then drops out leaving jaws dropped add to the mix an assortment of effects sounds and synths and you have one big ass club track what you want here we get a little dirty with low thumping basslines and aggressive hooks which compliment a seriously perfect melody think of an old tinny organ sound and that s what the melody consists of rolling synths assist in sweet breakdown goodness then drops in deeply with an almost haunting effect while the flip side track achieves hard controlled beats what you want floods the senses with an edged melodic house number
one of the three remixes on s stands apart from the others dva turns her tender into an eight-minute soundscape of pensive synths and samples taken from kim kardashians snapchat sounding somewhere between pop art and pan lanzas presence is reduced to a looped sample of her cooing just wanna impress you while clips of kardashian talking about makeup and yeezy shoes play out (along with the unsettling refrain dont think its working ) ts eerie and stimulating in equal measure picking up on the originals subtle insecurities and taking it somewhere completely unexpected the kind of remix that transcends the format to become something new the other two remixes are by lanzas previous collaborators morgan s take on doesnt have the same spark as their collaboration as the galleria but the skeletal framework puts underneath lanzas track highlights the nuance of her wonderful vocal performance s rework of however does have some magic to it the two footwork producers pad their usual attack to make it sound romantic like a fluttering heartbeat succeeds in showing its source material in a new light

theres something satisfying about this collaboration between and on the one hand you have the grime veteran and on the other one of the pioneers of its spiritual child uk funky their split 12 inch combines all the urgency of grime with the bounce of funky compromising neither along the way s solo track couples bit crushed synths with muscular kicks and incongruously synthesised birdcalls winding down with a sparkling melodic passage quite at odds with the preceding toughness s offering the quasi nostalgic bowsers opens with a sample of super mario winning coins this triumphant sound recurs as were immersed in a flurry of 8 bit melody and bone dry snares it works though you imagine the track would have double the impact at half the length most intriguing is the collaboration deranged bongos flurry alongside dancehall vocals and agitated kicks with raw unrelenting dynamism in contrast shares s hey vocal snippet but is otherwise subtler as barren as its name would suggest it plumps for the kind suspenseful tension and release explored on his dark crawler lp
its nice to hear florian in a contemplative mood not that this is uncommon for him many of his releases balance sheer power with patches of lightness but for the most part articula o his latest lp on is strangely soothing the album begins with a piece featuring text from iranian author and philosopher reza negarestani delivered hypnotically by vocalist joan la barbara over the course of 25 minutes metaphorical imagery is used to discuss notions of nature and culture: a forest and a city are divided by a deep gorge a nimble goat leaps between its inner walls a river with two streams in one flows between them and the sky is somehow everywhere at once takes a fairly literal approach running two opposing discourses in parallel nature in the left channel and culture in the right each touched by subtle uncomfortable warping and distortion the listeners brain constantly switches between the two channels and by extension the states described the text also returns in the records third and final track its treatment here is described in the release notes as the fine time structure of one voice sheathed in the amplitude envelope of another with colliding and reshaping the voices of sugata bose and anna kohler around and through each other the words are still audible but tangled in a highly agitated sonic mesh bridging these two pieces is the 29-minute ( meaningless affectless out of nothing ) placed between two movements with human presence its sprawling mixture of pokerfaced sonic events feels almost animalistic this meaningless affectless modulator is strangely charming even cute in places with moments of rhythm and sound design surprisingly reminiscent of club music neatly folding s most recent conceptual explorations in spoken word into an unpredictable self-referencing package articula o makes for a great listening experience but what makes it particularly striking is that this could be the most colourful and laid back has ever sounded
an all spanish release here from with frank garcia tony vega combining to create the as the name suggests expect some solid dark tribal drums to hit you quite hard in this release first up is the title track africaman starting out with some crisp drum patterns and a cut up vocal the track continues to flow nicely with a dark tribal set of drums and a deep subtle baseline that bubbles beneath the beats very chunky throughout a track like this really would need a big soundsystem to get the full benefits of the big sounds that emerge from this production following this is a technology accapella that features some vocal and drum loop effects first up on the flip is the original mix of technology again this production relies on deep dark tribal sounds as an intense set of drums work quite well with a subtle vocal effect as well as a booming baseline a dark stabbing synth enters the track giving it a grittier edge and making the production on a whole quite dark and dirty another solid outing here by the spanish duo following this is a remix of technology by production outfit afroboogie another pretty solid affair this remix again has quite a chunky tribal feel to it with a nice smooth baseline combining with solid drum patterns and a whole array of sound effects that combine quite nicely for tribal lovers this ep is certainly worth checking out and for those that love solid chunky music then i urge you to do the same there are some solid moments on here that are quite worthy of providing a good moment or two

self-confessed basshead londons v i v e k has worked harder than most to ensure the continued presence of deep and spacious dubstep in the capital on top of releasing a string of largely great eps through malas deep medi hes recently gone one better and built his own soundsystem in response to a lack of decent clubs in which to experience the full physical heft of his music his new system label is named after the club night where his rig resides and this first 12-inch offers suitably sub-loaded fare to match steroids is as vast and cosmic as its name suggests: theres precious little to it save a huge void carved out by a sub-bass drone so deep its practically inaudible on home speakers which leaves space for a few snare hits and percussive bleeps each drowned in reverb and leaving a trail of vapour coasting in its wake is a vocal version of the same track its female narrator drifting forward with eyes open wide through the heart of the gulf where a great deal of purist dubstep now feels frustratingly clean and lacking in the rawness of the genres early days steroid s pulsating subs are forceful enough to induce intense sensations of vertigo elevating it above the majority of v i v e ks contemporaries its easy to hear why he built a custom system to showcase this stuff on though without suitable amplification its a very sparse listen and lacks the immediacy of his earlier releases for deep medi om s remix of seems acutely aware of this he bolsters it with rolling cymbal tics and a springy triplet-led rhythm that appears to run both backwards and forwards at the same time a disorienting counterpart to the originals sensory immersion

the blurb accompanying s ep described it as a much-needed hot beef injection into a dance scene thats become a little too vegan-friendly for our liking i mention this not just because its the sort of over-the-top promo copy that brings a smile to an ra staffers face but because it struck me as straight-up wrong from the moment i started listening yes is a late 90s-era international deejay gigolos signee and the former duo (florian senfter now carries the torch solo) behind the 1999 megahit kernkraft 400 a beefy cv to be certain but as squelchy and grinding as the ep might get at times its commendably well-balanced not vegan exactly but senfter definitely managed to fit an asparagus spear or two on this platter its buzzsaw synths taking no prisoners the title cut comes heaviest but with an uncluttered arrangement built around bouncing organic drums its hardly the heaving mass it could have been melodically abstract and set to a strolling beat is almost confusingly well-behaved a little of that bottled-up tension seeps out on though until it explodes in its final minute or so we get only angry hisses a little overdriven disco sneaks into the interlude-like paving the way for zoo brazils downright nerdy remix sure isnt exactly a light meal but its not likely to raise your cholesterol by more than a blip

when came out of a four-year retirement last year it didnt sound like much had changed back with her regular label scratcha dvas following a spell with diskotopia the london producers sound remains familiar is bright melodic and playful is particularly reminiscent of past glories its digisoul chords and deft swung side sticks suggesting uk garage channeled through the post-dubstep of five years ago there are also echoes of another london style broken beat in its jazzy bounce helped by a vocal from elsewhere fidgets in multiple directions exploring a spread of tempos and feels if you squint at the fractured drums and sour arps of youll hear dubstep lurches up to 150 bpm for a take on footworks chipmunk sample scraps and sharp percussion but it cant quite settle flitting between boisterous 4/4 and awkward stasis finally helps flip the script on the closer its a pensive ambient moment interrupted by strangely forceful chord stabs as if cant help but keep things moving along
brancaccio aisher released everybody on bedrock a few months back it was indeed a dancefloor hit that had many in two minds as the lads revealed through an interview on ra it was a track designed solely for the dancefloor and not designed to be dissected the britt mix on the flip was a quality record that pleased those that didn t think the original was their cup of tea a couple of months later another re-incarnation returns this time with tom mangan on rework duties it s a single side release so the pressure is on for mangan to work his magic the production begins with some solid drums that introduce the original electro melody from the original that have been cleverly effected and warped by mangan the vocal gets a cut up and as the track builds in a funky edge the melody gets further abused as the track turns into a dirty electro affair with effects rife in the production the arrangement is also cleverly conduced as it builds and falls throughout keeping it very interesting tom mangan has provided a very good remix to a production that may have lacked some real substance the king britt mix bettered the original just as this mix has bettered the britt mix but of course it s all opinion based and that was mine i do like this mix and if you liked both mixes of the everybody then you are bound to get great value out of this mix
next up on adam freeland s imprint comes a storming release from new talent aka damian taylor and his production the original mix has a great pulsating flow throughout thanks to some rippling basslines and a haunting set of main riffs some subtle guitar riffs give the track a gritty edge while the broken beats flow tenderly throughout it is a very lively track from damian and its more then a worthy release for the marine imprint the melting ice caps dub is a more dubby affair as the name suggests with some deeper basslines and some more rigorous drums there is still that eerie feel to it with the main riffs as well as some effects late on but the disappointing aspect for me is that it has an all too similar style and as such the end result isn t too dissimilar from the a-side
if you know its probably through his releases as damaskin the alias he uses to make rough and grinding techno for his debut album on however the belgian producer softens up considerably shows him throwing away all that rusty metal to let in the softer sounds of the earth the rustling of vegetation the smooth trickle of running water which combine for an almost celestial loveliness its hard to imagine a record better suited to the woodsy ethos of like a less emotional dominik eulberg this is deeper-than-deep techno shrouded in the damp atmospherics of the rainforest has a way of sounding immense but not overpowering the title track coaxes you in with nine minutes of gorgeous nature sounds and then it hits you: one glorious wash of bliss after another almost every track deals with the same elements: whirring high frequencies slow-rumbling basslines and peppy percussive arrangements each sprawling path has a different way of putting these parts together but theyre always hidden under a canopy of trees creating a thick humid air that only makes the album more enveloping there are differences here and there gestures towards dub techno with its rubbery synth leads while recalls the field in how it squashes everything into one graceful blur but fundamentally is an album that lives solely in its own carefully-defined world the lp is so committed to this dense universe that at times it feels impenetrable nless you really zone out to it might seem a little samey it requires a certain ear for detail to pick apart the intricacies in those flowing layers of sound nlike say segues pacifica maybe the definitive release doesnt do much to keep you entertained once youre deep in the album its about the small details that surface in the deluge like the water droplets in wading through you might feel lost deep in uncharted territory where you know youll have to explore for a long time just to make it back to civilization it takes some commitment but as with a long expedition its the moments of beauty you encounter along the way that make it worth the journey
its fair to say isnt someone im terribly familiar with aside from spotting his name on the odd archipel release (but nevertheless failing to fork out) ive had all but zero contact with his work which is my loss because if this ep is anything to go by hes a very good producer indeed title track is a gorgeous piece of ambling tech house neither prosaically minimal nor superficially deep and about as befitting of its title as is conceivable rolling along at a healthy 127 bpm its got plenty of jack (this is a groover if ever i heard one) but its also beguilingly calm blessed with a kind of inner stillness that places it at a considerable remove to the majority of club-oriented summer fodder currently clogging up beatports virtual aisles built out of muffled kicks skittering hats fuzzy bass and bittersweet melodies (not to mention some wonderfully visceral bursts of static) its a texturally rich and structurally lucid piece of music each part seemingly at ease with itself and its surroundings and laced with a kind of wide-eyed innocence thats all too frequently lost in todays hyperactive market over on the flip (this is a digital-only release) label boss lets takes things in a tougher more metallic direction wringing out the originals boozy swagger and replacing it with an ice cold 4/4 snap the likes of which radio slave so successfully trades in it works a treat the thing fairly gallops along and makes for a perfect tonic to the a-sides meandering charms

if you had to send an electronica-loving tourist just touched down at heathrow in the direction of what sums up the sound of london now youd do no worse then point them in the direction of with releases on aus and man make music the all-encompassing eclectic sound of fitzgerald has found its most regular home on scubas hotflush if youre not already familiar with from scubas dj-kicks it inhabits the hinterland between uk garage deep house and dubstep not too far from the borders from techno could have been a mess in most hands but in the best traditions of brit cross-hybridising fitzgerald stitches it together seamlessly trippy synth swells weave in and out a single repetitive note beeps away amid spattering handclaps before a breakdown that takes you to the edge and leaves you there adopts a more classic uk garage feel with plonking tuff jam keys harnessing it to snapping techno drums and with dubsteppy vocal snatches dropped over it eventually heading towards a super-emotive denouement in doesnt quite set the pulses racing like its ep siblings but theres no shame in dropping the pace down a notch stead amid scrunched-up almost tranceyish analogue synths and finger clicks fitzgerald allows himself the space to experiment with some complex tribalish drum patterns this is the sound of a producer whos in the zone
if a recent twitter post is anything to go by paul rose k is only too aware that the dubstep/techno honeymoon has (finally) run its course not that he seems to care: this is his most techno-minded 12-inch to date -side is so thoroughly entrenched in both camps and a good many others in fact that talk of genres seems spurious this is simply club music and good club music at that picking up where his largely overlooked (and wonderful) tense left off it maintains a throbbing rhythmic trajectory but trades that tracks rubbery synthetic unity for a more disparate approach to sonic assemblage comprised of bleary organ-like synth pads bubbly sub-aquatic pops and crackles and periodic disembodied bursts of what sounds like kevin saundersons good life it exists in a murky strangely colourless historical interzone neither reverent nor celebratory but rather frozen and neutral as if locked in cryogenic stasis granted it doesnt quite gel something somewhere is missing but as an exercise in sonic collage its both audacious and compelling meanwhile -side sees rose enter unbridled 4/4 territory with a nigh on textbook instantiation of the erghain/ostgut sheet metal school of techno what he takes from his dubstep background is a healthy sense of swing inhering this in a tightly packed but largely uneventful seven-minute stomp all icy blasts of noise and squelchy clods of bass up there with the sparest of dettmanns or klocks its a bloody-minded piece of dance floor minimalism that mixed appropriately will wreak havoc with early-morning clubbers waning minds nd theres not much the detractors can say to that now is there
theres a point on where a man expresses his surprise at the sounds koalas make and hes followed by a burst of noises you wont want to hear if youre feeling queasy i too experienced surprise at the sounds made by this particular koala who follows up his debut album the carpal tunnel syndrome with a surprisingly warm tender record hilarious in places and introspective in others using the turntable as a melodic instrument in old time music such as basin street blues its clear that a lot of thought and skill has gone into this theres no showboating on the scratching front either - if it aint musical its not included that even applies to flu season a sound picture of two virus-ridden djs meeting in the middle of a street - as funny as it sounds koala occasionally plays piano such as on space cadet 2 and theres a snippet from one of his most loved comic characters grandmaphone more dance music implores you to learn to shake your ass and the closing vacation island is warmly romantic grandmaphone and negatron appear in the accompanying book s comic in black and white illustration like the music its funny tender and painstakingly achieved
in retrospect was always going to end up in ibiza head of the -loving label and a purveyor of chilled electronic music since the 90s he surely felt the pull of the white isle long before he arrived there now hes made it his home barrotts productions have entered a fruitful new phase laced with hazy synths and field recordings from idyllic locations the sketches from n island series is top-drawer from an artist whos been circling the style for years barrotts latest diverts from that series but only really in name the choice of sounds is a touch less kitschy but the blissed-out mood remains undisturbed b-side suggests barrotts still taking inspiration from his new home the title first calls to mind cans 1971 lp (theres a healthy dose of kosmische in barrotts music) but its also the name of an island resort just off ibizas coast the track is pleasantly aimless its bouncy conga lines string and wind patches and bass guitar licks dancing around one another with lazy grace the effect is colourful and chaotic not unlike the chorus of birdcall barrott leaves running in the background is more reclined dive-bombing leads and dusty arps tumble over each other slowly while a light hi-hat and the odd tom take up the pulse we never get to a full beat though no need to go anywhere when youre already home
curvve recordings has shown top form since its first release and this their forth outing follows up the hands in the air drama queen from steve porter which is originally a vocal/guitar piece from michael simone is the first single of the upcoming album from lovesky and here we see an all star line-up take on remix duties first up is wally lopez who puts his stamp on things with the usual jacked-up house mix complete with rumbling beats heavy bassline and tweaked growling stabs that keep up the pace while the originals vocal and swirling melodies filter in and out adding a sublime edge to the angry groove next up is chris fortier who takes it in a deeper direction using atmospheric chords and chunky rolling percussion along with the vocal all the time an uplifting mood floats underneath with subtle piano chords and light pads that ease the pace along lifting gently in places with a more cut up vocal bringing the melody to the fore and taking it a notch darker with pulsating synth stab and heavily reverbed vocal for the last remix its the job of label boss vinny troia who turns out an impressive take with a peaktime prog blend of energetic synthlines and airy sweeps that are made dreamier with long delayed sounds and that smooth vocal that takes the centre stage as the track peels back before powering ahead again all the right elements are in place and the emotive changes in melody make for alot of smiles across the dancefloor track four is the original from lovesky who continues to think outside of the box and create interesting and inventive sounds melding genres together with ease and showing his experimental approach to creating music
you can tell immediately why recorded during the sessions for midtown 120 blues was a favourite of label boss toshiya kawasaki and why it also had to be left off the album the tune bangs (as much as a sprinkles tune can bang) in a way that little else does on midtown 120 blues a true master jackathon run through the unique sprinkles filter fitted with an ear-piercing bit of melody that drops in every so often to remind you of its producer it pumps along in an understated manner leaving plenty of room for bird noise a thunder storm and a choir to make their way into the mix at one point or another sprinkles pulls it all together but its hard to know how: its a rare talent that can make a track this remarkably complex and danceable at the same time a bonus beat and dub fill out the package before kink do what they do best to the original taking things back 20 years for an unabashedly old school remix the duos work often flits between excellent homage and unnecessary retread and this remake falls somewhere in between: it strips the original of everything that made it enticing to home listeners but it also makes it dance floor dynamite you wont find much surprising about the string-laden mini-epic but you also might be master jacking too much to care
we are all americans now sings on from her new album she doesnt mean it as a compliment at the end of two disappointing terms as the us deals with its shrinking global influence and toxic domestic politics the former leader of antony johnsons is asking where it all went wrong she itemises the countrys wrongs drone warfare state surveillance capital punishment a blindness towards climate change and suggests that much of the world is following the uss destructive lead ts clearly a heartfelt view and most people who consider themselves left wing would share it so where does go wrong not with the music itself whose glittering surfaces are a pleasure to the ears has swapped her usual chamber-pop for a brace of beats from hudson mohawke and oneohtrix point never both producers are skilled at bringing mainstream and leftfield together and hudmo in particular is on brilliant form music is grand euphoric and gaudily synthetic and s celestial warble sounds as comfortable in its new home as it did 11 years ago on am a bird now style shift is tactical: the music is a trojan horse to smuggle in the political message and its the message thats the problem trojan horse analogy suggests something sneaky and concealed n fact s views are often so bluntly expressed that they block out everything else her main lyrical mode is sledgehammer irony as on the triple threat of about capital punishment ( have no mercy on me / please have no mercy ); directed at the nsa ( know you love me / cause youre always watching me ); and a reference to this centurys predicted rise in global temperature ( wanna see this world wanna see it boil ) saying the exact opposite of what you think is only slightly more interesting than just saying what you think on repeat listens it begins to seem less so joked in one interview that she wrote the albums lyrics in three minutes and her passionate views are often undermined by the way theyre expressed album is full of clunky non-rhymes and tortuous wordings includes the line case m involved in child molesters an ugly contortion to fit a stiff lyric scheme much of is spent with long melismatic repetitions of the potuss name surely there are more effective ways to have a go at him se details are aggravating because behind them you can sometimes glimpse the brilliant album might have been biggest hint is earth an environmentalists lament over a hudmo beat bursting with romanticism slips into a more poetic style and words and music suddenly mesh good pop is often pliable its message broad or ambiguous enough for listeners to flex it to their taste political pop can be like this without compromising its message but most of has no interest in pliability t regards its audience as either fervent believers in s cause or a pop mass in need of blunt polemic we might all be americans but were not that homogenous
tracks have a tendency to undermine good ideas with lazy deep house tropes has a crushing techno groove its kicks and hats ringing in chasmic space but any interest evaporates under the scorching blast of a jazzy guitar and a vocal loop that may as well have deep samples vol iv stamped on it s sample is also poorly considered mf dooms rendition of william saroyans poem a word of advice was stirring when it opened doomilation but here the disconnect between its depth and the tracks flippant if rump-shaking groove only draws attention to the clich of throwing a spoken word vocal on a house track a tired shorthand for profundity collaborations fare slightly better which features tarri is strongest when the pair dials back on the dusty funk loops (complete with vinyl crackle) and instead let a neatly engineered drum pattern play out unadorned and which sees hook up with long-time producer the is by some distance the eps strongest moment (if you can get over the vocal baubles) with a lithe low-end that bubbles beneath reverb-soaked piano music neednt be smart but is let down by a willingness to follow the most obvious path
epic is a word overused in a lot of circles music reviews not least among them it would be churlish to begrudge and his new track that very description however to my mind at least s earns it first and most obviously of all theres the length for a lot of producers especially those who operate within the house or techno spheres creating a 14-minute track is a sure sign of one of two things; overindulgence or hopeless naivete neither is the case here s seems to evaporate faster than the fleeting scent of an ex-flames perfume and leaves just as powerful of a melancholic impression in the minutes that follow kicking things off with a simple yet strikingly beautiful chord progression it makes its way through metallic clanks off-key percussion and sharp toms with the kick finally relieving the pressure some three minutes in nd then come the strings: sparingly flicks them in and out of the arrangement underplaying what could have overwhelmed in the hands of a less subtle producer has been responsible for some of the most considered and emotional dance music of recent years this track somehow primal and yet exceptionally delicate is an extended snapshot of him at his thought-provoking best
next up on bedrock comes an ep from a very promising talent in 4 tracks are featured and you can expect the usual quality that you normally find in each bedrock release present here as well you wanna do what is first up and it starts the ep in a very moody way with some driving beats that are accompanied nicely with some subtle synths that build nicely for the first few minutes before they are joined by some soothing melodies and a smooth breakdown the track then comes into life with some rumbling baselines and a heavy presence of strong sounds in one hand is a bit smoother and one thing that is noticeable are how crisp the beats and baselines are again there is a strong atmosphere in the track that builds as the track progresses and again the track really builds and takes off after the first few minutes and once the nice melodic patterns are introduced a very good first disc to a pretty impressive debut ep by derek on bedrock
and hauke have put out records together for years s good-time disco-house sound cant escape comparison to their partnership as session victim which will suit most fans just fine and mine a particular house sound: generous with samples festooned in funk and soul a little worn-in one of two tracks here plants earthy double bass scrapyard percussion and tart synth chords onto a cut-and-paste house track s solo work some of which features on giegling edges into sombre moods and theres an echo of that on s contribution loops elastic guitar funk and a deep bassline into a taut disco-house bomb exactly the sort of thing session victim excel at it doesnt have the gently anthemic feel of say 2014s never forget but its understated charisma is typical of the duos catalogue s is the standout a track that sounds like a treasure found after a day of digging in second-hand record bins stratocaster guitar whistles and a cabaret-ish vocal put the music somewhere between dick dales surf rock and 99 records offbeat disco
butchs output is both astonishingly prolific and varied some of his recent work like lullabies to paralyze on visionquest or songs about unconsciousness from earlier this year touched on neo-trance sounds with aplomb that said id wager most people associate b lent g rler with his trackier-than-tracky hits like no worries or drummers drama tunes made with the least amount of elements that are looped for as long as possible he works in that spirit on his first release for seth troxlers label but not only does it feel like a step backwards after a strong run of singles its an uninspired example of the simplest trick up g rlers sleeve is the epitome of butch: a tribal loop repeats and repeats until the rhythm is burned into your brain while weird sounds nature and crowd chatter in this case fill out the background res a huge eruption of cheers and clapping around the midpoint before the loop snaps back into place and continues to its unsatisfying conclusion at least is warm funky and a little hypnotic but is flat-out cheesy a funk break bathed in reverb with a preacher sample it sounds like something youd hear in a trendy fusion restaurant ten years ago is a decent tool to play underneath something else; on the other hand is too distracting to even work on that level
r s has had a new split personality since its late 00s renaissance half techno/bass and half indie electronica the label is defined as much by floor-fillers as it is by the drifting serenity of cloud boat and the latter trio hail from london and represent the somber side of the labels sound though their earlier work had traces of uk garage s debut lp has a different mission it would be easy to write a house record at this time everyone would rave about it frontman lewis rainsbury explained in a recent interview but to me that hasnt got as much longevity as a real record then is the trios attempt to make a real record it has all the breathing passages plaintive intermissions and careful sequencing that define so many indie albums but it seems that in their quest for dignity lost what makes them interesting lands somewhere between james blake and the recent wave of indie pop groups like diiv rainsburys eminently british voice its mellifluous cadences and occasional electronic manipulation is pure blake especially on vocal-driven tracks like and and like the sketch-style songs of the uk star rainsnburys melodies feel half-finished and mumbled its not a bad effect but set against the bands tepid languor it washes over in a wave of grey have their moments: (which dates back to 2010) proves they can write a pop song and here the bands softly brushed drums and liquid guitar strokes contribute to a lovely ebb and flow that persists through the whole album but that set-adrift feeling gets tiresome and on a track like with its slow drum hits and barely-there vocal you just wish it would finally take off and do something it never does the band swim their way through the sleepy-eyed balladry of the title track and attempt to make touching plastic soul with whats most striking is how thoroughly theyve scrubbed their sound of its dance influences with garage only a vague hint in some of the beats late in the album a sampled voice on stands out like phosphorescence in their dreary ocean a simple phrase thats at once more soulful and emotive than anything else here with its rich organ sounds and plaintive guitar it channels the summer nostalgia of beach house and adds some much needed variety but is not an album of movement its stationary and while it might be beautiful to gaze at momentarily by the end of the record its treading water

one cannot expect inspiration to come easy every day seminal micro-house producer marc leclair k told r in 2011 there are moments you have to lay back and observe whats been accomplished if you wish to move forward with a formidable catalogue of music including notable releases on perlon as horror inc leclair is well established in the vanguard of canadas minimal scene with abstract minimal-leaning sounds recently making a comeback now feels like an apt moment for leclair to resurface juxtaposes giddy keyboard plinks with dark brooding pads tame vocal cuts in unnecessarily but an unexpected keyboard solo regroups the piece conforming to more conventional house characteristics filled with infectious choppy samples sounds the most identifiably begins poised as an 8-bit trip before abruptly bopping into a weird boogie in leclairs typically playful style the standout is which moves through swooning strings that are soon joined by giddy blips deep bells and precise two-step percussion
s best records build up ridiculous degrees of tension tracks like amor fati and flashback have almost laughably large drops catchy melodies and interesting textures are also part of the formula but ultimately these tunes are grenades you pull the pin and duck for cover they helped send into the upper echelons of bristol techno and after multiple releases on s sub-label and collaborations with randomer peder mannerfelt and peverelist is his first solo release on proper the title track mixes rolling hand drums with bird-call zaps humid delays and the odd animalistic whoop continuing s penchant for tropical sounds the tinny lead line is classic as is the breakdown in the back third were in his sweet spot and destruction ensues but its also nothing we havent heard from him before the same could be said of the b-side could detonate the dance with delayed vocals a rising melody and a throbbing sub whose pitch changes key to great effect it fits neatly into the lineage of records that made his name reusing familiar ideas that are remarkably effective in the mix the plus-size weapons on will cause damage but i wouldnt be surprised if made these tracks three years ago hes capable of writing with surprising sensitivity this 12-inch for all its underground nous is for big rooms
lthough it may have dropped at start of summer this 12-inch more than deserves a review now not only for its all-out quality but also as a timely reminder of imminent release of s double cd set bro rhood the three cuts here remix tracks from two previous releases ba lon fall collection mini-album and enigmatic which has already seen an echospace reduction is a collaboration between pablo bolivar dub techno veteran and sergio phro a graphic designer and former vocalist with reggae groups better collie and loud and lone their unique take on dub techno is here lured over threshold into three completely distinct territories with striking results sven weisemann opens release with a side-long minimal percussive workout of its some of his best work to date almost magically little bongo runs and rim shots fill out dark cavernous dub spaces with a velvety opulence phros plaintive vocals weave in and out to form melodic shadows as polyrhythms accumulate and break down in haunting waves over a forceful and driving bass pressure in stark contrast to weisemanns more sublime offering is more up-front deep house workout of z richs soultourist collective (this time attributed to philippe w ger ron shiller and tobi schweizer) its immediately more present not just for bigger sounds but also for sly working of snares and hi-hats that add infinite angles and possibilities to sense of movement and make it not only a highly danceable track but one for deep listening madrid duo bove (javier lvarez) and man (jos uel lvarez) round things off with a progressive interpretation of that somehow encapsulates whole set their mix seems at first a nebulous dub techno soundscape until it fills out with hypnotic tribal house percussion and more of phros vocal calls beautiful and danceable it seems to be perfect link between o r two mixes overall unmissable
david hofmann and till gerloffs debut is well-timed their retro disco sound has the same tropes as daft punks random access memories from the basslines right down to the vocoders (not to mention the lengthy runtimes) ut where the french group were trying to replicate the 70s records they loved d rerstuben approach the same aesthetic with nu discos computer-aided lustre makes a good feint its trip-hop-y full of broken beats and smeared vocals until it stumbles into a warm shuffle with alearic guitars and iridescent keyboards g-funk synth lines add to the stargazing quality making for a meaty eight-minute epic with just enough twists and turns to keep your attention on the other hand could be the soundtrack to some travel agency commercial its likeable with slippery synths and pools of reverb but it feels like an exercise in by-the-numbers boogie evoking the same beachside miami vice vibes freiherr is a little more successful bolstering the funky formula with more hooky vocoders d rerstuben have the chops to make some seriously silky stuff but shows that theyll need more than just satin to make a lasting impression
fun its an essential component of all dance music from the sleaziest disco the deepest house the ughest techno you can have serious brooding tracks sure but every set needs a splash of silly genius brighten things up a track turn your mates wag your finger round like a goon and pull a grimace like a yawning sea lion while screaming your lungs silly and the rothers schwarz are renowned purveyors of such joyous delirium go guys for trusty disco weapons when theyve focused their production craft away from the serious side of techno and house theyve spawned absolute classics with that in mind this all star release from the album should be a belter right sadly no nd it certainly isnt fun production wise it sounds more like lef vers from a techno banquet devoured and left long ago s slew of poker flat releases and dry as dust style made him technos pin up boy for a stretch and s contrast between his campy prancing pony dj sets and pumping linear techno cuts has proven a winning formula together theyre an unpredictable duo with tracks ranging from plodding drivel sweaty masterpieces ut compared the brilliant lbertino sounds as stale and thin as it does dry and hollow s trademark percussion dominates from the outset and with no real shift in mood or tempo bar vocalist florian schirmachers villalobosian vocal posturing you begin glaze over by the latter third usually merchants of outrageous twists and turns cavernous breakdowns and slippery funk and just seem content get this one off their chest have turned their deft uch just about every kind of house music this decade has thrown about from deep electro tech minimal which makes it all the more curious that sounds so formulaic with reverb ridden bell chimes and a horrible yamaha sounding synth riff riding awkwardly over crisp drums and random hand claps it sounds lazy and devoid of warmth and invention its not that is bad its just that like the and galuzzi track it breezes past like techno tumbleweed
weve been nattering on at r about for a while now and its easy to hear why: if you hear a track by the group in a dj set it sticks out like a sore thumb of jazzy house emphasis on jazzy the group plays live in the studio and sounds live on record warts bum notes a bit of water in the mixing desk you hear it all in s tunes in a manner similar to kalabrese whose recording philosophy also welcomes the element of chance kings doesnt have much chance to it though its has a loose but unrelenting groove that sits at a regular tempo its a careful balance mixing improvisatory guitar lines a piano that plays around in its cordoned-off chord cluster and a saxophone that flies in from above to say hello but are basically a solid jazz act that doesnt mind sticking to a 4/4 beat ( good thing for us ) ricardo turns up on the -side for a rework of the original that surpisingly doesnt do a lot the celebrated producer strips out much of the middle of the track focusing the groove more intently its a true re mix in that there isnt much added only things pushed up or down to make it even more suitable for the dance floor and ends up making it sound a little bit like what cadenza was doing in its earliest days what dance floors this will star on of course is anyones guess ut let me know when you hear it ill be there
ras nick connellan described phillip lauers debut album earlier this year as yacht rock house if the frankfurt producers remix of s is anything to go by the yacht is now moored somewhere off benirras circa 1999 atop deep resonant bass keys not a million knots away from gat decor s passion in fact lauer interlaces a dizzying stream of twinkling synth melodies and frothy percussion keeping the right side of kitsch it ends up sounding like a million dollars meanwhile wesley has made a (quiet) name for himself with releases on border community and more recently studio barnhus the young welshmans opening take on combines sweeping boards of canada-style leftfield analogue-isms with a deep tech lushness its some radiantly beautiful smart future techno the mix shows another side to mixing up 8-bit tronics with almost imperceptible early electro undertones and a three-quarters speed uk garage riddim
re is a photograph being used to promote presumably an outtake from the booklet that comes with the cd that shows running through a forest she has antlers on her head and is looking back if not in fear then apprehensively its a mysterious image open to numerous interpretations and one that visually represents her new music with a rare accuracy se 16 pieces are transmissions from that state between sleep and wakefulness when your dreams take on a particularly vivid and outrageous quality sometimes they bolt you awake in a feverish panic sometimes you drift on in delicious languor more often those dreams simply tantalise you y are elusive indecipherable and all the more compelling for their ambiguity this is the tone of and the astonishing are cosmic adventures in synth loops that fuse elements of pole classic and fittingly tangerine dream slow elegant and radiantly melodic these tracks are shot through with a deep sadness followed by the fraught choral drama of from forms a high-watermark of emotion which builds to and recedes away from holding your attention through stylistic ebb and flow res a stark awesome beauty to the glitchy nuclear winter of nd t and the beatless dub techno of nd and nd hint at grotty dance floor techno without committing elsewhere rush dips into leftfield electronic pop the vocal tracks and are reminiscent of emikas conservatoire club ballads and on techno-mutated dub reggae morphous as it is state is a very solid body of work

may be best known for noisy post-industrial rock but guided by the curatorial hand of owner powell craig clouse proves that he can do dance music thats just as tough the same rich vein of funk that gives powells releases their sensuous throb courses through s self-titled debut for diagonal its present in the relentless bassline of ; its in the syncopated backbone of ; and it simmers under a cluster of textured rhythms on the signature tangles of noise are as present as ever but theyre more restrained than on previous records s snatches of vocal and piano sustained high tones and light-touch distortion make for something throbbing rather than explosive while s drum-machine thumps and wiry synths are reined in by the inexorable groove is the highlight a scuffed post-punky track with a lumbering drum-led groove and compacted vocal samples its synths sound charred and the drums are brittle but its all anchored by a meaty bassline is the biggest curveball channeling strands of house noise and post-punk into something both alien and utterly compelling

what is it about good house music that evokes a sense that summer isnt too far away its still only spring but already our thoughts are already months ahead tripping out on sunshine and dope beats its in this spirit that ive been giving the latest freerange colour series comp repeated plays on my new wharfedales like previous episodes green 04 is bumpy bassline action in an urban house vernacular solid get things started with a remix of s don t let the girly wail fool you this track is tough the polar opposite of s solo offering an introspective cut that seems to have wandered in off the street onto the tracklist freerange boss himself features twice getting some b off his as with a detroit influenced cut so deep i almost drowned in its tones before flipping the coin with a dancefloor muscle flexing remix for san franciscos justin drops a dirty bomb with while fellow yank s bugs along like something from a derrick carter set elsewhere theres an exclusive new hottie from dubby sounds from as well as more tried and tested deep house from the closest thing to funky house of yore on this cd all of the above amounts to something worth parting with your hard earned for but its the inclusion of two tracks that really makes this a keeper belgian outfit spirit turn in a magnificent acid tinged and sun soaked version of s starchaser that truly captures a summer day spent watching jets streaming across the sky icing on the cake is the beautiful from carl finlow which reminds us that feeling blue also deserves an appropriate soundtrack green 04 points to why and his label have become part of the staple diet of many house afficionados along with buzzin fly freerange is spearheading the fresh house sound coming out of london and the uk dedicated followers know that good house music never dies and that talk of revivals are idle gossip blowing around the yard like loose leaves those who like it deep should beg steal borrow or even better buy this

marseilles aka fr d ric berthet has lately become known for his many excellent disco edits for french label biomix his first release on jay shepheards is all his own work though the guiding hand old disco is still at the fore bolts a jacking disco groove onto a motown-style vocal lamenting the pressures workin two jobs til youre almost dead resulting in a very solid slice summer dance floor material mic s remix adds some deep bass synths and flashing effects to the mix bringing forth a more synthetic hypnotic quality of is more soaring pairing gently ascending pads and a forceful beat with another infectious vocal lays a spanish-language vocal over gentle hi-hats for an altogether more meditative end- -the-party experience but berthets real skill lies in bold disco cuts something thats clear to see on
its true that hasnt shied from the glitch the drone or the odd skipping disc even so his recordings have long offered refuge to traceable tactile sounds whether looped field recordings fragmented vocals or live incorporation of traditional instruments there are usually at least a couple of clear discernible elements amidst the gauze of process s such it probably wont surprise anyone whos tracked deuprees course over the past decade to learn that hes just released an all-acoustic record it all began on a particularly cold and rainy winter day deupree explains in a candid label statement (candid because he also admits to having a cat named pixel ) reaching for a guitar some looping pedals and a handful of other instruments he set out to distill that familiar balance of warm insular indoors and a damp dreary outdoors it was either that or knit a scarf is a creaking wheel of wispy drones melancholy piano murmuring voices and scratchy artifacts bsent almost post-rock guitar appears at the midpoint breaking up the static nature of the loops while inviting still deeper reverie is built from similar components but has a cozier more cottony quality theres a touch of the familiar too with a looped bit of guitar recalling music for irports and a recurring guitar warm-up that seems a direct reference to talk talks scension day (the resemblances may be coincidental but the ancestrys certain ) in addition to housing deuprees first all-acoustic tracks also marks the first vinyl product of s twelve-year history inaugurating a new 7-inch line the new sounds and new format take to one another swimmingly the recordings practically painting a still-life of weathered worn old 45s nd yet id have liked a little more engaging of the limits imposed and opportunities afforded by this format the matter of length in particular confined to four minutes the music pleads for a little more time the vinyl attempts to alleviate this with run-out grooves on each side but theres still a sense of unfinished business perhaps a concession to the brevity issue a digital bonus track gets it exactly right 23-minute slowed-down work-over of clears some elbow room to fully capitalize on an even sleepier pattern of repetition featuring more prominent post-recording treatments its fittingly dubbed the still mix and draws a straighter line connecting these new works to back catalog highlights like stil : it revisits the tricks his fans came to love but still asserts a continued interest in more organic directions

might not have the cachet of some of uk techno peers but if hes going to have a coming-out party this ep is it its the first release on dj deeps recently re-launched label and there arent many tracks better suited for making the transition from the old label to the new than its got an athletic stride that almost makes it house but its sputters and sleek chords are pure techno peaktime business with few moments at anything less than full throttle highlight is as creepy as its title driven by a demented wheeze that sounds lifted out of a horror movie taps into the hardcore territory favoured by artists like tessela but instead of uprooting the track the creaky amen snippets ride along like faint memories of some other record with these elements firmly under the thumb of the straight 4/4 beat you could clock it as either clever or underwhelming ep wraps up with a smooth workout with a palpitating chord like most of the ep it might not expand your mind but its done with such an attractive swagger that its hard not to look at in a whole new light
are a new label on to the scene and they unleash their first release by the name of a production from the studio of beaumont pres elevon the original is first up and it is quite a smooth progressive number thanks to some deep baselines a quirky and enticing melodic pattern and an array of sounds and effects the track has quite a good arrangement that is not conventional and it keeps the production interesting throughout the verdict is a solid progressive production that is quite minimal but enticing simultaneously the arfloteba mix on the flip keeps many of the original moments in tact such as the baseline and surrounding eerie effects the track though does use a different baseline patterns midway in and takes it through a dirtier route later on making this quite a solid remix not a bad way to kick start a label with a release that is pretty interesting throughout
i cant tell you a lot about sw or they might be from norway and its possible they have a loose affiliation to the sex tags mania crew whats made clear on this inch though is that they know left field deep house and they know it well the first release on this label also by the duo contained four lo fi workouts that barely reached 0bpm this ep ups the tempo but keeps the same recorded on a cassette aesthetic the sonic palette used by both sw and is one weve heard before; dusty machines chugging away spitting out thick lows and crunchy percussion the style of the tracks has its roots in classic chi town but takes a detour via the (northern) european avant garde from the drunken stumbling break on s to the gossamer twinkles that juxtapose the funk bass lick on sws effort of the same name sued are giving us plenty of reasons to want to find out more
