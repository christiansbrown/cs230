bedrocks next release comes from one of the ultra talented producers on the scene today - in 2003 the parisians invasion ep took people by storm with a refreshing new approach to sound and in turn put out one of bedrocks benchmark releases this two tracker picks up from where he left off and quickly reminds us exactly why the term inventive usually accompanies a yunus track let go rumbles from the very first beat with a concoction of subtly tweaked sounds together with distant melody that gradually works its way in creating a dreamy vibe the atmosphere is set with effected sounds and pensive melody while more percussive elements are layered ontop and takes it to the next level throughout the track a lush mood is constantly changing while at each turn the pace is lifted further with contrasting shades of deep and uplifting at the same time fever is on the flip side and is a more up-tempo mix of chunky bassline and grooving percussion that keeps us on our toes while a twinkley delayed sound entices us to listen further with the aid of a slight vocal cut a tribal flavour is added with percussive elements while unnoticed more vocally cuts and stabby synth sounds work their way in all the time oscillated synth sounds begin to twist the groove even more and by the breakdown an exalting melody has surfaced while a blend of down-tempo broken tweaked beats keep a flow before filtering back and rewarding brilliantly with a peaktime mix which right till the end continues to alter what makes this music special is the unique and at times magical sound thats created by guvenen who keeps clear of the tried and tested formulas of electronic music and looks to push the boundaries somewhat with an interesting structure to his tracks his music can be minimal at times big-room at times yet holding a powerful emotive flow along with detail in his music which continues right to the very last bar continually playing with the sound
miles whittaker and andy stott treat their millie andrea alias like a costume over their original run of singles from 2008 through 2010 they hid behind their masks to try out jungle garage and juke a tad less serious than most of their music the tracks were often illuminating ( you still got me ) but amidst renewed interest in stott solo and the ascent of whittakers demdike stare millie andrea fell to the wayside stage 2 marked their return in but the disappointing trap pastiche fell flat for the first time ever they sounded out of touch like they were trying to wrap their heads around what the kids like these days in its wake comes their first full-length together and one that sees them sounding comfortable and capable as if to remind us of the duos foresight includes two older tracks that sound remarkably current with their junglist tendencies and crunchy drums and sound very and they sit well with the lps six newer tunes all presented with the same worn facade everything sounds rough and scratchy like the rasp that coughs out of blown speakers that aesthetic that works best on the stellar which fashions rusty rhythms la fxhe into lashing breaks and mournful pads this pervasive bleakness has a numbing effect however and the duo rarely feel like theyre trying anything new murky techno of back sounds like stott by numbers sailing on a distant slowed-down sample only the albums bookends the symphonic decay of closer and the ponderous faucet-dripping beat of gif riff really bring anything to the table even the jungle blitzes feel standard by now when stott let an amen break rip in up box back in 2012 it was breathtaking and prescient when album centrepiece switches from grinding trap into brutal jungle its almost expected thats not to take away from which with its colliding rhythms and loop-de-loop synths is one of the records most memorable tracks but its dampened by a sense of complacency unbefitting of stott and whittaker which might be intentional you could think of those early millie andrea releases as fun little asides that didnt necessarily fit into stott and whittakers respective discographies but were good enough to release anyway if thats the case then follows suit: a solid diversion from two artists who we know can do better
ongos congos marimbas woodblocks and cowbells: producers seem infatuated with percussion these days in the world of dubstep and the first release from the mysterious producer with the everyday name is no exception taking cues from the emerging funky scene and producers like kode9 shackleton 2562 and ramadanman and are two different takes on a similar rhythmic palette is a low-key bubbler stuttering vocal samples drum rolls and eastern-sounding flutes are layered over gloomy synth pads and a lazy laidback bassline the rhythm ticks and clicks on almost as if racing against the slow and rolling pace of the bassline groove is slowly cooked up but it feels too drawn out to really grab you thats not the case on the b-side however is more energetic and lively reminiscent of the start-stop feel of an earlier release ramadanmans limey skittish drum workout contrasted by steady shakers and hi-hats it builds up a catchy groove that is no doubt extremely physical on a proper sound system reverberating chords reminiscent of the sombre jazz stylings of modus operandi -era photek provide a haunting sense of melody along with floating synths fter the second breakdown the mood changes and the tempo is picked up by lighter synth stabs and shuffling cymbals from a multitude of influences builds a distinctive sound with sparse melodic elements thrusting the rhythmic percussion into the forefront which in turn rests upon a backbone of bass this hessle release shows s promising talent; his music unlike his common and indistinctive artist name is quite unique
if i was placed in the middle of a dark club at 4 m trying to avoid the bumps and pushes of a packed dance floor desperately trying to enter my own little world then the reshuffle mix of s would be my ideal soundtrack its the most powerful production i have heard this year it has little resemblance to the original mix originally released by edrock in 2004 but its a perfect example of how sometimes all thats needed to create a great piece of music is a creative loop and clever sound design nd some of the sounds in this production namely the explosion of digital bubbles towards the end of the track are enough to put you in your own little world its certainly not suited to the bedroom the track needs a colosseum-style setting to make sense but thats exactly why john digweed signed it to edrock i cant help but feel sorry for the danton remix its like the unloved brother the one that gets picked on at school and spends a lot of his time on his face liking dirt much like that kid you know that this side of the record will be facing the same way a lot of the time its not a bad remix far from it nd im sure some will probably enjoy the extra element of groove that this remix delivers for many though it will simply be the bonus christmas present hidden behind the very big gift wrapped box delivered by reshuffle
is a little-known alias from cari lekebusch a veteran producer with a catalogue brimming with timeless tunes where much of lekebuschs best-loved work is straight up techno or house (spread across aliases such as mr james arth and phunkey rhythm doctor) is an outlet for more experimental electro-leaning fare there are slamming breakbeats vocoder vocals (a lekebusch trademark) and oddball samples which makes some tracks a quirky addition to dj sets the first release in more than ten years shows two of the projects sides the title track lands closest to s early sounds its a tense electro tune with a halftime rhythm sinister synth squiggles and a hammering bassline that creates a sense of brooding energy most djs will reach for the stoned lice a perfect cut for a partys early hours with dub techno stabs and crisp minimalist percussion its quick (132 pm) but its sparse bassline should get even trippier when pitched down
let s face it: breakbeat can be monotonous while house and techno producers are pushing 4/4 rhythms in new directions their breaks counterparts are still self-imposing limits on the aggressive posturing they do between the down- and the up-beat between the boom and the kat best artists know this and temper their distinctive sound with a diverse approach see evil nine whose breakspoll-winning you can be special too tackled everything from downtempo hip-hop to party bangers all with the attitude and aesthetic of a punk rock band baobinga i d know it too and use their debut album to pursue eclecticism at the expense of a clear identity generic catch-all title says it all after all isn t every breakbeat tune a big monster only thing that unites these tracks is their ability to test soundsystems and the sole ambition of their creators is to cover as much ground as possible geographically fat records manc hopefuls travel from baltimore to holland; generically they touch on everything from broken beat to emotional techno drawing from influences as disparate as carl craig and kyuss all the different styles are successfully executed but don t sit well together is rinsin booty bass the stanton warriors would be proud of and is a neat twist on the hardfloor template of loopy acid house but back to back they make no sense at all despite this lack of focus moments of hint at a fresh utterly unique sound tracks from 2006 of and (a highlight from the stantons fabriclive 30 ) are dark brooding progressive epics with dreamy atmospherics underpinned by growling synths and driving industrial rhythms y along with the equally moody intro outro and interlude suggest that the producers had in mind the kind of breaks record nine inch nails trent reznor would have made but suffered attacks of adhd along the way shame because if baobinga i d had kept their dark-ringed eyes on the emo prize they would have a debut to rival you can be special too or the plump djs eargasm while any attempt to expand the horizons of breakbeat should be applauded listening to gives no clues as to who the producers are possibly because they dont yet know themselves once baobinga and i d have developed their own identity they will be a force to reckon with watch this space

has name-checked the minimalist artist richard serra whose steel sculptures produce a sense of awe through their hulking cryptic presence on his last two albums 2015s transfer energy [feelings power] and last years outing as ceramic tl the adian producer has developed a sonic version of this effect his once club-related music has been stripped of decipherable content leaving vast grainy-surfaced structures that convey something immense and inarticulable the title of his new album might refer to this retreat into a closed aesthetic world but the music itself actually heads in the other direction yond is still unmistakably an album it uses the same harsh synthetic sounds and the same austere semi-rhythmic repetitions some tracks would sound at home on any of his records back to 2013s a/b l infinity (the four-note melody partway through couldve been lifted from that albums title track ) but this time around the arrangements are more mobile the repetitions more tightly knotted and the musics metallic surfaces dulled as if theyve rusted through exposure to the elements in its softer moments this new sound recalls the indie reinvention of s old night slugs colleague jam city ( has a synth pop history too as part of hiawatha ) on the title track a vocoded voice croons over a strangely pastoral arrangement the vocoder comes out again on where it accompanies a slouching almost rock-style backbeat v e p n one of the albums highlights ends with a gorgeous two-chord refrain a moment of fuzzy redemption not so far from jam citys dream a garden compounds the mood through judicious use of real-world sounds opens with the libidinous revving of high-powered car engines before jump-cutting kubrik-style into a dazzling cascade of synthetic sound the cars return later serving as a strangely emotive bookend to closer the last artist to use car engines in this way was e+e in 2013s weepy omega plate like e+es the light that you gave see you s latest brings an element of the human and the mundane into his epic depopulated landscapes his harsher records were more impressive but this one invites affection
it sounds like ricardo villalobos was in a party mood when he made the -side of his latest 12-inch: its among the fastest tunes hes produced close to 130 pm the villalobos rmx of eaver sheppards hovers in that magic tempo range home to timeless tracks like ny ideas que elle epoque and heike mood mix) years after release theyre some of the villalobos productions youre most likely to hear in a club the added pace gives the percussion extra spice a big reason why this -side is another bonafide party rocker its a shame most house djs will pitch it down the latest in a long line of villalobos vocal tracks the rmx lays a nasally refrain from the little-known canadian artist eaver sheppard over a rhythmic bassline and percussion that steadily builds in intensity villalobos has the golden touch when it comes to choosing vocals so sheppards whine like jorge gonzalezs goofy spanish on 2009s aile slots into the percussion wailing over the leaner passages while taking a back seat during the busier sections the rmx lands closer to the sludgy sound of villaloboss only other significant release of empirical house the bassline is muddy and the singing is more ethereal which creates a heady atmosphere theres a hint of classic house in the spoken vocal not heard in the -side buried in the mix which livens the mood when it takes centre stage alongside the sampled guitar in the second half if the rmx was the happy bomb this is the drift into space
takes its name from a mountain in southern france well-known for the intense climb it gives cyclists each tour de france nicknamed the beast of provence the legendary route is where yorkshire native james welsh aka attempted to break a cycling world record with four others as he puts it a lot of time was spent alone in pain in extreme heat in the dark with wild animals etc i had a lot of time to think about how i wanted this record to sound though it might not be a typical inspiration for electronic music (you know aside from one instance ) the conceit feeds welshs high-gloss techno some burly force bursts out the gate with momentum of a downhill race; the sharp skipping hi-hats in and set a mean pace for endurance riding but for all that forward thrust welsh is at his best when handling the musics unexpected curves setting the bike metaphors aside does great work with tightly wound rhythms gnarled acid tones and traces of bright synth melody (the title track is especially deft with its ricocheting chords and dizzy high-octave lead ) the sound makes welsh a perfect fit among s ranks alongside the likes of daniel avery and ghost culture but you could argue its too perfect: the growling bass of and s frantic pulse echo a few of drone logic s heaviest tunes and beatless cosmic closer canap the two most melodically interesting tracks here point to more distinctive ideas however and will hopefully set welsh on his own path
is the new label just launched by the dutch duo pako and frederik (global underground bedrock majestic) its first release comes from the pair going under their family names storm karkand on the a-side goes back to the chunky groovy and lush vibe that has been a little difficult to find in some record stores of late deep but fun solid but not hard standouts are the lovely warm bassline and integrated pad work - classically beautiful with tasty muted analogue blurts on the side essentially house this is a very accessible track for earlier hours or a mix cd and has enough energy (supplied by bass and addictive higher percussion) to get feet on the floor people go to a danny howells extended gig early for this kind of track complete nansensu on the flip is the progressive trance mover here starting off with a magical light synth pad that rises and falls along with slightly more intense electronic elements it has a very listenable intro but probably wont be heard unless a plucked echoed synth loop is used to match it - go on i dare you thereafter a kick that will get your neighbour calling the cops comes with a pulsing bass while a gated acid line and tons of perfectly layered synth work provide aural entertainment theres also some key changes and a breakdown thats just right for this kind of rushing electronic vibe - it has mystery but is not too long and keeps the energy well finishing off firing on all cylinders on this first release for illustrate they know how to produce quality sounds and arrangements and know what elements work well together storm karkand will just about fit in any house djs box whilst complete nansensu will find itself at the centre of many 3am peak progressive moments for sure great start to a new label
is a new label with a roster that in some respects feels like the brighter west london counterpart to the global explosion of east london inspired grime the beats are fast broken and heavy on sampled vocals but theyre also brighter favouring contours over jagged edges pastel over neon fter a wide ranging digital compilation earlier this year label boss begins vinyl releases with help from londons king of the effervescent r b cut up has long been a dark horse in the uks ever expanding club scene his tracks mostly edits are infectious and giddy their samples chopped with a ninja like mix of agility and precision the style makes his dj sets feel impossibly breathless on (based on 50 cents 21 ) the guitar sample loops back on itself perfectly the quick stabs sounding almost romantic on the flipside throws in another early 00s sounding r b cut up features more nimble chopping harnessing the energy of a strummed guitar these are simple loops but theyre done with an almost artisanal level of craftsmanship making them feel like more than the sum of their parts
you dont have to look far to find carbon copies of old dance music what so many artists forget when they borrow from bygone eras of garage grime hardcore or jungle is the sense of endless possibility and subversion that made the original stuff so exciting logos and mumdance together and seperately have done a remarkable job of tapping into that feeling their work is rooted in the past yet still fresh and modern taking classic tropes and brazenly throwing them into new configurations while the two have conjured up the ghosts of og grime in the past looks back even further than that homing in on a time in the early 90s when dance music was prone to rapid mutation if theres one difference between the music here and the music of yore its that feels unerringly mechanized you can hear it in the records bookends the portentous which beeps metronomically like a robot on patrol and a calm shoreline rendered in crude pixels theres an equally rigid approach to tension and release builds up and lets off steam with precision isolating a roaring bassline or ticking hi-hat and forcing each to thunder into the void alone just like their stylistic forbears logos and mumdance use rudimentary techniques to spice up their stark palette and sound as if theyre ripping through the fabric of time itself la early jungle while lets its drum sounds disintegrate and splinter with each new pass through the gauntlet its a crude time-stretching effect that sounds absolutely deadly the slight feeling of familiarity on is the records only flaw coming from the two guys responsible for mission and take time a direct glance to the past could come off as a compromise that said logos mumdance are also the duo behind in reverse a tune that sounded insane when it dropped in 013 and all because of the rather simple flourish of its backwards samples similar strokes of genius are all over a record that shows you dont always have to be flashy to be futuristic
originally issued on s snapshots ep in 1995 was a chord-filled techno homage with lush analogue bass the prolific rod modell and stephen hitchell have created five contemporary dub techno interpretations loosely based on the original track echospace one is best described as chilly over the course of 13 minutes layers of percussion and chords fade in and out while reverberation and filters are slowly tweaked the end result feels more mechanical than its source material though that doesnt necessarily make it less worthy of a dance floor s the music plays unbidden visions of time-lapse nighttime cityscapes spring to mind the deepchord remix begins with swirling digital snow the bass is thick yet indistinct double-time chords evoke inevitable memories of asic channel the mix grows dense then gradually elements fade leaving sleigh bell-like woodblocks next on the digital release are three bonus tracks starting with the harder shorter (at under ten minutes) echospace two congas and spacey treble synths play loosely over a simple three-note bassline the deepchord rebuild starts strong oddly shaped pulses move over a low heartbeat unfortunately it winds down gradually by its end all the best parts have disappeared the deepchord tmospheric rebuild is certainly the most original mix of the lot lien pitches alternate with a hum evoking gregorian chant modell and hitchell are dauntingly productive but experiments like this which are still surprisingly rare in techno music make following them worthwhile

the melodic emotionally driven house sound thats been so popular these past few years shows no signs of stopping at least for now dixon the styles most famous exponent was recently voted the 1 dj in the ra poll for a fourth time and last year the sound appeared frequently at the top of ras monthly top 50 which is generated by djs charting tracks the german artist butch doesnt exclusively produce these kinds of weepy dance floor moments but over the years hes shown a soft spot for them on he again links up with the musician and producer c vogt (among other bits they released a strong jazz-influenced single together called the infamous ) and for better or worse they capture the spirit of where so much house music is at these days butch is known for writing arresting grooves and he does so again here teems with percussion hand drums shakers what could be manipulated vinyl crackle and the overall effect is enveloping (a beat tool version of the track emphasises this ) c vogt a pianist and saxophonist naturally brings a sense of musicality to his work with butch and while he doesnt go for it in the way he did on the infamous theres a depth to the melodies that stands out the tracks dramatic breakdowns toy piano melody and indulgent string swells could together pose the question of where you stand on this style generally put another way its a moment where youd either leave the dance floor shaking your head or have your night taken to the next level butch and c vogts handling of these moods is pretty exemplary (the track was 1 on ras dj charts for december ) but like any music style with a single defined emotional quality its likely these expressions will eventually lose their potency
has been pc musics de facto dance floor correspondent since western beats even so if you told me last year that an artist from pc music was releasing an ep on turbo id have looked at you funny its an unlikely affiliation that came about through a remix competition west won wherein he remade an already silly tiga boyz noize track with a goofy bassline and cheap presets as with the stark simplicity of western beats however there was a certain charm to it enough to warrant a full ep on tigas label is both fun and frustrating the hallmarks of wests 100 remix are all here particularly the insistent squiggling basslines and the stiffly-programmed hand percussion (including what might in fact be too much cowbell) the recipe works best on a breezy track where the cowbell gets spun and delayed like its caught in a wind tunnel those little effects go a long way and theyre sadly missed on other tracks like the flat mad decent-isms of dont and its listlessly repeating vocal sample has a wonky lead that sounds like a kid going nuts with the pitch wheel on a casio keyboard and the wacky noise makes its drab backdrop somehow more underwhelming the title cut is almost as good as however and is a banner example of what made western beats interesting that freewheeling ep looms over which tries to fit into techno and house templates at the expense of the na ve charm that characterized wests earlier work
ewan smith is among the uks new wave of house producers though he prefers a more reserved sound than some of his garage-influenced peers the disarray ep on hypercolour from earlier this year found him in a reflective mood and his first ep for sees him withdrawing further inward the four-tracker is a particularly shadowy take on s usually lighter sound the result is luxurious and sexy even at its most languid smith exploits underground qualitys zoned-out aesthetic but does so with a giddy zip befitting of his homeland drops melismatic vocal cuts and ethereal keys on galloping drums that almost feel too rough for the delicate structure theyre supporting be meanwhile spruces up its cavernous abode with an organ melody that slides around the bend of every bar like its trying to outpace the beat need is simple blissful waves of melody riding a workmanlike beat but the way the sounds are filtered thinning out as if put through a sieve adds some detail starting out as the smoothest jam with its gentle bassline and softened string stabs unexpectedly drops a sharp hi-hat threatening to poke holes in the serenity below its this kind of contrast that raises smiths work above the fray of uk house producers
what would you do after recording an album like movements how would you top it would you even try after tracks as anthemic as mandarine girl and in white rooms anything less uplifting would seem like a come down so if you re not gonna top it what are the other options go faux fairy acoustic hey it s working for goldfrapp kind of or maybe you could try becoming the love child of leonard cohen and tom waits brinkmann does a pretty good job of it receiving the promo copy for s new ep this is what i was wondering: where would take their sound would they consolidate make a transition or try something radically new the cover suggested concessions to new rave (egad all those colours) but somehow i just couldn t imagine the duo abandoning their signature sound the result is something slightly less the the club mix of is carried by a melody heavily indebted to 80s synth pop like yello and telex hitched to a fun-loving and well-made tech-house structure with lots of dry ping-pong beats and a heaving synth-bass line ornamented with some squiggles and whistles it s nice enough but nothing special unsurprisingly the dub mix of presents more or less the same arrangement minus the melodic hooks it s a serviceable minimal track the pick of the three is the b-side the neon dub of one of the sonic features of the track is a looped hit that sounds a bit like the ring-pull on an aluminium can being plucked in fact this is really the only truly memorable thing about the whole ep don t get me wrong there s nothing to dislike about any of the material here it s just that after the last note fades there s just no compulsion to hit repeat and when you do revisit it well if you re me you ll just have this uncanny feeling of being underwhelmed again at least until you hear that enjoyable ring pull noise is this really the same production duo that made music as hyperdramatic and emotive as night falls or body language i guess the guys are trying to be subtle after the bombastic excesses of movements but when the overall effect is ever so slightly underwhelming you start wishing they d indulged themselves with a regression back into peaktime 2006 either that or taken up the ukulele
s conceptual precision on is admirable all tracks written and produced using only his mouth as a sound source its a pretty good hinge for an album and a good way to get critical attention even if the idea is cribbed more-or-less from herberts bodily functions (herberts evidently been listening too ajus now releasing via herberts accidental imprint ) these self-imposed limits can help hone an artists aesthetic necessity being the mother of invention and all that but an artist can also become a cropper for these restrictions play your cards wrong and youve got a record thats all talk and no backbone aju (aka san francisco based dj/producer marc barrite) has largely managed to avoid that outcome though there are a few moments here where youll wonder whether hes fighting a losing battle those particular tracks are mostly front-loaded on so dont give up if you find the circular characterless or the cringe-worthy lyrics on (which is otherwise a serviceable if unremarkable pass at the bumpty bump) frustrating if they test your patience as much as they did mine skip straight to in many ways ajus breakthrough moment its as thrilling now as it was when it started circulating earlier this year squeezing disco toms woodblock percussion and hissing hi-hats from his lips and tongue he builds a limber groove to frame a breathless vocal round its even better when remixed by luciano at the end of the cd: the pace increases ajus whispered asides are threaded into a series of urgent nervous tics a juddering riff cuts up the track like scissors through cellophane before a keyboard solo finishes up somewhere between maddeningly repetitive and gloriously aleatory elsewhere takes on broken beat others have rightly noted its close to reggaeton territory though the real thrill here is the morse code walkie-talkie melody that squeezes from the headphones about two minutes in plays out as a tribute to p p bradocks mix of iz dizs mouth from cheek-popping snares through slippery ballooning bass and pinprick chords its got the same compulsive bounce as bradocks mix and its attention to detail is lovely (watch out for the squelching slurps and swallows that pop up every now and then) on tracks like this works because while its concept is ultimately subservient to the overall composition you cant imagine these tracks functioning in quite the same manner or having the same impact without the particular tenor of ajus mouth-noise on tracks like and aju measures himself admirably and an album full of tracks of their quality would have gone down a treat but there are some stumbling blocks on here largely i suspect due to ajus desire to reach across genres to do disco do r b do broken beat and so on i think he might have got a little lost in that desire to canvas as many genres as possible its a good album at times genuinely diverting but would have benefited from more focus

while there once might have been shame in underground artists cuddling up to the mainstream the border between the two seems to be vanishing in not least with the advent of artists like disclosure s first single the -assisted vocal cut is a commercially viable slam-dunk in the vein of that young uk duo t works in the club sure but its appeal unmistakably lies with its chorus which has a way of getting stuck in your head for days on end the man behind this particular alchemy is will saul a uk producer whos using the name for his most unashamedly accessible music n a way it seems natural: hes just taking the already polished house of his labels simple and us and molding it into other shapes but its also a rather risky move for a world-renowned house dj despite what the infectious bounce of seems to imply is more of a downtempo record ts most memorable moments like the woozy synth spill of come from the way sounds reverberate around the wide-open sound stage reveling in their own splendour this is a lush record that sounds like it could have been recorded for a major label everything is engineered to be as smooth as humanly possible even the few beat-driven moments feel more concerned with lavish detail than dance floor impact is also predictably heavy on vocals offers smoky soul while features on the ballad the best vocal spot comes from rhythm sound veteran on the fantastic n which enrobes basic channel dub in sauls shiny oil slick here thundering slabs of low-end are replaced with dub sounds reverberating through an immaculate echo chamber softening sauls sound while also making it more powerful but that softening reveals s nagging issue: sauls new baby has little personality outside of its glossy production the problem manifests itself most with the burial pastiche where the done-to-death sound is inflated to theatrical scale losing any grit or impact that might have made it interesting in the first place s nice and welcoming as is itll never challenge you taking sounds youre already familiar with its a velveteen affair so utterly soft and pillowy that it can pass by without making much of a mark
when you get down to it whats the real difference between house and disco latest release from detroit underground hero andr s (also known as dj dez) and the debut of his new label openly flirts with both and comes out triumphant and universal in the process the is a sample-heavy groover based around a forceful but graceful drum loop as soulful vocals and strings emerge from vinyl crackle rickety but smooth all at once meanwhile lives up to its name with a roaming acoustic bassline that recalls the virtuosic work of someone like paul chambers as it darts around underneath a cool-blue rhodes melody ut its the title track which revs things up considerably that deserves the attention here slightly inescapable in so far and for good reason has a crunchy tape-worn groove that hobbles with a gravelly warble that brings to mind the same warm fuzzy feelings as vintage larry levan mixes suave keys only further drive it into territory that you might have found on salsoul in the late 70s instantly indelible part is the sterling strings however which swoop in flamboyantly swinging and swaying in full-on disco bliss skewed halfway between a bygone era and an ideal present and rendered with enviable ease is simply timeless no matter what you want to call it
is chosen to provide only the 2nd release on this newly formed sister label that is is first up and it is the pulsating electro baseline that really makes this track what it is nice crisp clapping hats also help to kick the track as well as the deep dubby baselines that drive the track subconsciously in the background not a bad track at all rhythmique on the flip for me has slightly more depth with a smooth baseline meeting some great melodic twirls and smooth cut up vocal snippets not as abrasive as the a-side and for me it s the highlight of this release not a bad release here on electric check out the b-side in particular

okay first a confession: i got into electronic music at psychedelic trance parties one minute i was like this music is bullshit and then someone gave me a little pill and an hour later i was all this is the fucking best music ever invented i didn t understand for a long while that trance was the runt of the dance litter i d talk to househeads at parties and try to convert them to sixteenth bass notes i d groove on the deep synth-ness of records rather than their rhythmic jump i d dance with my hands instead of my hips which is why the sound appeals now there s a kind of hypnotism in loooong held synth notes a respect for sustain tune and most importantly notes no matter how much the techno and house contingent would sniff at it it s a style that works people there is pleasure in notes and just because it s an effects knob doesn t mean tweaking it makes you innovative its a thousand year old fact but the harmonic scale makes dumbasses like me swoon which brings me to who s very young and swedish but has a way with a tune previous release on border six songs was a nice slice of nu-prog and is more of the same if a bit dirtier and messy as is the border tendency of late a-side is more than okay melding border bass programming with the new euro trance tendency (chardronnet landsky minilogue) maybe it s not 100 shake-your-ass but there s enough rhythmic momentum bounce and modulation to intrigue the lazy fat people on the dancefloor pity that it never reaches full steam after the breakdown djs would do well to mix this into something else with a little more kick because it s not going anywhere b-side untight is more to my taste: six minutes of continuous build knows the power of a shredded synth feeding the constituent parts inside each other so moment to moment we get a fine view of the beauty of each pity it s a bit rough and thick and raw but you do get the feeling that each section has been lovingly pored over it s not eight bars of this and then eight bars of that what i want for christmas is for producers to marry prog-trance builds with minimal techno attention to detail leave the rough to rock b2 is the beatless ambience of less exciting which is certainly well named but it feels like floating on a cloud and maybe that is enough sometimes all in all this is pretty swoonsome stuff from border i got over my psytrance hump but if hypnotic synths are going to be rehabilitated (and rest assured the techno snobs will dismiss this one just as day follows night) it s stuff like this which marries a respect for analogue tones with trance builds that s gonna do it
does classically-trained musician versatile dance floor producer experimental soundtrack composer simply want a hit that seems to be what suggests the lead single in anticipation of her soon-to-be released debut album making use of a simple progression built on solid bass and eponymous vocal repetition its a finely-weighted piece of deep house that will rescue more morose tracks in the mix with its delicacy and charisma it takes no risks but to do so would seem contrived tevo favours a jerky high-end approach and puts some echo on the vocals its a stripped-down break-infused percussion fest draped in analog warmth daze s interpretation provides the greater departure with a dense kick and murky production it offers a completely different dynamic to the other two mixes and is refreshingly dark theres definitely a clear sense of purpose in each of these mixes and they do serve to highlight different aspects of the compositions capabilities from the bordering-on-cocktail-bar-ambience and foot-tap tempo of the original through to the momentously driving remix by daze and tevo holding the middle ground with a version that encourages freestyle expression on the floor this is a solid release with soul
just when youd thought had crossed over onto the other side of house with his smash hit re-take of owner of a lonely heart from yes hes back to re-affirm exactly whats got people talking about him in the first place this tasty double a sider comes compliments of sander kleinenbergs little mountain recordings imprint the first track of which is automatic weapon it starts off in a fashion that has us hooked with a narcotic bunch of driving beats and filtery melodies that keep up the pressure while hypnotic vocals continuously add to the suspense the build is complete as were taken up and down and back up again on a euphoric trip does she know yet is just as sweet taking its time to unfold a mix of peaky beats and gentle melodies that begin to blossom as the track gathers pace before we know it the track is in full swing and the stabby synth riff has complete control over the flow taking it back down to the end is an artist who has risen quickly to become one of the leading lights of the uplifting house scene over the last few years and of late is creating a new awareness
now that we can hear s emergence series in its entirety it doesnt seem to chart an emerging style so much as a kind of decay from the punchy ruffneck hybrids of emergence 1 each instalment has become more sprawling its rhythmic grids stretching almost to breaking point the last of the trilogy was written in the canary islands with a batch of new gear and it sounds like the london producer was still getting to grips with it all the drums lack weight and some of the synth elements are a bit thin ut s music remains a fascinating abstraction of uk dance styles you wont find anything else quite like it oth tracks follow similar contours starting with a pulse-less scree of drums this gathers into a groove that would resemble uk garage if you plugged a few of its gaping holes fter a while chords enter and shoulder their way into the foreground for the breakdown before the duck-and-dive drums return to play us out is the stronger of the two thanks to a few touches reggae-style chords that ping across the stereo field odd reverb detonations triggered by the percussion lack doesnt work so well its quivering chords sap the momentum rather than build it and that fractured groove threatens to fall apart altogether
in a recent interview with ntss jon rust said she went through a creative dry spell last year not long after the release of her third ep universal glow on julio bashmores broadwalk records she put this down to her windowless and uninspiring former studio and also how she felt artistically in the aftermath of that record she gets her groove back on her latest outing a two-track ep on her own brstl label sounds like it was put together during a particularly bright spell of british weather it has a perky framework of rugged kicks cosmic synths and a rude bassline just before the two-minute mark wonderfully loud chords burst into view flooding the track with warm rays its such a simple record basic even but its unrefined feel is part of the charm on celeste turns her hand to techno almost everything about it is cleaner and more intricately interwoven from the kicks and hi-hats to the strip-lit pads and flute-like melody celeste says shes noticed that people tend to feel strongly about which of these two tracks they prefer but whichever way you swing both rank among her best work
s is billed as a blueprint for karma no kusari group-member kiki hitomis album from last year but in fact these are radically different records karma no kusari bridged jamaican reggae and japanese enka in whimsical doses melancholic pop and psychedelic dub conjuring a drifting sound world as strange and nomadic as the artist herself meanwhile is very much grounded in berlin specifically in the diy noise and art scene that s artists belong to along with hitomi those artists are dj die soon dj hotel and dead fader dj die soon is one the five founders behind the small but hard label and a producer noisy and rambunctious hip-hop check out his last lp for le petit mignon dead fader is also part the sbh clan though in recent years his music has moved toward swooning neo-classical dj hotels music mostly exists on bandcamp he favours a submerged ambient and techno style that breezes between the haunted and the dreamy documents those artists coming together with hitomi on the mic for a session in berlin in 2014 every track was improvised and recorded in a single take allegedly 44 them in total whittled down to these 13 the album moves like liquid a near-continuous flume sound burbling gushing and immersive hitomis voice rarely forming audible words is distant and swathed in reverb as though beamed into the room from far away her presence is more like an apparition gauzy and hovering over the entire record unlike the central role she plays on karma no kusari is the only obvious link between the two records its the sketchy precursor to walkers the second track f hitomis solo album as karma no kusari trained the spotlight on hitomi and her personal life pulls it back to expose the musical environment that shaped her: diy experimental and coarse by definition she is not the star though its a group effort and the din sound produced by dj die soon dead fader and dj hotel is compelling throughout you are coddled by it even when things turn spiky drawing from a well bass angst abstract machine song glitch and corroded hip-hop is a glinting diamond in the rough

defected squeeze a little more from their big summer anthem by releasing further remixes of a collaboration between bulgarians and kink opinion remains split about whether fcls remix of its you was genius or a case of the emperors new clothes ir mix of adopts similar techniques as that track most notably in its approach to bass for much of the remix they rely on tangerine dream-style arps to bolster rows emotive vocal and build the mood nd then in comes a booming bassline accompanied by ambient washes it would be tough to deny its effectiveness ben westbeech another producer with a summer smash under his belt takes a less subtle approach with his breach hat on his remix a tribute to robert perhaps dispenses with 99 9 of the vocal in favor of pummeling kicks military drums and a wild garagey bassline despite being the tracks co-writer and producer (as well as s significant other) kink still finds new ways to dress up the original he wraps a crushing breakbeat around a swollen techno rumble to prove theres plenty of juice in yet
as an artist and a person grew up fast he released his first 12-inch at the age of 16 and was quickly hailed as detroits next great house producer endorsed by local icons like theo parrish and omar-s by the time we profiled him in 2009 hed produced dozens of tracks launched his own label ( ) and was getting booked around the world a few years later hed already developed a wary view of the dance music culture he was now a part of in 2013 he released the boat party an album he says was about the appropriation of black music from a disenfranchised city juxtaposed with luxury european club culture and boat parties halls second album harks back to simpler times it collects eight recordings from before 2010 when he was still a teenager living at his dads place free to spend countless hours making tracks in the basement the house was on joy street in detroit but the joy in the title refers to more than that for me the idea of joy is an individuals experience of freedom hall recently told the fader for many it can be seen as a return to youth not having obligations gives you a certain weightlessness that allows for continued creativity clearly emanates from a mind at ease throughout the album theres not a grey cloud in the sky the melodies are soaring the rhythms upbeat the overall mood one of total optimism many of halls other records show him mutilating his influences into strange and almost unrecognizable sounds here he channels them more faithfully with clear echoes of funk jazz and soul adding to the carefree feel as usual with hall the compositions are raw in a way that makes you picture him banging them out on an mpc the parts hang together loosely but reliably like players in a band off-kilter loops form a shimmering backdrop for live improvisations mainly on rich pianos and buttery synths though hall says jazz wasnt a conscious influence on the record its rhythms have that rollicking flow on damn im stuttering kick drums follow tattoos of snare hits with the two parts never falling on the downbeats is a weightless swirl of strings piano and upright bass with hardly a kick drum to speak of most of the tracks ride swung house grooves but and are slower and more syncopated one of the albums more streamlined tracks has the delirious motion of someone rushing down a flight of stairs at face value is wall-to-wall good vibes but theres a streak of melancholy to it as well for hall these tracks capture a time and a state of mind thats gone forever the weightlessness of youth he felt before the pressures of adulthood bore down on him back then he couldnt have known that one day having made it as an artist hed long for those sessions in his fathers basement yet here he is trawling through recordings of his younger self enshrining them in this lovingly packaged lp as a house album is as bright and colorful as the painting on its cover but its also something bittersweet: an ode to an era gone too soon
s we heard on his excellent debut the story bout you s sound is warm romantic and inviting (just look at the title here) this new ep continues in that vein where spare 4/4 frameworks are established early on and the main focus of each track is essentially about how the resulting gaps are filled most often its with a roughshod collection of pinging toms sharpened claps and swirling pads though plenty of found sounds also lurk within the title track is aptly named for its modern lullaby overtones if you have young kids the soft edged and rippling chords which roll over more kinetic beats and hi-hats might be the perfect thing to send them off to sleep muffled sax and male voice also infuses the already fuzzy ambiance with yet more soulfulness while is the sound of playing outdoors on a hazy and lazy summer afternoon finally a again does that trick of pairing fairly firm well-defined drums and crisp percussion with more rolling and incidental melodies and streams of earthy hues
politics and electronic music didn t used to be such strange bedfellows in the nineties mille plateaux bolstered its empty clicks n cuts collections with post-structuralist deleuzzian drivel terre thaemlitz used his machines to explore gender politics and ekkehard ehlers released an album with the twin towers on the cover and politik in the title yet somewhere along the way these overt political statements largely disappeared especially in the dance community in favour of music produced purely for pleasure throughout his varied career matthew has explored various positions within these arguments from producing seemingly innocent house music to demagogic musique concr te diatribes his personal contract for the composition of music prohibits him from using pre-existent samples of any kind but that hasnt necessarily prevented him from releasing warm inviting dance music its when the politics overshadows the music that things become problematic; well-intentioned and admirable it may be but ultimately it s difficult to enjoy listening to is arguably s strongest fusion of political ambition with pop listenability to date rhythmically it slinks by with a lithe disco/house swing and with its reliance on brass and strings it owes much to the 1970s were in love padded with lush harp lines and syrupy strings wouldnt sound out of place on board the love boat and after a cinematic introduction just once moves to a chorus fit for the bee gees elsewhere things skip and stutter like matmos at their funkiest (harmonise) and the background is often buzzing with digital detail (723 objects were sampled including an raf bomber coffins petrol pumps meteorites and vomiting) but its the acoustic instruments which dominate both the movers and the shakers and moving like a train with the addition of s big band pound and swagger like prime stevie wonder or michael jackson like those artists its the voice that takes centre stage something has shown considerable skill with since his early house productions his partner dani siciliano takes the spotlight alongside dave okumu (jade fox sa-ra creative partners) and neil thomas and alone or in harmony they are frequently sublime opener something isnt right is immediately catchy beautiful and danceable but the albums highlight is birds of a feather a rich hybrid of electronics strings horns and sicilianos voice which is swoon-inducing thematically and lyrically is concerned with oil and the violence involved in its acquisition but these flew past me at first listen - all i caught were phrases which could just as easily appear on love ballads; however a line such as im on fire could here refer to something far more sinister than tearing up the dancefloor references to terrorism war and political impotence delivered so sumptuously make a complex proposition: an attempt at political subversion through both direct commentary and sheer delight and for those offended by s ideology its an album which can be easily enjoyed simply as a collection of satisfyingly clever pop songs

we strongly believe that music has the ability to change your state of mind and body reads part of the mission statement from ucharest record label true to their words the labels releases have been aimed at both the feet and head all dealing in the kind of ethereal and hypnotic textures that work best when looped and delicately manipulated zefzeed best known for his work on labels like ll inn and ody parts is the latest minimal producer to turn to brighter sounds after building his career with a dark and dubby palette offering as s fifth record the murky squelch of zefzeeds earlier records is still present on but now its bundled with a collage of simmering proto-house synths and pads that could be larry heard its a slow-burning warm-up cut and a handy one at that vlad ups the intensity on his remix making jack harder than most ten-minute tracks this stripped-down this 12-inch will appeal to anyone enjoying minimals recent embrace of brighter colours
when uk techno veteran dave clarke hooked up with mr jones to form a little over 18 months ago he hadnt set foot in the studio for more than six years nevertheless the duos first release together smacks of nothing but laboured experience made up of three versions of the same track the central template is a thundering groove with crisp kicks that cut through a coarse bassline on the warped synths meld with the mangled growls of us vocalist bear who whose repeated claims to be the rhythm rider command attention atop the pummelling framework although difficult to stomach at times its brutality is all part of the charm the instrumental mix leaves the tracks many elements to writhe and contort in greater clarity while the isolates the vox and the synths making for a potentially devastating tool
nhkkoyxe s dance classics material is streaked with colour as gleefully deranged as the indian holi festival the japanese producer real name kouhei matsunaga has roots in hip-hop and experimental music though these days he nourishes himself on a diet of techno in berlin his style is an accumulation of these influences with bouncy elements contrasted by darker shades matsunagas latest album for dance classics vol iii continues the trajectory set by the first two editions tracks like and playfully billow in his signature style the latter fills the bombastic techno-funk role filled by 112 off dance classics vol ii in addition to this are the crunchier textures of and an agitated ten-plus minute opus that starts prettily enough but then sporadically threatens to derail as bugs in the bassbin wreake havoc with the rhythm to the point where the track finally collapses onto itself this kind of rhythmic derailment is a central theme on dance classics vol iii its explored further on the captivating a track whose layers unfurl and reassemble its melody pockmarked with little blemishes then theres the almost comically aggressive which is like a more violent version of rroses 2011 epic waterfall here the eqing is unpredictable and erratic as if an agitated cat has been dropped on the mixing desk matsunaga seems hell-bent on fighting the established dos-and-donts of dance music i want to go outside from these limitations he said in a recent interview on ra he slaps his listener across the face just as their attention starts to fade its a fight hes winning: dance classics vol iii is at turns challenging difficult and strange but its never boring
greg patterson aka is a liverpool based producer who makes his debut for yo with their second release his first workings tricks was released on junior and with this follow up we can expect to see greater things from this producer respond with large support from digweed there is no doubting the effect this track would do in the clubs everything seems to be made with a powering and almost overwhelming nature strong hooks and riffs peak out and slide in with devastating effect while a vocal sample gets the twisted treatment the breakdown gets very nasty as some serious noise builds up then drops out leaving jaws dropped add to the mix an assortment of effects sounds and synths and you have one big ass club track what you want here we get a little dirty with low thumping basslines and aggressive hooks which compliment a seriously perfect melody think of an old tinny organ sound and that s what the melody consists of rolling synths assist in sweet breakdown goodness then drops in deeply with an almost haunting effect while the flip side track achieves hard controlled beats what you want floods the senses with an edged melodic house number
one of the three remixes on s stands apart from the others dva turns her tender into an eight-minute soundscape of pensive synths and samples taken from kim kardashians snapchat sounding somewhere between pop art and pan lanzas presence is reduced to a looped sample of her cooing just wanna impress you while clips of kardashian talking about makeup and yeezy shoes play out (along with the unsettling refrain dont think its working ) ts eerie and stimulating in equal measure picking up on the originals subtle insecurities and taking it somewhere completely unexpected the kind of remix that transcends the format to become something new the other two remixes are by lanzas previous collaborators morgan s take on doesnt have the same spark as their collaboration as the galleria but the skeletal framework puts underneath lanzas track highlights the nuance of her wonderful vocal performance s rework of however does have some magic to it the two footwork producers pad their usual attack to make it sound romantic like a fluttering heartbeat succeeds in showing its source material in a new light

theres something satisfying about this collaboration between and on the one hand you have the grime veteran and on the other one of the pioneers of its spiritual child uk funky their split 12 inch combines all the urgency of grime with the bounce of funky compromising neither along the way s solo track couples bit crushed synths with muscular kicks and incongruously synthesised birdcalls winding down with a sparkling melodic passage quite at odds with the preceding toughness s offering the quasi nostalgic bowsers opens with a sample of super mario winning coins this triumphant sound recurs as were immersed in a flurry of 8 bit melody and bone dry snares it works though you imagine the track would have double the impact at half the length most intriguing is the collaboration deranged bongos flurry alongside dancehall vocals and agitated kicks with raw unrelenting dynamism in contrast shares s hey vocal snippet but is otherwise subtler as barren as its name would suggest it plumps for the kind suspenseful tension and release explored on his dark crawler lp
its nice to hear florian in a contemplative mood not that this is uncommon for him many of his releases balance sheer power with patches of lightness but for the most part articula o his latest lp on is strangely soothing the album begins with a piece featuring text from iranian author and philosopher reza negarestani delivered hypnotically by vocalist joan la barbara over the course of 25 minutes metaphorical imagery is used to discuss notions of nature and culture: a forest and a city are divided by a deep gorge a nimble goat leaps between its inner walls a river with two streams in one flows between them and the sky is somehow everywhere at once takes a fairly literal approach running two opposing discourses in parallel nature in the left channel and culture in the right each touched by subtle uncomfortable warping and distortion the listeners brain constantly switches between the two channels and by extension the states described the text also returns in the records third and final track its treatment here is described in the release notes as the fine time structure of one voice sheathed in the amplitude envelope of another with colliding and reshaping the voices of sugata bose and anna kohler around and through each other the words are still audible but tangled in a highly agitated sonic mesh bridging these two pieces is the 29-minute ( meaningless affectless out of nothing ) placed between two movements with human presence its sprawling mixture of pokerfaced sonic events feels almost animalistic this meaningless affectless modulator is strangely charming even cute in places with moments of rhythm and sound design surprisingly reminiscent of club music neatly folding s most recent conceptual explorations in spoken word into an unpredictable self-referencing package articula o makes for a great listening experience but what makes it particularly striking is that this could be the most colourful and laid back has ever sounded
an all spanish release here from with frank garcia tony vega combining to create the as the name suggests expect some solid dark tribal drums to hit you quite hard in this release first up is the title track africaman starting out with some crisp drum patterns and a cut up vocal the track continues to flow nicely with a dark tribal set of drums and a deep subtle baseline that bubbles beneath the beats very chunky throughout a track like this really would need a big soundsystem to get the full benefits of the big sounds that emerge from this production following this is a technology accapella that features some vocal and drum loop effects first up on the flip is the original mix of technology again this production relies on deep dark tribal sounds as an intense set of drums work quite well with a subtle vocal effect as well as a booming baseline a dark stabbing synth enters the track giving it a grittier edge and making the production on a whole quite dark and dirty another solid outing here by the spanish duo following this is a remix of technology by production outfit afroboogie another pretty solid affair this remix again has quite a chunky tribal feel to it with a nice smooth baseline combining with solid drum patterns and a whole array of sound effects that combine quite nicely for tribal lovers this ep is certainly worth checking out and for those that love solid chunky music then i urge you to do the same there are some solid moments on here that are quite worthy of providing a good moment or two

self-confessed basshead londons v i v e k has worked harder than most to ensure the continued presence of deep and spacious dubstep in the capital on top of releasing a string of largely great eps through malas deep medi hes recently gone one better and built his own soundsystem in response to a lack of decent clubs in which to experience the full physical heft of his music his new system label is named after the club night where his rig resides and this first 12-inch offers suitably sub-loaded fare to match steroids is as vast and cosmic as its name suggests: theres precious little to it save a huge void carved out by a sub-bass drone so deep its practically inaudible on home speakers which leaves space for a few snare hits and percussive bleeps each drowned in reverb and leaving a trail of vapour coasting in its wake is a vocal version of the same track its female narrator drifting forward with eyes open wide through the heart of the gulf where a great deal of purist dubstep now feels frustratingly clean and lacking in the rawness of the genres early days steroid s pulsating subs are forceful enough to induce intense sensations of vertigo elevating it above the majority of v i v e ks contemporaries its easy to hear why he built a custom system to showcase this stuff on though without suitable amplification its a very sparse listen and lacks the immediacy of his earlier releases for deep medi om s remix of seems acutely aware of this he bolsters it with rolling cymbal tics and a springy triplet-led rhythm that appears to run both backwards and forwards at the same time a disorienting counterpart to the originals sensory immersion

the blurb accompanying s ep described it as a much-needed hot beef injection into a dance scene thats become a little too vegan-friendly for our liking i mention this not just because its the sort of over-the-top promo copy that brings a smile to an ra staffers face but because it struck me as straight-up wrong from the moment i started listening yes is a late 90s-era international deejay gigolos signee and the former duo (florian senfter now carries the torch solo) behind the 1999 megahit kernkraft 400 a beefy cv to be certain but as squelchy and grinding as the ep might get at times its commendably well-balanced not vegan exactly but senfter definitely managed to fit an asparagus spear or two on this platter its buzzsaw synths taking no prisoners the title cut comes heaviest but with an uncluttered arrangement built around bouncing organic drums its hardly the heaving mass it could have been melodically abstract and set to a strolling beat is almost confusingly well-behaved a little of that bottled-up tension seeps out on though until it explodes in its final minute or so we get only angry hisses a little overdriven disco sneaks into the interlude-like paving the way for zoo brazils downright nerdy remix sure isnt exactly a light meal but its not likely to raise your cholesterol by more than a blip

when came out of a four-year retirement last year it didnt sound like much had changed back with her regular label scratcha dvas following a spell with diskotopia the london producers sound remains familiar is bright melodic and playful is particularly reminiscent of past glories its digisoul chords and deft swung side sticks suggesting uk garage channeled through the post-dubstep of five years ago there are also echoes of another london style broken beat in its jazzy bounce helped by a vocal from elsewhere fidgets in multiple directions exploring a spread of tempos and feels if you squint at the fractured drums and sour arps of youll hear dubstep lurches up to 150 bpm for a take on footworks chipmunk sample scraps and sharp percussion but it cant quite settle flitting between boisterous 4/4 and awkward stasis finally helps flip the script on the closer its a pensive ambient moment interrupted by strangely forceful chord stabs as if cant help but keep things moving along
brancaccio aisher released everybody on bedrock a few months back it was indeed a dancefloor hit that had many in two minds as the lads revealed through an interview on ra it was a track designed solely for the dancefloor and not designed to be dissected the britt mix on the flip was a quality record that pleased those that didn t think the original was their cup of tea a couple of months later another re-incarnation returns this time with tom mangan on rework duties it s a single side release so the pressure is on for mangan to work his magic the production begins with some solid drums that introduce the original electro melody from the original that have been cleverly effected and warped by mangan the vocal gets a cut up and as the track builds in a funky edge the melody gets further abused as the track turns into a dirty electro affair with effects rife in the production the arrangement is also cleverly conduced as it builds and falls throughout keeping it very interesting tom mangan has provided a very good remix to a production that may have lacked some real substance the king britt mix bettered the original just as this mix has bettered the britt mix but of course it s all opinion based and that was mine i do like this mix and if you liked both mixes of the everybody then you are bound to get great value out of this mix
next up on adam freeland s imprint comes a storming release from new talent aka damian taylor and his production the original mix has a great pulsating flow throughout thanks to some rippling basslines and a haunting set of main riffs some subtle guitar riffs give the track a gritty edge while the broken beats flow tenderly throughout it is a very lively track from damian and its more then a worthy release for the marine imprint the melting ice caps dub is a more dubby affair as the name suggests with some deeper basslines and some more rigorous drums there is still that eerie feel to it with the main riffs as well as some effects late on but the disappointing aspect for me is that it has an all too similar style and as such the end result isn t too dissimilar from the a-side
if you know its probably through his releases as damaskin the alias he uses to make rough and grinding techno for his debut album on however the belgian producer softens up considerably shows him throwing away all that rusty metal to let in the softer sounds of the earth the rustling of vegetation the smooth trickle of running water which combine for an almost celestial loveliness its hard to imagine a record better suited to the woodsy ethos of like a less emotional dominik eulberg this is deeper-than-deep techno shrouded in the damp atmospherics of the rainforest has a way of sounding immense but not overpowering the title track coaxes you in with nine minutes of gorgeous nature sounds and then it hits you: one glorious wash of bliss after another almost every track deals with the same elements: whirring high frequencies slow-rumbling basslines and peppy percussive arrangements each sprawling path has a different way of putting these parts together but theyre always hidden under a canopy of trees creating a thick humid air that only makes the album more enveloping there are differences here and there gestures towards dub techno with its rubbery synth leads while recalls the field in how it squashes everything into one graceful blur but fundamentally is an album that lives solely in its own carefully-defined world the lp is so committed to this dense universe that at times it feels impenetrable nless you really zone out to it might seem a little samey it requires a certain ear for detail to pick apart the intricacies in those flowing layers of sound nlike say segues pacifica maybe the definitive release doesnt do much to keep you entertained once youre deep in the album its about the small details that surface in the deluge like the water droplets in wading through you might feel lost deep in uncharted territory where you know youll have to explore for a long time just to make it back to civilization it takes some commitment but as with a long expedition its the moments of beauty you encounter along the way that make it worth the journey
its fair to say isnt someone im terribly familiar with aside from spotting his name on the odd archipel release (but nevertheless failing to fork out) ive had all but zero contact with his work which is my loss because if this ep is anything to go by hes a very good producer indeed title track is a gorgeous piece of ambling tech house neither prosaically minimal nor superficially deep and about as befitting of its title as is conceivable rolling along at a healthy 127 bpm its got plenty of jack (this is a groover if ever i heard one) but its also beguilingly calm blessed with a kind of inner stillness that places it at a considerable remove to the majority of club-oriented summer fodder currently clogging up beatports virtual aisles built out of muffled kicks skittering hats fuzzy bass and bittersweet melodies (not to mention some wonderfully visceral bursts of static) its a texturally rich and structurally lucid piece of music each part seemingly at ease with itself and its surroundings and laced with a kind of wide-eyed innocence thats all too frequently lost in todays hyperactive market over on the flip (this is a digital-only release) label boss lets takes things in a tougher more metallic direction wringing out the originals boozy swagger and replacing it with an ice cold 4/4 snap the likes of which radio slave so successfully trades in it works a treat the thing fairly gallops along and makes for a perfect tonic to the a-sides meandering charms

if you had to send an electronica-loving tourist just touched down at heathrow in the direction of what sums up the sound of london now youd do no worse then point them in the direction of with releases on aus and man make music the all-encompassing eclectic sound of fitzgerald has found its most regular home on scubas hotflush if youre not already familiar with from scubas dj-kicks it inhabits the hinterland between uk garage deep house and dubstep not too far from the borders from techno could have been a mess in most hands but in the best traditions of brit cross-hybridising fitzgerald stitches it together seamlessly trippy synth swells weave in and out a single repetitive note beeps away amid spattering handclaps before a breakdown that takes you to the edge and leaves you there adopts a more classic uk garage feel with plonking tuff jam keys harnessing it to snapping techno drums and with dubsteppy vocal snatches dropped over it eventually heading towards a super-emotive denouement in doesnt quite set the pulses racing like its ep siblings but theres no shame in dropping the pace down a notch stead amid scrunched-up almost tranceyish analogue synths and finger clicks fitzgerald allows himself the space to experiment with some complex tribalish drum patterns this is the sound of a producer whos in the zone
if a recent twitter post is anything to go by paul rose k is only too aware that the dubstep/techno honeymoon has (finally) run its course not that he seems to care: this is his most techno-minded 12-inch to date -side is so thoroughly entrenched in both camps and a good many others in fact that talk of genres seems spurious this is simply club music and good club music at that picking up where his largely overlooked (and wonderful) tense left off it maintains a throbbing rhythmic trajectory but trades that tracks rubbery synthetic unity for a more disparate approach to sonic assemblage comprised of bleary organ-like synth pads bubbly sub-aquatic pops and crackles and periodic disembodied bursts of what sounds like kevin saundersons good life it exists in a murky strangely colourless historical interzone neither reverent nor celebratory but rather frozen and neutral as if locked in cryogenic stasis granted it doesnt quite gel something somewhere is missing but as an exercise in sonic collage its both audacious and compelling meanwhile -side sees rose enter unbridled 4/4 territory with a nigh on textbook instantiation of the erghain/ostgut sheet metal school of techno what he takes from his dubstep background is a healthy sense of swing inhering this in a tightly packed but largely uneventful seven-minute stomp all icy blasts of noise and squelchy clods of bass up there with the sparest of dettmanns or klocks its a bloody-minded piece of dance floor minimalism that mixed appropriately will wreak havoc with early-morning clubbers waning minds nd theres not much the detractors can say to that now is there
theres a point on where a man expresses his surprise at the sounds koalas make and hes followed by a burst of noises you wont want to hear if youre feeling queasy i too experienced surprise at the sounds made by this particular koala who follows up his debut album the carpal tunnel syndrome with a surprisingly warm tender record hilarious in places and introspective in others using the turntable as a melodic instrument in old time music such as basin street blues its clear that a lot of thought and skill has gone into this theres no showboating on the scratching front either - if it aint musical its not included that even applies to flu season a sound picture of two virus-ridden djs meeting in the middle of a street - as funny as it sounds koala occasionally plays piano such as on space cadet 2 and theres a snippet from one of his most loved comic characters grandmaphone more dance music implores you to learn to shake your ass and the closing vacation island is warmly romantic grandmaphone and negatron appear in the accompanying book s comic in black and white illustration like the music its funny tender and painstakingly achieved
in retrospect was always going to end up in ibiza head of the -loving label and a purveyor of chilled electronic music since the 90s he surely felt the pull of the white isle long before he arrived there now hes made it his home barrotts productions have entered a fruitful new phase laced with hazy synths and field recordings from idyllic locations the sketches from n island series is top-drawer from an artist whos been circling the style for years barrotts latest diverts from that series but only really in name the choice of sounds is a touch less kitschy but the blissed-out mood remains undisturbed b-side suggests barrotts still taking inspiration from his new home the title first calls to mind cans 1971 lp (theres a healthy dose of kosmische in barrotts music) but its also the name of an island resort just off ibizas coast the track is pleasantly aimless its bouncy conga lines string and wind patches and bass guitar licks dancing around one another with lazy grace the effect is colourful and chaotic not unlike the chorus of birdcall barrott leaves running in the background is more reclined dive-bombing leads and dusty arps tumble over each other slowly while a light hi-hat and the odd tom take up the pulse we never get to a full beat though no need to go anywhere when youre already home
curvve recordings has shown top form since its first release and this their forth outing follows up the hands in the air drama queen from steve porter which is originally a vocal/guitar piece from michael simone is the first single of the upcoming album from lovesky and here we see an all star line-up take on remix duties first up is wally lopez who puts his stamp on things with the usual jacked-up house mix complete with rumbling beats heavy bassline and tweaked growling stabs that keep up the pace while the originals vocal and swirling melodies filter in and out adding a sublime edge to the angry groove next up is chris fortier who takes it in a deeper direction using atmospheric chords and chunky rolling percussion along with the vocal all the time an uplifting mood floats underneath with subtle piano chords and light pads that ease the pace along lifting gently in places with a more cut up vocal bringing the melody to the fore and taking it a notch darker with pulsating synth stab and heavily reverbed vocal for the last remix its the job of label boss vinny troia who turns out an impressive take with a peaktime prog blend of energetic synthlines and airy sweeps that are made dreamier with long delayed sounds and that smooth vocal that takes the centre stage as the track peels back before powering ahead again all the right elements are in place and the emotive changes in melody make for alot of smiles across the dancefloor track four is the original from lovesky who continues to think outside of the box and create interesting and inventive sounds melding genres together with ease and showing his experimental approach to creating music
you can tell immediately why recorded during the sessions for midtown 120 blues was a favourite of label boss toshiya kawasaki and why it also had to be left off the album the tune bangs (as much as a sprinkles tune can bang) in a way that little else does on midtown 120 blues a true master jackathon run through the unique sprinkles filter fitted with an ear-piercing bit of melody that drops in every so often to remind you of its producer it pumps along in an understated manner leaving plenty of room for bird noise a thunder storm and a choir to make their way into the mix at one point or another sprinkles pulls it all together but its hard to know how: its a rare talent that can make a track this remarkably complex and danceable at the same time a bonus beat and dub fill out the package before kink do what they do best to the original taking things back 20 years for an unabashedly old school remix the duos work often flits between excellent homage and unnecessary retread and this remake falls somewhere in between: it strips the original of everything that made it enticing to home listeners but it also makes it dance floor dynamite you wont find much surprising about the string-laden mini-epic but you also might be master jacking too much to care
we are all americans now sings on from her new album she doesnt mean it as a compliment at the end of two disappointing terms as the us deals with its shrinking global influence and toxic domestic politics the former leader of antony johnsons is asking where it all went wrong she itemises the countrys wrongs drone warfare state surveillance capital punishment a blindness towards climate change and suggests that much of the world is following the uss destructive lead ts clearly a heartfelt view and most people who consider themselves left wing would share it so where does go wrong not with the music itself whose glittering surfaces are a pleasure to the ears has swapped her usual chamber-pop for a brace of beats from hudson mohawke and oneohtrix point never both producers are skilled at bringing mainstream and leftfield together and hudmo in particular is on brilliant form music is grand euphoric and gaudily synthetic and s celestial warble sounds as comfortable in its new home as it did 11 years ago on am a bird now style shift is tactical: the music is a trojan horse to smuggle in the political message and its the message thats the problem trojan horse analogy suggests something sneaky and concealed n fact s views are often so bluntly expressed that they block out everything else her main lyrical mode is sledgehammer irony as on the triple threat of about capital punishment ( have no mercy on me / please have no mercy ); directed at the nsa ( know you love me / cause youre always watching me ); and a reference to this centurys predicted rise in global temperature ( wanna see this world wanna see it boil ) saying the exact opposite of what you think is only slightly more interesting than just saying what you think on repeat listens it begins to seem less so joked in one interview that she wrote the albums lyrics in three minutes and her passionate views are often undermined by the way theyre expressed album is full of clunky non-rhymes and tortuous wordings includes the line case m involved in child molesters an ugly contortion to fit a stiff lyric scheme much of is spent with long melismatic repetitions of the potuss name surely there are more effective ways to have a go at him se details are aggravating because behind them you can sometimes glimpse the brilliant album might have been biggest hint is earth an environmentalists lament over a hudmo beat bursting with romanticism slips into a more poetic style and words and music suddenly mesh good pop is often pliable its message broad or ambiguous enough for listeners to flex it to their taste political pop can be like this without compromising its message but most of has no interest in pliability t regards its audience as either fervent believers in s cause or a pop mass in need of blunt polemic we might all be americans but were not that homogenous
tracks have a tendency to undermine good ideas with lazy deep house tropes has a crushing techno groove its kicks and hats ringing in chasmic space but any interest evaporates under the scorching blast of a jazzy guitar and a vocal loop that may as well have deep samples vol iv stamped on it s sample is also poorly considered mf dooms rendition of william saroyans poem a word of advice was stirring when it opened doomilation but here the disconnect between its depth and the tracks flippant if rump-shaking groove only draws attention to the clich of throwing a spoken word vocal on a house track a tired shorthand for profundity collaborations fare slightly better which features tarri is strongest when the pair dials back on the dusty funk loops (complete with vinyl crackle) and instead let a neatly engineered drum pattern play out unadorned and which sees hook up with long-time producer the is by some distance the eps strongest moment (if you can get over the vocal baubles) with a lithe low-end that bubbles beneath reverb-soaked piano music neednt be smart but is let down by a willingness to follow the most obvious path
epic is a word overused in a lot of circles music reviews not least among them it would be churlish to begrudge and his new track that very description however to my mind at least s earns it first and most obviously of all theres the length for a lot of producers especially those who operate within the house or techno spheres creating a 14-minute track is a sure sign of one of two things; overindulgence or hopeless naivete neither is the case here s seems to evaporate faster than the fleeting scent of an ex-flames perfume and leaves just as powerful of a melancholic impression in the minutes that follow kicking things off with a simple yet strikingly beautiful chord progression it makes its way through metallic clanks off-key percussion and sharp toms with the kick finally relieving the pressure some three minutes in nd then come the strings: sparingly flicks them in and out of the arrangement underplaying what could have overwhelmed in the hands of a less subtle producer has been responsible for some of the most considered and emotional dance music of recent years this track somehow primal and yet exceptionally delicate is an extended snapshot of him at his thought-provoking best
next up on bedrock comes an ep from a very promising talent in 4 tracks are featured and you can expect the usual quality that you normally find in each bedrock release present here as well you wanna do what is first up and it starts the ep in a very moody way with some driving beats that are accompanied nicely with some subtle synths that build nicely for the first few minutes before they are joined by some soothing melodies and a smooth breakdown the track then comes into life with some rumbling baselines and a heavy presence of strong sounds in one hand is a bit smoother and one thing that is noticeable are how crisp the beats and baselines are again there is a strong atmosphere in the track that builds as the track progresses and again the track really builds and takes off after the first few minutes and once the nice melodic patterns are introduced a very good first disc to a pretty impressive debut ep by derek on bedrock
and hauke have put out records together for years s good-time disco-house sound cant escape comparison to their partnership as session victim which will suit most fans just fine and mine a particular house sound: generous with samples festooned in funk and soul a little worn-in one of two tracks here plants earthy double bass scrapyard percussion and tart synth chords onto a cut-and-paste house track s solo work some of which features on giegling edges into sombre moods and theres an echo of that on s contribution loops elastic guitar funk and a deep bassline into a taut disco-house bomb exactly the sort of thing session victim excel at it doesnt have the gently anthemic feel of say 2014s never forget but its understated charisma is typical of the duos catalogue s is the standout a track that sounds like a treasure found after a day of digging in second-hand record bins stratocaster guitar whistles and a cabaret-ish vocal put the music somewhere between dick dales surf rock and 99 records offbeat disco
butchs output is both astonishingly prolific and varied some of his recent work like lullabies to paralyze on visionquest or songs about unconsciousness from earlier this year touched on neo-trance sounds with aplomb that said id wager most people associate b lent g rler with his trackier-than-tracky hits like no worries or drummers drama tunes made with the least amount of elements that are looped for as long as possible he works in that spirit on his first release for seth troxlers label but not only does it feel like a step backwards after a strong run of singles its an uninspired example of the simplest trick up g rlers sleeve is the epitome of butch: a tribal loop repeats and repeats until the rhythm is burned into your brain while weird sounds nature and crowd chatter in this case fill out the background res a huge eruption of cheers and clapping around the midpoint before the loop snaps back into place and continues to its unsatisfying conclusion at least is warm funky and a little hypnotic but is flat-out cheesy a funk break bathed in reverb with a preacher sample it sounds like something youd hear in a trendy fusion restaurant ten years ago is a decent tool to play underneath something else; on the other hand is too distracting to even work on that level
r s has had a new split personality since its late 00s renaissance half techno/bass and half indie electronica the label is defined as much by floor-fillers as it is by the drifting serenity of cloud boat and the latter trio hail from london and represent the somber side of the labels sound though their earlier work had traces of uk garage s debut lp has a different mission it would be easy to write a house record at this time everyone would rave about it frontman lewis rainsbury explained in a recent interview but to me that hasnt got as much longevity as a real record then is the trios attempt to make a real record it has all the breathing passages plaintive intermissions and careful sequencing that define so many indie albums but it seems that in their quest for dignity lost what makes them interesting lands somewhere between james blake and the recent wave of indie pop groups like diiv rainsburys eminently british voice its mellifluous cadences and occasional electronic manipulation is pure blake especially on vocal-driven tracks like and and like the sketch-style songs of the uk star rainsnburys melodies feel half-finished and mumbled its not a bad effect but set against the bands tepid languor it washes over in a wave of grey have their moments: (which dates back to 2010) proves they can write a pop song and here the bands softly brushed drums and liquid guitar strokes contribute to a lovely ebb and flow that persists through the whole album but that set-adrift feeling gets tiresome and on a track like with its slow drum hits and barely-there vocal you just wish it would finally take off and do something it never does the band swim their way through the sleepy-eyed balladry of the title track and attempt to make touching plastic soul with whats most striking is how thoroughly theyve scrubbed their sound of its dance influences with garage only a vague hint in some of the beats late in the album a sampled voice on stands out like phosphorescence in their dreary ocean a simple phrase thats at once more soulful and emotive than anything else here with its rich organ sounds and plaintive guitar it channels the summer nostalgia of beach house and adds some much needed variety but is not an album of movement its stationary and while it might be beautiful to gaze at momentarily by the end of the record its treading water

one cannot expect inspiration to come easy every day seminal micro-house producer marc leclair k told r in 2011 there are moments you have to lay back and observe whats been accomplished if you wish to move forward with a formidable catalogue of music including notable releases on perlon as horror inc leclair is well established in the vanguard of canadas minimal scene with abstract minimal-leaning sounds recently making a comeback now feels like an apt moment for leclair to resurface juxtaposes giddy keyboard plinks with dark brooding pads tame vocal cuts in unnecessarily but an unexpected keyboard solo regroups the piece conforming to more conventional house characteristics filled with infectious choppy samples sounds the most identifiably begins poised as an 8-bit trip before abruptly bopping into a weird boogie in leclairs typically playful style the standout is which moves through swooning strings that are soon joined by giddy blips deep bells and precise two-step percussion
s best records build up ridiculous degrees of tension tracks like amor fati and flashback have almost laughably large drops catchy melodies and interesting textures are also part of the formula but ultimately these tunes are grenades you pull the pin and duck for cover they helped send into the upper echelons of bristol techno and after multiple releases on s sub-label and collaborations with randomer peder mannerfelt and peverelist is his first solo release on proper the title track mixes rolling hand drums with bird-call zaps humid delays and the odd animalistic whoop continuing s penchant for tropical sounds the tinny lead line is classic as is the breakdown in the back third were in his sweet spot and destruction ensues but its also nothing we havent heard from him before the same could be said of the b-side could detonate the dance with delayed vocals a rising melody and a throbbing sub whose pitch changes key to great effect it fits neatly into the lineage of records that made his name reusing familiar ideas that are remarkably effective in the mix the plus-size weapons on will cause damage but i wouldnt be surprised if made these tracks three years ago hes capable of writing with surprising sensitivity this 12-inch for all its underground nous is for big rooms
lthough it may have dropped at start of summer this 12-inch more than deserves a review now not only for its all-out quality but also as a timely reminder of imminent release of s double cd set bro rhood the three cuts here remix tracks from two previous releases ba lon fall collection mini-album and enigmatic which has already seen an echospace reduction is a collaboration between pablo bolivar dub techno veteran and sergio phro a graphic designer and former vocalist with reggae groups better collie and loud and lone their unique take on dub techno is here lured over threshold into three completely distinct territories with striking results sven weisemann opens release with a side-long minimal percussive workout of its some of his best work to date almost magically little bongo runs and rim shots fill out dark cavernous dub spaces with a velvety opulence phros plaintive vocals weave in and out to form melodic shadows as polyrhythms accumulate and break down in haunting waves over a forceful and driving bass pressure in stark contrast to weisemanns more sublime offering is more up-front deep house workout of z richs soultourist collective (this time attributed to philippe w ger ron shiller and tobi schweizer) its immediately more present not just for bigger sounds but also for sly working of snares and hi-hats that add infinite angles and possibilities to sense of movement and make it not only a highly danceable track but one for deep listening madrid duo bove (javier lvarez) and man (jos uel lvarez) round things off with a progressive interpretation of that somehow encapsulates whole set their mix seems at first a nebulous dub techno soundscape until it fills out with hypnotic tribal house percussion and more of phros vocal calls beautiful and danceable it seems to be perfect link between o r two mixes overall unmissable
david hofmann and till gerloffs debut is well-timed their retro disco sound has the same tropes as daft punks random access memories from the basslines right down to the vocoders (not to mention the lengthy runtimes) ut where the french group were trying to replicate the 70s records they loved d rerstuben approach the same aesthetic with nu discos computer-aided lustre makes a good feint its trip-hop-y full of broken beats and smeared vocals until it stumbles into a warm shuffle with alearic guitars and iridescent keyboards g-funk synth lines add to the stargazing quality making for a meaty eight-minute epic with just enough twists and turns to keep your attention on the other hand could be the soundtrack to some travel agency commercial its likeable with slippery synths and pools of reverb but it feels like an exercise in by-the-numbers boogie evoking the same beachside miami vice vibes freiherr is a little more successful bolstering the funky formula with more hooky vocoders d rerstuben have the chops to make some seriously silky stuff but shows that theyll need more than just satin to make a lasting impression
fun its an essential component of all dance music from the sleaziest disco the deepest house the ughest techno you can have serious brooding tracks sure but every set needs a splash of silly genius brighten things up a track turn your mates wag your finger round like a goon and pull a grimace like a yawning sea lion while screaming your lungs silly and the rothers schwarz are renowned purveyors of such joyous delirium go guys for trusty disco weapons when theyve focused their production craft away from the serious side of techno and house theyve spawned absolute classics with that in mind this all star release from the album should be a belter right sadly no nd it certainly isnt fun production wise it sounds more like lef vers from a techno banquet devoured and left long ago s slew of poker flat releases and dry as dust style made him technos pin up boy for a stretch and s contrast between his campy prancing pony dj sets and pumping linear techno cuts has proven a winning formula together theyre an unpredictable duo with tracks ranging from plodding drivel sweaty masterpieces ut compared the brilliant lbertino sounds as stale and thin as it does dry and hollow s trademark percussion dominates from the outset and with no real shift in mood or tempo bar vocalist florian schirmachers villalobosian vocal posturing you begin glaze over by the latter third usually merchants of outrageous twists and turns cavernous breakdowns and slippery funk and just seem content get this one off their chest have turned their deft uch just about every kind of house music this decade has thrown about from deep electro tech minimal which makes it all the more curious that sounds so formulaic with reverb ridden bell chimes and a horrible yamaha sounding synth riff riding awkwardly over crisp drums and random hand claps it sounds lazy and devoid of warmth and invention its not that is bad its just that like the and galuzzi track it breezes past like techno tumbleweed
weve been nattering on at r about for a while now and its easy to hear why: if you hear a track by the group in a dj set it sticks out like a sore thumb of jazzy house emphasis on jazzy the group plays live in the studio and sounds live on record warts bum notes a bit of water in the mixing desk you hear it all in s tunes in a manner similar to kalabrese whose recording philosophy also welcomes the element of chance kings doesnt have much chance to it though its has a loose but unrelenting groove that sits at a regular tempo its a careful balance mixing improvisatory guitar lines a piano that plays around in its cordoned-off chord cluster and a saxophone that flies in from above to say hello but are basically a solid jazz act that doesnt mind sticking to a 4/4 beat ( good thing for us ) ricardo turns up on the -side for a rework of the original that surpisingly doesnt do a lot the celebrated producer strips out much of the middle of the track focusing the groove more intently its a true re mix in that there isnt much added only things pushed up or down to make it even more suitable for the dance floor and ends up making it sound a little bit like what cadenza was doing in its earliest days what dance floors this will star on of course is anyones guess ut let me know when you hear it ill be there
ras nick connellan described phillip lauers debut album earlier this year as yacht rock house if the frankfurt producers remix of s is anything to go by the yacht is now moored somewhere off benirras circa 1999 atop deep resonant bass keys not a million knots away from gat decor s passion in fact lauer interlaces a dizzying stream of twinkling synth melodies and frothy percussion keeping the right side of kitsch it ends up sounding like a million dollars meanwhile wesley has made a (quiet) name for himself with releases on border community and more recently studio barnhus the young welshmans opening take on combines sweeping boards of canada-style leftfield analogue-isms with a deep tech lushness its some radiantly beautiful smart future techno the mix shows another side to mixing up 8-bit tronics with almost imperceptible early electro undertones and a three-quarters speed uk garage riddim
re is a photograph being used to promote presumably an outtake from the booklet that comes with the cd that shows running through a forest she has antlers on her head and is looking back if not in fear then apprehensively its a mysterious image open to numerous interpretations and one that visually represents her new music with a rare accuracy se 16 pieces are transmissions from that state between sleep and wakefulness when your dreams take on a particularly vivid and outrageous quality sometimes they bolt you awake in a feverish panic sometimes you drift on in delicious languor more often those dreams simply tantalise you y are elusive indecipherable and all the more compelling for their ambiguity this is the tone of and the astonishing are cosmic adventures in synth loops that fuse elements of pole classic and fittingly tangerine dream slow elegant and radiantly melodic these tracks are shot through with a deep sadness followed by the fraught choral drama of from forms a high-watermark of emotion which builds to and recedes away from holding your attention through stylistic ebb and flow res a stark awesome beauty to the glitchy nuclear winter of nd t and the beatless dub techno of nd and nd hint at grotty dance floor techno without committing elsewhere rush dips into leftfield electronic pop the vocal tracks and are reminiscent of emikas conservatoire club ballads and on techno-mutated dub reggae morphous as it is state is a very solid body of work

may be best known for noisy post-industrial rock but guided by the curatorial hand of owner powell craig clouse proves that he can do dance music thats just as tough the same rich vein of funk that gives powells releases their sensuous throb courses through s self-titled debut for diagonal its present in the relentless bassline of ; its in the syncopated backbone of ; and it simmers under a cluster of textured rhythms on the signature tangles of noise are as present as ever but theyre more restrained than on previous records s snatches of vocal and piano sustained high tones and light-touch distortion make for something throbbing rather than explosive while s drum-machine thumps and wiry synths are reined in by the inexorable groove is the highlight a scuffed post-punky track with a lumbering drum-led groove and compacted vocal samples its synths sound charred and the drums are brittle but its all anchored by a meaty bassline is the biggest curveball channeling strands of house noise and post-punk into something both alien and utterly compelling

what is it about good house music that evokes a sense that summer isnt too far away its still only spring but already our thoughts are already months ahead tripping out on sunshine and dope beats its in this spirit that ive been giving the latest freerange colour series comp repeated plays on my new wharfedales like previous episodes green 04 is bumpy bassline action in an urban house vernacular solid get things started with a remix of s don t let the girly wail fool you this track is tough the polar opposite of s solo offering an introspective cut that seems to have wandered in off the street onto the tracklist freerange boss himself features twice getting some b off his as with a detroit influenced cut so deep i almost drowned in its tones before flipping the coin with a dancefloor muscle flexing remix for san franciscos justin drops a dirty bomb with while fellow yank s bugs along like something from a derrick carter set elsewhere theres an exclusive new hottie from dubby sounds from as well as more tried and tested deep house from the closest thing to funky house of yore on this cd all of the above amounts to something worth parting with your hard earned for but its the inclusion of two tracks that really makes this a keeper belgian outfit spirit turn in a magnificent acid tinged and sun soaked version of s starchaser that truly captures a summer day spent watching jets streaming across the sky icing on the cake is the beautiful from carl finlow which reminds us that feeling blue also deserves an appropriate soundtrack green 04 points to why and his label have become part of the staple diet of many house afficionados along with buzzin fly freerange is spearheading the fresh house sound coming out of london and the uk dedicated followers know that good house music never dies and that talk of revivals are idle gossip blowing around the yard like loose leaves those who like it deep should beg steal borrow or even better buy this

marseilles aka fr d ric berthet has lately become known for his many excellent disco edits for french label biomix his first release on jay shepheards is all his own work though the guiding hand old disco is still at the fore bolts a jacking disco groove onto a motown-style vocal lamenting the pressures workin two jobs til youre almost dead resulting in a very solid slice summer dance floor material mic s remix adds some deep bass synths and flashing effects to the mix bringing forth a more synthetic hypnotic quality of is more soaring pairing gently ascending pads and a forceful beat with another infectious vocal lays a spanish-language vocal over gentle hi-hats for an altogether more meditative end- -the-party experience but berthets real skill lies in bold disco cuts something thats clear to see on
its true that hasnt shied from the glitch the drone or the odd skipping disc even so his recordings have long offered refuge to traceable tactile sounds whether looped field recordings fragmented vocals or live incorporation of traditional instruments there are usually at least a couple of clear discernible elements amidst the gauze of process s such it probably wont surprise anyone whos tracked deuprees course over the past decade to learn that hes just released an all-acoustic record it all began on a particularly cold and rainy winter day deupree explains in a candid label statement (candid because he also admits to having a cat named pixel ) reaching for a guitar some looping pedals and a handful of other instruments he set out to distill that familiar balance of warm insular indoors and a damp dreary outdoors it was either that or knit a scarf is a creaking wheel of wispy drones melancholy piano murmuring voices and scratchy artifacts bsent almost post-rock guitar appears at the midpoint breaking up the static nature of the loops while inviting still deeper reverie is built from similar components but has a cozier more cottony quality theres a touch of the familiar too with a looped bit of guitar recalling music for irports and a recurring guitar warm-up that seems a direct reference to talk talks scension day (the resemblances may be coincidental but the ancestrys certain ) in addition to housing deuprees first all-acoustic tracks also marks the first vinyl product of s twelve-year history inaugurating a new 7-inch line the new sounds and new format take to one another swimmingly the recordings practically painting a still-life of weathered worn old 45s nd yet id have liked a little more engaging of the limits imposed and opportunities afforded by this format the matter of length in particular confined to four minutes the music pleads for a little more time the vinyl attempts to alleviate this with run-out grooves on each side but theres still a sense of unfinished business perhaps a concession to the brevity issue a digital bonus track gets it exactly right 23-minute slowed-down work-over of clears some elbow room to fully capitalize on an even sleepier pattern of repetition featuring more prominent post-recording treatments its fittingly dubbed the still mix and draws a straighter line connecting these new works to back catalog highlights like stil : it revisits the tricks his fans came to love but still asserts a continued interest in more organic directions

might not have the cachet of some of uk techno peers but if hes going to have a coming-out party this ep is it its the first release on dj deeps recently re-launched label and there arent many tracks better suited for making the transition from the old label to the new than its got an athletic stride that almost makes it house but its sputters and sleek chords are pure techno peaktime business with few moments at anything less than full throttle highlight is as creepy as its title driven by a demented wheeze that sounds lifted out of a horror movie taps into the hardcore territory favoured by artists like tessela but instead of uprooting the track the creaky amen snippets ride along like faint memories of some other record with these elements firmly under the thumb of the straight 4/4 beat you could clock it as either clever or underwhelming ep wraps up with a smooth workout with a palpitating chord like most of the ep it might not expand your mind but its done with such an attractive swagger that its hard not to look at in a whole new light
are a new label on to the scene and they unleash their first release by the name of a production from the studio of beaumont pres elevon the original is first up and it is quite a smooth progressive number thanks to some deep baselines a quirky and enticing melodic pattern and an array of sounds and effects the track has quite a good arrangement that is not conventional and it keeps the production interesting throughout the verdict is a solid progressive production that is quite minimal but enticing simultaneously the arfloteba mix on the flip keeps many of the original moments in tact such as the baseline and surrounding eerie effects the track though does use a different baseline patterns midway in and takes it through a dirtier route later on making this quite a solid remix not a bad way to kick start a label with a release that is pretty interesting throughout
i cant tell you a lot about sw or they might be from norway and its possible they have a loose affiliation to the sex tags mania crew whats made clear on this inch though is that they know left field deep house and they know it well the first release on this label also by the duo contained four lo fi workouts that barely reached 0bpm this ep ups the tempo but keeps the same recorded on a cassette aesthetic the sonic palette used by both sw and is one weve heard before; dusty machines chugging away spitting out thick lows and crunchy percussion the style of the tracks has its roots in classic chi town but takes a detour via the (northern) european avant garde from the drunken stumbling break on s to the gossamer twinkles that juxtapose the funk bass lick on sws effort of the same name sued are giving us plenty of reasons to want to find out more
last years ad ack / vomee single came with the briefest of bios ll we know is that its creators were two well-known producers with some history with planet e the latter made it onto sven v ths latest end of season cocoon mix cd s second trip out doesnt quite have the magnetic pull of its predecessor but theres still more energy here than a ton of sodium dropped into a duck pond combining window-rattling jacking techno with a soup on of tribal stylings youll have some fun asking a dj for the lead track at your finest late night musical emporium if they greet you with a cheeky wink itll either be for salacious reasons or because they know that has a devastating 1-2-3 punch drawled female vocal and frequent rmenian duduk samples combine to add shape to the road drill thud of a bassline that seems to have been recorded in 100 metres of deep inky water in contrast revels in a classic trax-y vibe tenaglia-style percussive bash and crashes cosmic wooshes and even speak spell samples fill it all out think the pared back retro approach of levon vincent and youre most of the way there
has a habit of commissioning unusual work from its artists judging from the monad series and the stellate ambient box sets label boss lucy loves a good concept his new project with veteran techno head speedy j is one of the labels best yet loosely translated as synchronizer s self-titled album shows the two producers freed of dance floor considerations and building some of the most challenging music of their careers though it doesnt cater to the dance floor still uses the tools and textures of techno sometimes it feels like the duo have unscrewed all the joints and let the pieces fall in uneven patterns ( ) elsewhere its as if theyve put techno under a microscope and let us see the individual pieces work in painstaking detail an array of dots and squiggles in constant but almost imperceptible motion the albums first few tracks are short and exploratory playing with huge hunks of bass ( ) or sickly gasps ( ) before the lp collects itself into something more closely resembling beats eerie melodies in the vein of alva noto pass in and out but feel conspicuously out of reach a faint glimpse of musicality amidst all the processing longer numbers like could conceivably work in a club but even then the beats are more rigorous than alluring like youre supposed to admire the imposing architecture from a distance rather than dance to it is the records biggest contradiction and its most gripping track: the hissing granular rhythm is intercepted by what sounds like an airplane crashing through steel mesh each and every time the effect is startling even if it isnt dance music is dynamic and physical another missive of cerebral body music from a label that can combine techno and the avant-garde more seamlessly than most
re are few better ways to promote your second single than to grab a feature in new york times but something tells me that will find a way to top it once their third release comes around this is after all a duo that has played with p diddy at wmc and been mentored by dance music heavyweight dennis ferrer that last point is key here as would be nothing without the music to back the press up and thats exactly what theyve done here a collaboration with rgy follows in the minimal mold of my rendition but burrows even deeper bomb of a track it utilizes the ever popular art of sampling voices for their melodic effect dueling two of them over a door slam beat far from the classic house sounds you might expect from their djing are forward looking in their productions grafting soft deep house vocal fillips onto this tech house template much has been made of the supposed help that the had from ferrer on their first single and the rgy collaboration will give further ammunition to the haters hopefully though those that suspect foul play will give wheres mr rown a spin as its just as solid as if not quite as anthemic its a dj tool first and foremost but its one that has enough personality in its syncopated rhythm and dubby chords to reach beyond the designation while its still too early to say remember these guys only have three and a half tracks to their name seem to have a bright future ahead of them

the arrival of another vinyl-only house / techno label is so common these days that its barely news meaning that a solid debut release is more important than ever luckily thats exactly the case with the label born from the london club night streets of beige its first release a chicago-worshipping 12-inch to be filed next to legowelt john heckle and beautiful swimmers is also the debut of berlin producer though the drum machine groove and slick funk bassline on hardly break new ground theyre perfectly enjoyable particularly coupled with a willfully retro synth melody and thrumming snares willie burns of l i e s and cr me organization remixes transforming the original into something dusty and funkily robotic despite its luxurious unfolding into a warm deep house track at just under eight minutes is a little too long and the trite vocal sample detracts from the gorgeously uplifting string loop and synth melody s is s real winner all sun-streaked pads and percussion that pops with little jangling chimes scattered on top its all so summery that its sparse ending a lonely drum hit comes as something of a surprise
s story is a familiar one by now: american experimental artist discovers dance music and changes his tune n ryan mcryhews case it was a brief stint in chicago that got things started the result is an album that shows an experienced synth wiz channeling a style of dance music indigenous to his adopted home: footwork where mcryhews earlier work sounded like someone trying out the style the first time s first full length slims it down and focuses on the basics is retro futurist music that could soundtrack an old computer game all analogue beats can end up stodgy in the wrong hands but here mcryhew is nearly virtuosic juggling drum sounds and twisting synth leads into winding melodies his chord progressions have an emotive quality offsetting the albums bleeps and bloops with downcast moments like the recondite esque part footwork presents itself in spirit more than in execution only a few of the tracks like the hyperactive part reach 160 bpm and the playful drum programming ( part ) could just as easily point back to trax in its heyday n fact with a 4/4 pulse present in some form for most of the lp has a distinct techno influence part could be an stl tune with its dub touches and wobbly effects and part has all the filtered chords youd expect from a peak time club bomb (despite the noisy crescendo at the end) that technoid quality is also potentially the albums downfall is so seamless and consistent that it might grow tedious for less patient listeners ts a collection of live jams at its heart melodies tend to spiral outward rather than take a straight path and the only real production flourish is the big room reverb that dramatically highlights certain chords or drum hits but that skeletal approach is part of the charm: more than just another producer trying out footwork mcryhew shapes his influences into something individual
return with a debut release by dallas producers jv red eye is the track and it features two mises by the duo as well as a dj tool the original mix begins with some deep tribal influenced drums that build for the first few minutes until the deep and echoed vocals of apolesse give the track its eerie character it remains pretty deep and dark for the remainder with some clever drum patterns and effects the dub mix for me loses some of the good elements of the original mix opting for a different drum pattern which doesn t have the quirkiness of the original the vocals are of course lost and for me the dub really lacks essence the release also features an accapella not a bad release by any stretch but for me it lacks a certain essence that will make it memorable the original mix is easily the highlight and would surely work on a dark underground dance floor lurking for some deeper beats

his most recent ep for will sauls label had a tougher sound than wed heard before but finds ewan smith melting back into the kind of emotive moods that characterised his earlier work rooms has a distinctly classic feel rough-hewn kicks square off against grand muffled pads with whispering hi-hats falling across it like early autumn leaves if its a beautiful synthesis of overt and subtle melodies veers towards the latter approach its bedrock a single sustained note providing a firm foundation for jagged bass attacks and arctic-raw percussion is every bit as emotionally-wrought but smith offers a different take on his classically-inclined approach forging deep house with the bubble of acid jazzy inflections and a soulful vocal sample its elegantly quirky something that marquis smartly leaves well alone on his skippy reworking with its overtones of mid-90s todd terry you could call lazy house music in this instance that would be a compliment
released in 2012 s set a high-water mark for the flood of instrumental grime that was to come in a scene where producers compete to make their grooves ever more fractured the belfast artists debut pretty much topped them all without losing an ounce of grimes punch and immediacy the track is re-released here to celebrate the fifth anniversary of mr mitchs gobstopper label and it remains as eyebrow-scorching as ever less can be said of the accompanying whose additions yet more idm scree and yawning mid-bar silences increase the sense of dislocation without upping the shock factor rabits remix is similarly disappointing its a mess actually: whether by design or dodgy mastering its distorted drum barrage is almost unlistenably muddy in the search for ever bolder forms not all paths are fruitful

tayo is set to release the third installment of breaks beats bobz cd and let me be the first (hopefully) to say that it is one stormer of a breaks mix ragga vocals dub infused bass and dancehall beats all fused together with todays breakbeat styles and production methods the 12 vinyl sampler features a new joint by tayo vs precision cuts and also a brand spanking new remix of a jean jacque smoothie tune side a tayo vs precision cuts - girl for those who are familiar with tayo precision cuts productions will recognise the deep ragga breaks laced throughout the track girl features crisp rolling beats scratched up ragga vocals and farty bass with razor sharp slices for good effect dancehall steel drums and a vocal sample of a ragga man chanting girl give the tune a distinct jamaican feel and a slight sing-a-long element side b jean jacques smoothie - moving on (ben lex mix) beats bobz residents ben lex take jean jacque smoothies dub infused house tune moving on and give it a deeper feel dancehall beats accompany a dub/reggae synth hook while mc chickaboos vocals get laid down on top to add to the mayhem ben lex give it a long and deep bassline to make it perfect for chill out sessions on the dancefloor or to finish up a mix (hint )
for the 15th installment of the fabric series the crew from farringdon blesses us with something that doesn t quite fit the norm not only is the mix musically a little special but the mix is mixed and compiled over 2 discs then the usual 1 disc format the lucky man who has been given this task is under the tyrant banner craig is undoubtedly one of the driving forces behind the success of the club and he is the man that started the series with the very tasty fabric 01 he returns and delivers a very unique mix and while it may take a few listens to get to grips with once the settle dusts you ll be pleased to know lies a very twisted and brilliantly arranged compilation something that is a little different in this mix is that disc one is probably the more club friendly mix of the two unlike the traditional format where disc one usually warms up to the second disc the mix opens up quite nicely with the creepy and moody six of one (part one) by minimal man soon enough though the deep baselines that conquer the first disc are soon introduced most notably early by vibes by seafoam and then by the eight miles high mix of w u o by carsten jost mia s river is without doubt a stunning highlight in the entire mix while the twisted bleeps and shattering low-end sounds of face the flames by jeremy caulfield are again mind warping and strangely addictive the soul capsule mix of pantytec s elasobabe lifts the pace midway into the first disc while the addictive sounds of orange mistake by luciano and quennum will make you reach for the volume knob in excitement creepy sounds entrap the senses in the unique sounds of athan dance by mirwais sangin while the hypnotic swirls of no 5 from the bang goes ep start to bring the mix to a fantastic climax the creeching stabs of the brilliant michale mayer and pensum is a late highlight as is the very funky the trick by morane the stunning lucky charm by ada is left to close disc one off in style which it does and it closes off a disc that is undeniably one finest releases to date pure brilliance disc two is definitely just as interesting as the first more downtempo and just as unique as the first disc the mix opens up with the very quirky words by brownman greenman meets kv5 food and fuel by morgan geist is another nice smooth early highlight in the mix with its quirky drum patterns and guitar like bass twinges the 80 s vibe is brought back with minimum of life by joakim and continued with systematic by fastgraph systematic texas chip in with a seductive cut in put your arms around me a fusion of a deep rolling baseline and cheeky vocal snippets while the quirky sounds and eerie soundscapes of programming by d i e again install the uniqueness of this mix the mix starts to build and take a tougher shape with the extremely twisted tottentanz by dettinger but soon comes down a notch again most notably with the slow quirky sounds of on that tip by anthony shaker the electrified sounds of dabrye s smoking that edge struggle to find words that aid its description while silence is defeat by the warlock makes a description easy due to its quite massive baseline the mix however ends in unique fashion as you would expect with whip by alphabet city one thing that comes to mind when i hear is unique he is very much a man with his own sound a unique talent for finding those records that no one else can find and an ear for a sound that many may not understand one thing that is clear though and that the music he plays although not obvious is somewhat strangely addictive many would have experienced this with the tyrant mixes with partner in crime lee burridge but it is another experience when craig is on his own and this what this mix is a very unique and wonderful experience and a listening experience that seems to get more enjoyful with each listen

how deep is too deep that seems to be the question you have to ask when approaching s latest ostensibly set up in homage to the mole peoples deep house classic reak night the label/artist has been on a steadily reductive path since its inception telescoping with each subsequent release down to the barest slivers of sound so while the expression making a mountain out of a molehill connotes exaggeration and hyperbole the mountain made here has curiously wound up smaller than its source one wonders whether the crew believes its on the ascent or descent: are these barely-there grooves supposed to form the mountains base or do they represent its arid peak where only a few stray oxygen molecules keep you breathing thats all to say that those looking for the deep house splendor of the earlier releases may feel a bit underfed here by the extreme sparseness and lack of movement 006 is made of two warm rolling groovers that dont seem to yield much on first listen and ultimately its a matter of taste whether you find their unrelenting stasis compelling or soporific whatever your take on minimalism in music and on the limits of its ability to induce hypnotic states you cant really front on the production which remains as nimble and meticulous as ever on 006 1 check out the spritely dashes of hi-hats and cymbals and the indecipherable womans voice that murks around the groove like a spooked forest creature esides those touches however its a nearly skeletal composition something like a transmutation of what erik satie called furniture music : so immobile you could put your feet up on it 006 2 has a hat-led jacking pulse that makes it a bit meatier than its counterpart but one wonders why the rather-cliched house music vocal sample is particularly necessary oddly or maybe tellingly track 006 3 doesnt show up on the vinyl at all being instead relegated to the status of a eatport exclusive its a shame considering its the most solid tune of the three a straight-up house jam with well-placed filter shimmer and down-beat bass poke maybe it got in the way of the merciless aesthetic purification lets hope 007 isnt a john cage cover
ufos dont usually figure in the canon of heartbreak metaphors but thom yorke likes to do things differently on from s ninth album he sings: and in your life there comes a darkness / res a spacecraft blocking out the sky / and theres nowhere to hide / you run to the back and you cover your ears / but its the loudest sound youve ever heard a few seconds later a chorus with all the rainy grandeur of subterranean homesick alien sweeps into view news of yorkes separation from his partner of 23 years filtered out last year a few months after the release of another major breakup album unlike bj rks vulnicura however doesnt explicitly address the event for one thing many of its songs were written years beforehand but the knowledge of yorkes situation repeatedly crowds out other interpretations take for example the tail-end of numbing krautrock dirge when yorke pleads take me back / take me back again while a choir wails in the background or when he laments that broken hearts make it rain over dolorous strummed guitars or : its no ones business but mine / that all this love couldve been in vain as with vulnicura its hard to say whether the heartbreak gives s music a fresh power or whether the band happens to have found a new creative energy that amplifies the heartbreak it helps that theyve overhauled their sound airless electronica of 2011s king of limbs and yorkes solo work seems to have run its course instead his wounded voice is like the ragdoll mentioned in his lyrics: a helpless presence buffeted around by watery guitars spring-reverb spume and loose swirls of piano songs are mostly dark and spacious the sound of somebody marinating in unhappiness sometimes as in the pairing of and the musics tendency to wander gets frustrating but it can also add to the effect on yorke tries to convince himself that different types of love are possible but his fingerpicking has strayed into a minor key suggesting that things arent quite so simple yorke has rarely been capable of bj rks emotional openness and in places he falls back on a stale preachy mode opener is a -by-numbers decrial of media shaming and folksy climate change protest song is about as trite as it sounds but these moments are counterbalanced by three of the best ballads of the bands career res the gorgeous tragic which features the best of several great string arrangements by jonny greenwood n theres in which a panicked yorke finds a path that trails off / and heads down a mountain / through the dry bush i dont know where it leads his mumble disappearing under a brilliant cumulus of strings and then at the end of theres yorkes relationship with the song dates back to 1995 not so far off 23 years and it appeared on 2001 live album i might be wrong back then it sounded boyishly romantic; now transposed from acoustic guitar to piano its cold and hopeless vulnicura had one of these callback moments too: a lyrical echo of 2002s cocoon in history of touches it s the sort of move you can only pull if your career spans your adult life and if your fans are still listening as intently now as they were then following shaky albums from both yorke and suggests that they were right to keep the faith
sophie sweetland is one of the more distinctive artists to emerge from vancouvers thriving scene her output is varied and recognizable using crafty hand percussion and crude breaks with a dusty sound palette the first solo ep on is her most vibrant record yet charming with oddball rhythms and curious samples tracks like which utilises hip-hop-style breaks and where dense hand percussion sounds like slowed-down jungle are loaded with subtle effects and modest synth leads that burrow into your head take the title tracks faded melodies and exaggerated bassline its a piece of laid-back bass-heavy vancouver house but sweetlands windswept bongos add a tinge of psychedelia best captures sweetlands evocative qualities stoned and propulsive it works the 90s synths of her dj zozi project in with rollicking percussion all while another vancouver artist on the rise deadpans phrases like im tryna dance im good and are you its the kind of track you either fall in love with or find frustrating but like most of what sweetland produces and djs its bound to leave an impression
has long been the dark horse of the ostguts techno roster lost somewhere in the considerable shadow of fellow erghain residents en klock and that other marcel fengler is a fine producer on his own terms with a powerfully slamming bass-centered twist on the labels reduced techno sound his tracks often incorporate minutely-sliced samples that shake microscopically in dizzying bouts of polyrhythmic motion fenglers last release was an unforgiving ep on luke slaters mote evolver two almost excessively brutal tracks that set him apart from his fellow erghainers by virtue of their unrestrained ferocity perhaps hes exorcised his demons then because his latest ep for usual home is a much softer house-informed affair is almost polite leaving aside the quaking thump of his earlier work in exchange for a jacking stomp though the clipped loops bring to mind the jazzy excursion of 2009s twisted leach whats most interesting about these tracks is the applied aging; if is somewhat retro is ancient the roughly filtered string samples creaking and colliding like hyperspeed tectonic plates rounding off the trio is the radiohead-sampling another track that takes fenglers already-severe looping to an extreme and buries the beat underneath a seasick orchestra of droning tones

londons latest sonic meander is on a deep and minimal tip touches of jazz quirky pops and cheeky clicks all courtesy of swiss producer gregory poncet aka poncet made a brief appearance on mv last year on the labels second ep with his cut nesquick a dark and spacious minimal tune that did the rounds nicely but hes probably better known as one-half of digitaline (alongside ps) through their success on lucianos cadenza label kicks off this release; jazz keys touching here and there vocal snippets taps tubs all used quite delicately is nothing inspiring but its got momentum and coasts by reasonably well catches the attention better; a deep swaying bass flanked by sharper hits and stabs while the atmospherics creep in to create a bit more drama its a dark and moody number nicely produced and easy to get lost in rounds us off a little more to the left more in tune to what we have grown to expect from the mv camp gregory creates a jerky jacking little groove with deep kicks pops and snaps the keys play loosely and are built up expertly there is an edge here but it also has plenty of drive for the dance floor just like the rest of the best of output

steven van hulle is part of a vibrant amsterdam house scene that also includes his frequent collaborators and san proper hes built up quite a discography working with them and others but his solo releases have been few and far between his overflowing debut album is long and lovably disjointed finally allowing us a look into his quirky mind split over three separate -inches you d hesitate to call it an album at all it definitely doesn t work as a sit-and-listen experience but perhaps more importantly it establishes as a worthy artist in his own right joyous and sun-kissed at every turn is hard to dislike even if it wears out its welcome just a bit each record here has its own defined personality but if theres one thing that unites them all its van hulles upbeat disposition african music and latin rhythms are woven deep in the roots of this music and theres a liveliness to it that makes even simple workouts (like the subtle swing of ) feel special on the first record van hulle gets surprising mileage out of the simple contrast between sampled drums and the nylon texture of synthesizers slippery chords wobble beneath a buoyant rhythm track on what is a wonderful slice of early morning deep house its easy to imagine this first ep being a breakthrough release on its own things flag slightly on the second -inch that same lifelike drum palette turns into hippie-dance drum circle material without lead melodies to keep it interesting ten-minute a smoky hand percussion jam smoulders nicely but feels strangely funkless record is also home to a samba-esque track embellished by nine-piece jazz band which sounds like it belongs on a tv infomercial moments like this make van hulle out to be a bit of a cheeseball a trait that can be endearing or frustrating depending on your own level of cynicism res a mischievous quality to almost everything touches he cant help it his music is fun and uplifting above all else while the three-ep format feels like a cop-out when were told that is meant to be an album some might see it as a more effective way to release club music and with at least two eps worth of solid gold material spread over its sprawling six sides its got more to offer than most producers debut albums
cold and clinically minimal soundscapes crafted with icy precision are what youre likely to expect from a finnish architect-turned-dance music producer nightless eves of endless sun in the summer and only a few hours of daylight during winter has notorious effects on the psyche: agitation depression mood changes social disquiet and despite affirming that the finnish term for echo is a reflection of his life 100 as it is now in berlin those nervy side effects of his finnish homeland certainly inform his work its those brushes with the dark side which suck you in throughout but s sophomore lp isnt all sterile and desolate: it has yin to the yang malevolent awkward undertones are countered with a sonic warmth and depth which give its complex persona s artsy full-lengths tend to be growers: not instantly loveable but instead interesting works which need repeated listens to be really unravelled and while has these challenging moments it has its fair share of straight-up dance floor bombs as well for example has alien ambience being bullied from below by a militant kick and is the sort of solid dark house that pokerflat fans would lap up but the digital world it documents is a complete volt-face from the previous track is a vocal lead organic affair with strings and click-clack percussion coming together in an edgy almost uncomfortable way unrest which runs through comes from neither one sonic pool nor another and is neither future digital nor retro analogue but always flitting somewhere in between emotional discord is presented by the rippling keys and cosmic twitches of which whilst recalling global communication arent allowed to define the tracks tone instead theyre contradicted by a nagging fawning electro stab and twist which makes you somehow feel sorry for it as if its literally the sound of your heart strings being plucked instantly your vulnerable state passes though as quickly limbers up from a low-slung swagger and shapes into a smartly shuffling house stomper which lifts your mood skyward it glides along pushing introverted thoughts from the previous track south and suggests all is well in s skitty emotional world once again has shades of dilla in its driving black funk and sultry undertones which ooze from guest mc simone may be a little disjointed but the disparate tones and tempos of the record categorise it not as no-brain forgettable dance floor fodder but rather a smartly composed and diverse listening experience

named after the town in germany from which he originates specialises in producing feel good party tunes filled with lashings of hip hop disco latin grooves and overflowing with funk internationally hes already produced two albums - the spirit of and no risk no funk however local australian distributor and record label has realised the damage hes caused with his singles that theyve decided to take the best from both albums and compile them into for his aussie based fans the vibe of the album can be best summed up in the title track features a funk mc (a funk version of fatman scoop) who incites the crowd to shout and get busy while a dirty funk bassline disco style horns and guitar lick provide suitable accompaniment in the spirit of funk the tune also features b-boy style breakdowns allowing the drummer and percussionist to get busy - similar in many ways to the breakdown used in dee-lites groove is in the heart overkill features the vocals of ragga mc weedy gonzales and the tune is a cross between grimey breakstep (on a light hearted tip) and heavily syncopated broken beats with an electro hook and bassline laid down for good measure the law is wrong brings the album back to latin infused disco flavours (check the horn riff ) featuring a deep male vocal and a catchy bassline melody its not all uptempo funk the rich drops the tempo down to about 90bpms and is arranged for a live funk band featuring a horn section triple synth combo and james brown style vocals courtesy of richard kim pad thai slows the tempo down even further to deep laidback lounge music featuring an ethnic vocal sample for those who are familiar with the freestylers classic tune ruffneck will instantly associate with the skanking jump up beats of ska wars - ragga mc shouts fatman scoopish mc samples dancehall beats and a spacey synth hook that wouldnt sound out of place in a star wars movie i dont see why couldnt have named one of his earlier albums because it certainly is a most suitable title for the approach he takes to writing tunes 8 years ago this would have been categorised under the big beat umbrella however its more than than just retro rock guitars and cheesy drum loops - this is feel good music at its finest - what bentley rhythm ace should have been making back then
alongside contemporaries such as max richter and nico muhly micha is part of a generation of modern classical composers whose music is big on grand gestures and emotional melodies if that music can sometimes seem too saccharine s best albums treny and glimmer cut through the syrup with field recordings and electroacoustic effects hes an artist with one foot in electronic music and the other in the classical world and few can balance the two realms so well though each of his releases is different from the last is a sharper left turn than usual the idea behind the polish word for flowers came to while he was reading an anthology of english renaissance poetry the sing-song verse of robert herrick much of it about the beauty of life and love struck a chord with he rifled through his older unused recordings to set the poems to music and enlisted a trio of singers led by hania malarowska whose haughty tones attempt to emulate the gorgeous cadence of herricks stanzas the result is an album thats touching at some points and distant at others much in the same way that reading poetry from another era can feel s opening section is captivating the songs are immense yet delicate like fortresses built from dust and cobwebs the sound of fingers on fretboards and nylon strings rings out into the abyss on the opener the plucked strings on glow against dark murmurs and worn-out sounds the albums ornate decoration and monochrome feel can get numbing over time and malarowskas stiff vocals dont help while the melodies on tracks like and are gorgeous on other songs malarowskas self-serious style obscures the poetrys meaning and feeling its sometimes difficult to tell whether shes reciting love poetry or a eulogy herrick is known for celebratory poems whose central message implores people to live life to the fullest that sentiment gets lost in translation on which sounds more goth than gleeful its telling that the scrape of a fretboard is a more powerful device on the album than the vocals at the centre of it s music suggests deep meditation and introspection but this albums vocals have all the subtlety of a broadway musical the result is one of s richest and most complex works but also his most flawed his rainy-day compositions are as beautiful as ever on though its hard to say they carry the spirit of what inspired them
s music has an oddly aristocratic air about it the literally-titled a collection of tracks from the late 90s and early 00s is an example of this the ep embroidered with pristine sonic detail wouldnt play nicely in scruffy lo-fi company most of watsons fragments are soulful techno tools that try to capture a yogic serenity the first two tracks especially signals the start of a gentle incline as the drums begin to thump a little harder and the notes coil into tighter circles but its not until that watson stretches himself its smouldering pads buttress one of the eps more affecting melodies the arrangements on the preceding tracks make less of an impression is the records most distinctive moment its mournful piano keys are given a mad mike-style burst of funk conjuring a feeling thats both plaintive and celebratory
over the last 20-plus years ed upton has released an incredible amount of music on a range of labels including rephlex spectral sound permanent vacation and his own breakin records under his best-known alias the british producer adds to the list with his first release of the nine-track album continues to mine the type of machine-made synth-streaked music this prolific artist has written throughout his extensive career album opener sets the tone: straightforward but rhythmically effective its propelled by hardware beats and bouncing basslines that underpin a series of playful melodic hooks and buzzy chords that no-nonsense production approach appears throughout with uptons penchant for clever synth lines at the forefront of each track as it develops the lp strikes a healthy balance between 4/4 material and broken beat grooves disco-laced tracks like wooly and spread spacey sequences over steady kicks while and the frantically funky use electro beats under their woozy assemblages of sci-fi synth work its clear that upton comes from an older school of electronic music hes been making tracks since the early 90s he has a large array of aliases hes unstoppably prolific and all of his music sounds like it was made with a few synths and a drum machine his decades-long consistency and loyalty to his craft can be reassuring but it can also create limitations all of is built with more or less the same components: drum machines establish the rhythm a melodic hook is presented early on (eventually joined by chords or other synth lines) before being stripped away and brought back shortly thereafter save for the dark driving al or the pleasantly meandering upton spends little time developing atmosphere and takes few left turns is another quality effort from a producer who has more than proven his credentials over the past two decades after nine tracks though one cant help but feel like there were some missed opportunities here especially for a producer with dozens of albums to his name (to say nothing of singles) upton is too hesitant to stretch his aesthetic boundaries the result is an album that rich as it is feels constrained by its sonic parameters
yes it is exactly how it sounds has decided the real party is at the circus or here is a percussive fest of tribal boing toms shakers and vocal howling building a busy polyrhythmic dance-off simulating a colourful domed cave filled with clumsy parading clowns gyrating gymnasts acrobatics and all kinds of stunts and tricks its tribal-funk and vocal murmuring acting as an offbeat villalobos-type hook creates a devastating impact much as it did on his previous primal floor-killer momomowha nd in its eleven building and shape-shifting minutes is the sort of marathon of fun and hi-jinx that we have come to expect from the man from denmark lately -side is a downbeat warm-up piece for a deep tech-house session that relies on a single synth stab to sustain the low-pitched bassy grooves it clarifies s disinterest with obvious melody and his love of percussive timbres and hypnotic phrases looped into other phrases to form a single song mini-mix within a mix

its hard to picture what the musical landscape might look like today without stefan betke taking his recording name from the analog waldorf 4 filter betke set the standard for what we now know as minimalism across three sequentially numbered albums in 998 999 and 000 while others had clearly done minimal techno before him as well as fused the dub influence to it betke added a key element to the mix: art with monochromatic color-coded sleeves the none-more-blue -red and -yellow covers of his albums might have at first seemed appropriately simple given the material contained therein but they were really saying something deeper something conceptual something genuinely avant garde stare at the single colors long enough and your eyes will begin to play tricks on you inside betke pulls those same tricks on your ears look at any a photograph in any magazine; then examine the photograph under a magnifying glass then a microscope the ink the very texture of the paper and blending of the primary colors as more and more dots work in conjunction to create new worlds with each magnification this is the effect of on the listener the revelation that there is a whole universe living inside one tiny molecule on your big toe reissuing this trio of long players as a collected set wherein the intensity and craft in the music must be consumed whole was a masterstroke this is music of extraordinary feeling of an almost tactile sense of electricity and infinite detail working in conjunction to create a whole new universe each tiny crackle and pop reverberates in oceanic space while the listener floats below the surface the waves of mammoth dub bass filtering down from some crazy dance party going down on a glacier a few fathoms above your head minimalism and reductionism are minimized and reduced down to their very atoms then reconstructed in dr frankensteins lab sparked with new artificial life one can almost picture betke screaming its alive over the waldorf 4 in the studio to newcomers this trio of classics (supplemented by four bonus tracks) frankly might be a tad boring; after all this isnt the minimalism of villalobos and his generation but to label the music as such is to miss the point entirely there are genuine pop melodies that stir electronic rhythms that move and all manner of noises to marvel over for the attentive listener playing as mere background music is to insult betkes craft deeply; deep close listening reveals the greatest rewards play it on a big system and marvel at the depth; play it on headphones and wonder at the detail scapes timely reissue ensures that another generation has a chance to be grabbed shook and inspired by these masterpieces of the modern age

adam xs industrial-tinged experimental project - sounds pretty much exactly like youd expect foreboding dark and hopeless every time you hear something like a piano reach out of the murk its quickly joined by something gnarled beyond recognition indeed if you didnt know that x likes to carefully delineate his projects (hes the man behind the hypnotic techno of traversable wormhole as well) youd be forgiven for wondering why this came under a different name at all it could have just as easily been the sort of downtempo and experiments -style album that many techno producers offer up when it comes time to make the leap into the world of albums like many of those full-lengths second system is based on a concept x was a graffiti artist in the 80s bombing the new york city subway system along with joey beltram and many others in exploring the underground tunnel network that connected the lines he eventually discovered unfinished stations and dead-end tunnels naturally curious he learned that they were part of a huge undertaking in the 20s and 30s to serve emerging neighborhoods in the city that got scrapped before it could be completed (world war ii and the citys shift in focus toward automobiles being the main reasons ) second system is the sound of x remembering what it was like to find such a ghostly labyrinth as a result most of the material on second systems tends to work exceptionally well on first listen theres a sense of the unknowable throughout and a dread that mustve accompanied x when he couldnt find an explanation as to why these tunnels existed bangs along with an increasing ferocity that suggests the queasiness that comes with an unsolvable mystery the has that aforementioned piano accompanied by what sounds like a distorted cloud of guitar lurking behind it there are brief moments of respite the synth line on evokes the second word in its title instead of say nightmares its also one of the albums least successful songs though its unclear whether thats simply because x doesnt handle lightness well or because it sounds incredibly dated industrial as a general rule hasnt done as well as other genres in that latter regard which is why when he veers toward more abstract climes like or you get the sense that you could quite easily come back to them in 2025 as for second systems showcases a side of adam x that many havent heard before the immaculate sound design on those traversable wormhole 12-inches was no accident and when employed to less floor-specific ends x proves capable of inspiring the same sort of atmosphere

having already contributed to two of the first three releases by nascent cologne label friends and musicians and share a side apiece on this beautiful ep of atmospheric and deep techno bagsies the a side; features signature warm melodic pads backwards vocal excerpts and little vignettes of synths dropped in across the piece its a glistening yet somewhat mournful slice of smooth techno is a more menacing affair paints and is an accomplished photographer and theres a widescreen feel to this mildly jacking workout of bassy synth growls 808 claps and chiming melodic passages flip over and a like minded musical soulmate and mutual sounding board for stitches hissing hi hats to twinkling synth flourishes and a brooding bassline on beast in think slam in a reflective mood completes an ep full of promise waves of analog synths snappy drum programming and reverb laden icy melodic trills balearic or should that be baltic techno anyone
like his alias suggests torontos stuart li is a no-nonsense kind of producer he has an old-school minimalist approach honing in on raw machine grooves and grainy analog textures with laser focus last time recorded for adam marshalls imprint even the titles sounded dryly functional: rhythm no 1 basic necessity this time hes allowed himself more poetic license but the music is more elemental than ever begins as a mere wisp of a track just a lone ping rising and falling over a half-time kick drum with a backbeat thwack dutifully keeping time; as a single tentative chord swells and the midrange gathers mass the track rolls like a small craft too far out to sea squeezed between the waves and the fog soaked in reverb and flashing metal accents is berghain-grade techno par excellence but again theres an unusual softness as though concrete walls were wrapped in cotton batting thing in the loping groove recalls dancehall reggae a welcome reprieve from technos four-to-the-floor default true to its title is a descent into murky churning chords dubbed to hell and back with crisp 909 snares illuminating the path is the eps fullest cut and its most sensual thrumming with colorful arpeggios counterpoints that tie the heartstrings up in knots and stately piano chords with an almost latin feel many producers might have made this their ; its position here feels emblematic of the same sense of restraint that makes s music so enveloping
man in a box is a release from last year by englishman steve barnes who previously scored a hit with a track actually titled since then barnes has also released zig-zag feeling on and worked with traums dominik eulberg amongst others this time around he adopts as his moniker and calls on andre kraml and daso for remix duties andre kraml who is best known for his crosstown rebels track safari (remixed by james holden) gets a call to remix the a-side cast your mind back to orange lemons dreams of santa anna and its warped-pitch on the vocal and youll feel the connection featuring a low slung bassline down and dirty there are lots of elements bubbling away in this piece almost fighting to make an appearance under loads of compression kramls remix of man in a box is without a doubt a sandwich of cosmic proportions with weirded out witch cackles glitchy computer noises vibrato effects and generally loony vibes that grab you immediately the remix from indie house producer daso opens with a swish of a spacey chord before a clunking beat made up of so much mid-range kicks off sounding like a noise youd get from banging two metal pipes together underwater more crunchiness is added with an electronic finger-click and this remix starts to sound like future house from another galaxy an arpeggiated-synth modulates to give us a revamp on that moroder-styled bassline but this suddenly evaporates and after a brief voice snippet we are launched into an incessant driving piece of electronica more vocal samples tell us to get physical and indeed we should as this track is flowing with energy this feels like some of those classic hard-prog tracks from days gone by (circa the probe releases on the limbo label) re-rubbed with a techy touch and a breath of fresh air ensuring this track sounds bang up-to-date this remix package of s man in a box is a sparky uptempo affair but personally speaking from a djs perspective the daso mix would be the one id be most likely to use
that photograph of from his 2008 r podcast really fits the bill: shaggy-haired five-o-clock-shadowed and rubbing his eyes like he either just woke up or really really needs to hit the hay if you have even a passing acquaintance with the canadian-bred berlin-based producer ( k colin de la plante) youll know that he often sports just as fuzzy an appearance nd its tempting to imagine that the inside of his head is just as fuzzy at least judging from the sound of his productions there are no clean lines in a mole record no up or down; like a lot of deep house its swirly stuff but its not always elegant exactly theres a lot of shuffling and bumping in the dark a lot of barked shins and stars whizzing around foreheads thats true of both queque and each one a tangle of scraps that dont entirely feel like they belong together but are nonetheless impossible to tease apart dozens of disparate (and faintly detuned) vocal strands flashes of rhodes and guitar loping breaks sleek machine rhythms funky bass loops coiled so tight they feel like knots the way he tamps down his filters gives everything a muted faraway quality the overall effect is silken and lumpy all at once nevertheless both tracks go hard the closing jonny isnt as impressive; its deep house bounce feels more rote and its sense of space and proportion is more conventional certainly compared to the inscrutable dimensions and druggy nether regions of the other two cuts
provides a two tracker for the next release on german based as the label comes very close to hitting the half century mark is first up and it is quite a solid production full of energy from the word go it has quite a quirky feel throughout yet it is decidedly full and thick thanks to the solid baselines throughout and the squeaky acid riffs customer service has some smoother elements thanks to the warm pads but parts are just as quirky such as the percussive stabs and bouncy baseline that keeps an addictive flow happening a pretty solid release here on a very solid label
in explaining the aesthetic of his label to me milo smee repeatedly returned to the word mental likening his favourite sounds to op-art or cubism where your brain cant quite process whats going on this musical vision inspired by the absurdism and sonic extremity of rave is clear on the labels latest release is one of idms lesser-known legends a veteran of rephlex records who has lately kept a low profile (prior to s recent vectors 2 compilation he had been quietly self-releasing his music for the better part a decade ) sometimes he embodies the friendly side of braindance as demonstrated on this years whimsical quantum loonyverse lp but in smee has selected a group of tracks that show at his most unhinged result might be the weirdest release yet in s already weird catalogue though the eps best moments keep at least a tenuous grip on dance floor convention on and a series of brain-bending synth loops crawl over a primitive techno framework elsewhere on the madcap electro-funk of or the disturbingly jaunty he manages to conjure earworming melodies from the most toxic of materials it all gets a bit much in places particularly on the breakneck where silliness overtakes strangeness even so its difficult not to admire s determination to rewire your brain
quietly and assuredly whether on keinemusik the erlin label/collective he co-founded or as here on nic fanciullis saved me is building a rep as one of the most reliable smartest and innovative of germanys contemporary house brigade much of that you feel is down to raunch because both and shes reeks of the funky sweaty stuff the former shuffles along with a distorted spoken vocal for accompaniment and an odd barking rhythm like a twisted form of razilian cu ca then midway through it veers off into freeform jazz working the entire kit like uddy rich after an espresso before rejoining the groove with even greater gusto ut its shes that will get the most attention its heavy with atmosphere almost religiously so s a deep-voiced lothario gives you the chat another vocal is introduced but in only the briefest of forms stretched out to a low hum that could almost be mistaken for a gregorian chant onto this is layered distant rim shots crunching hi-hats and whipcrack toms eventually reaching a climax (far more appropriate a phrase here than breakdown) of ghostly military snares before settling back into a toughened-up take on its original groove its achingly cool and ever so deeply sexual
fans of s monolithic starless (not to mention its companion starless reshapes record) have cause for celebration stefaniks new long-player (also released by ) largely sticks to the kind of cosmic detroit-fed product he brought to market on those records i say largely because stefanik wanders from that path quite a bit forgoing homogeneity to include tracks orbiting on axes rather distant from the lean brooding techno at the albums gravitational center an agile journeyman stefanik has already left plenty of evidence of his dexterity in a range of neoclassical styles and with he proves quite comfortable pursuing several disparate sonic directions the least conspicuous of the albums deviations is a troddin slow-burner of weathered rootsy dub more notable are stefaniks forays into house territory and incorporating toms cowbells and a faint soulfulness reminiscent of a sanded-down theo parrish the most jarring variation surely is an acid burst of metallic rapid fire percussion thats unlike anything else on the record all this lends a versatility that keeps the album on its feet for the duration of its minutes in the main though is held together by a downbeat backbone that should sit well with anyone with a fondness for chain reaction fare (take for example the opening and closing cuts or especially ) a stately almost somber album is choice headphones material and does come equipped with several fine pulls for more energetic and less solitary enjoyment its a record that doesnt clamber for attention and doesnt seem at pains to forge a bold singular identity for its creator but these shouldnt be marks against a listen as consistent as satisfying or as cohesive as this one

drafted in specifically to add bite to aron fit siegels second release on omar-ss label kassem mosse (billed here under his own name gunnar wendel) supplies keyboard programming with a freight cargo thump that has become a hallmark of the german producers most notable work taken as a whole though the ep retains a sketch-like quality synonymous with both fxhe and wendel for example feels like the coalescing of two or three ideas across its mid-tempo stomp noodling synth the sort youd hear at the title sequence of a high school science documentary oscillates quietly before wendels mud-caked drums enter what begins to escalate into a fray once the duos floor-appropriate bassline slots itself in the is an even more interesting fruition of the push-and-pull dynamic at play between fit and wendel formers plaintive yamaha strokes lend an unsettling gothic quality to another hard-nosed groove with shutter-speed handclaps that sound almost as tough as the low-end meanwhile gouges the melody out completely leaving a cacophonous husk of kicks hats and claps that while useful highlight fits importance to a fine collaboration
contemporary club music is slippery terrain but sometimes a firmer shape appears in the shifting sands some ( myself included ) have noted the young artists doing new things with uk funky the much-missed style isnt the whole story though its part of a global palette of influences balancing the 4/4 pulse and syncopated percussion calls this stuff hard drum he has more right than most to name it since hes been working on something like this since his 2011 debut he took a break in the mid-10s but has since returned as part of a recent productions mix outlined his hard drum vision as you mightve guessed its not big on melodies instead the focus is on legions of percussion marshalled into patterns resembling the likes of dutch bubbling portugals pr ncipe crew and 90s tribal house the results arent as polychrome as that sounds sharp cold and unforgiving his drum tracks get a bit exhausting when lined up in a row this record s second for her doesnt shed the coldness but it highlights the mixs more characterful tracks stands out for its synth lead a wail half-heard through batteries of pumped-up claps and snares on tight-skinned snares roll and rattle against the beat like bugs thundering into a window pane both are dramatic full-bore club weapons the compression is cranked up and white noise whooshes abound the odd one out is in which s lead line returns over stranger rhythms sets up the surprise with an extended intro peppered with tense chord stabs and dramatic foley fake-outs when it comes the tracks staggering triplet beat turns the nascent hard drum formula on its head
eterkin releases a lot of music made with a workmanlike consistency a good tune is smooth danceable and atmospheric records under aliases like fp-oner black jazz consortium and the techno-influenced anomaly highlight the different sides of his sound but its rare to hear a single release explore the full spectrum of his aesthetic but peterkin does exactly that on his debut with serene pads and jazzy keys is like something from an fp-oner album but more jacking its also more tribal than peterkins usual material across he prefers hand percussion over drum machines on drums bob up and down as if caught in a current; on the drums are fluid and should hypnotize late-hour dance floors the drums dull impact on adds to its hazy vibe the heavily syncopated is the eps most intriguing track tough and graceful at once its a reminder of peterkins ingenuity
se days the (how do you pronounce that ) are known more as djs playing long drunk after hours sessions than they are as producers peppering their rambunctious minimal sets with such incongruous sounds as opera and making it work the duos own releases possess a similar prankster ish spirit or at least they try to y had a minor hit with the relatively straightforward wombat for kompakt but theyre more prolific as remixers using other peoples work as an excuse to throw in the digital kitchen sink known individually as and monkey maffia its who dominates their output his (and their) sound veering from pointillist dm to equally scattershot techno exemplified by 00 s wuzzelbud kk ts a good thing they like booze as without it these frenzied tracks could skitter well off the scale already remixx potpourri is a dizzying collection with even the chilled out moments rammed with fizz and buzz like having a video arcade lodged in your brain originals range from to but once given the wighnomy treatment they all emerge uniformly shredded trebly shards and glitter sprinkled liberally over everything sometimes this works: royskopps keeps the glossy norwegian surge largely intact adding subtle laptop tinkerings and coming across like a mille plateaux mix of the pet shop boys ir re(h)and remix of s turns the austrian chanteuses bjork ian tones into deep echoing caverns shuffling along to a cocktail rhythm of clattering castanets and crickets erworlds retains more low end than is usually preserved a dub pulse laid over gruffly uttered beat poetry the trademark clamour colliding and reverberating into a thunderous techno chug s proceeds almost patiently with david gahans voice chopped and multiplied beside plangent guitar lines sliced into klimek like slivers overall however its exhausting the wighnomys more eager to dazzle with a relentless barrage of digital bluster than create funk both and have their works vacuumed dry all depth replaced by stuttering nerves and surface clatter of s gets a limp re edit dripping in boards of canada twee alien and s is so frantic it could appear on planet mu and even the ambient closer s has its beautifully unrolled chords interrupted with abrupt bursts of noise ts a mixed bag in both senses
if you want to know how the music that rocks the main vein of underground club dancefloors has evolved over the past few years you couldn t get a much better document than the mix cd back catalogue in 2004 rebel futurism 1 was brimming over with playful slick electro house like t s freemind but on rebel futurism 2 this gave way to cologne emotionalism and harder techno sounds finally last year s get lost was full on minimal this time around lazarus has moved aside for which seems very emblematic of the current shift away from minimal techno and towards housier deeper tracks nd indeed this is also reflected in the music it would be hard to imagine a more accurate sketch of the sounds that are big right now than this mix re are electrifying moments here like s which hits very hard with sirens and aggressively punchy beats or ones own with its queasy rolling bass giving way to rising metallic arpeggios nd then of course there is the obvious but still dramatic inclusion of s can t but the stand out is probably s fantastically named and it stands out precisely because it doesn t fit into the neo deep neo detroit pigeonhole in which the rest of the mix resides it has big overdriven riffs but doesn t blare them at the listener ed banger style instead it folds undercuts and phases them to create euphoria which is made sublime by following it up with the aforementioned mr all this feels like a mix that you want to like it s well blended up to the minute and has nicely judged transitions but like a lot of the neo deep house it champions it just isn t terribly exciting for many avid tech house heads that isn t an issue this is a style of mixing that prides itself on establishing drawn out flowing grooves rather than euphoric peaks of excitement however i have to say that personally that i prefer a little more drama in my mixes that s not to say that ones is a bad in fact he s a very good one the transitions and programming here are beautifully judged and manage to make many of the tracks more exciting than might otherwise be but it does feel as though he was under a certain obligation here to stick to the ctr house style of mix cds which is that all the tracks must be recent and upfront (as opposed to say michael mayer s habit of using tried and tested personal favourites) perhaps he felt restricted by the need to use what is currently popular so if you enjoy this new strain of deep tech house this is a great cd for you however i have to say that this particular musical evolution does worry me because unlike electrohouse and minimal this is very familiar territory for dance music its not territory that is very likely to excite those outside the current club scene and youngsters attention is more likely to be swayed by the dayglo fashion shenanigans of the indie dance posse

young dance producers paying homage to early 80s post-disco tend to do so reverently lots of good music has resulted from this approach but it misses a key aspect of that music and indeed plenty of r b the humor dam- on the other hand has been playing this kind of stuff long enough playing it not just spinning or sampling it to resist it on his l a confrere benedeks thats jam dam outlines a record geeks storybook romance in which he finds a woman so true that shes into the same boogie funk he is busting a lung on lines like come on girl and get your boogie on yeah heh by the end he gives it away completely: you know what that means for me i get to party with her thank you for getting down with me goofy and lovable it kids the tradition it works in buoyed by a rolling groove and zapping keyboards; djs who prefer things a little less exuberant will probably go for the sparkling instrumental there are a lot of remixes on this ep which seems less necessary than usual given the quality of the original a couple of them do acquit themselves decently anyway: benedeks mix is slower and moodier a title that reviews itself lawrence greys mix is wonky enough to fit on a non-anniversary-year ninja tune comp and sahy uhns has some fun turning it into tweaky dubstep none of them do much if anything with dam- s vocal which makes me think they all missed the point slightly the exception is knife s ep-ending cover version a quick-stepping absurdly goofy 8-bit rendition that reduces the original to pixels and charm

records were there first when the df brought the human touch back to dance music; when the df recorded the first sweaty palm slapping the first bass string of rapture s sub pop debut; when their leader murphy picked up a mic and delivered his state of the scene address ing edge ( i was the first guy playing daft punk to the rock kids ) when all this happened were there standing on the sidelines shaking their heads and waving a copy of disco not disco dnd preceded the punk funk explosion by a good two years and pre-empted it with tracks already two decades old it featured the earliest guitar bands to use their instruments to rock discotheques loose joints was (not was) and formed the template for the df sound by the time house of jealous rs hit the charts had released two compilations of leftfield disco classics from the new york underground and soon sold out of both but it s and no one talks about punk funk any more surely disco not disco has nothing left to offer well from the opening tracks of the new edition the continuing relevance of the series is obvious whole generation of bands has followed murphy s example and sold their turntables and bought guitars and for the likes of css cut copy and klaxons the original dance rock acts are essential listening still compilers quinton scott and last night dj saved author bill brewster know when it s time to move on with a remix by ugust k kid creole they bridge the gap between punk funk and disco just like df have and their recent signings (holy ghost mock toof prinzhorn dance school) could learn a lot here oddities that close the disc include precursors of nu disco electro and techno which begs the question: is there an electronic genre that wasn t invented in new york city between 1974 and so the latest dnd follows the same arc and tells the same broad story as previous volumes but the songs are so full of experiments and happy accidents that even the oldest (34 years old ) sound fresh loose-limbed low-slung funk of s permits surreal lyrics and a broken viola solo and on the solid bottom end provided by two basses allows s double tracked vocals to run riot when s bassist was off partying with one of madonna s dancers (you gotta *heart* ny) they used sequencers for the first time to create party : an extended jam of drum machines live percussion sax and chanting lo-fi production of their proto-techno track gives it a raw edge and next to the pristine 20 remixes by ectomorph and hacker vitalic it sounds like the dance equivalent of a garage band nyone who has either of the previous disco not discos already knows this is indispensable everyone else lucked out because you finally have the chance to hear a seminal slice of classic music that continues to make its influence felt just make sure you pick this up before it sells out
perhaps more than any other genre in dance music techno has a huge undercurrent of quality labels with very little recognition outside dj circles most feature the same characteristics: vinyl-only very little promotion quality packaging and most importantly great tunes is one of those labels the berlin operation has so far released six 12-inches from relatively unknown artists most accompanied by a couple of remixes from established acts founder ekserd supplies ressorts latest 12-inch which is also his debut release like everything on the label before it this diverse ep features four effective techno cuts has two originals with remixes by /y and svreca both originals are hard-hitting and trippy but with clearly different moods opener is the only peak-time banger with a cleverly distorted but clean kick and metallic samples prefer the other three tracks all of which are at the deeper end of the spectrum is prime late-hour material making use of a dubby rolling drum pattern centred on a tough kick /ys rework is similarly subdued but a touch more expressive recalling the murky haze of their popular work on their own label svreca provides the eps the most challenging track an eight-minute atmospheric remix that djs brave enough to play could probably dazzle a crowd with expect to be around for a while if it continues dishing out records like this
consisting of a track from each label founder the second record on dur could be a manifesto for the leipzig outfit it lays out its aims with particular focus and vigour presenting two hyper intense techno workouts whose druggy hypnotism unfolds over a gurning ten minutes apiece has form in this regard: hes fresh from an equally trance inducing record on dresdens shtum his synth work which mimics the effect of a laser system scything through dry ice is pushed to new extremes here as is the tempo: thunders along at an arrhythmia inducing 140 pm the whole thing strobes relentlessly its form swelling and contracting according to a careful schema its hardly a novel idea but s execution is particularly fine s is similar: the same longform structure the same smoky synths and relentless techno churn if anything its yet more awesomely twisted but it also feels less well controlled the synth waft overpowers the drums upsetting the razor fine balance between levitation and earthbound churn
yes thats right you did read it correctly in the genre section of this review world class here delivers the goods without an ounce of hard house mixed by residents tim lyall and garry white the world class divison takes you on a journey where no other cd has gone before disc 1 begins with the dreamy northface remix of weird noises i wont go on to list every single track but the cd does progress towards a techy/tribal tip that will have you locked in a groove mark james brings out the vocals with hear me shortly followed by the funked up diva melodies of science departments breathe the starcase remix of pvds vega elevates the melody and intensity up another level back into the dream like state until you exit with fat harry disc 2 is my favourite its what ive termed the party cd beggining with the infamous smoke machine mixing in an out of the first five tracks on top of the dirty accapella this is a tapestry of hip swinging booty shaking action work it baby ;p following the house mayhem the beautiful vocals of mindcircus bring on a state of soothing trance but not for long as the funked up house kicks back in with sirens at first i thought my ears were teasing me with another mix of smoke machine jan johnston brings back the melody with superstar but its not long before lexy and k-paul bring to the fore the greatest dj ive termed this the party cd because you can just imagine these boys teasing the dance floor with their mixing brilliant its impressive to hear the non-hardhouse side of nick sentience working with tim healy to make you feel surrel very fresh indeed we are taken out with the uplifting synths of supernova and the way i like it world class is pure class
if you just listened to from s ep youd be given writing whole thing off modern deep house by numbers its among least essential tunes you may hear all year doing exactly what the that berlin-based producer obviously admires have done so many times in past its rick wade meets delano smith moodymann without a hint of personality as ep goes on tries out a few different ideas goes slower and has a tiny little piano line that sounds out of place enough you to sit up and take notice shows a tiny dub techno influence amid relentlessly downcast chord progression does same and even adds a vocal sample that tells us its habit ming each is better than last but problem with is that it reveals nothing about its producer ask me about what he likes and i could tell you immediately that moodymann and theo parrish are huge influences ask me what makes it special and id have to say i have no idea
it seems like both ppleblim and shackleton have taken quite a shine to torsten pr frock k over the past few years pr frock is the only artist to be commissioned to do two separate remixes on the now defunct skull disco label and here he appears again on ppleblims own label for his only solo release of s the titles would suggest both tracks that appear here were originally live jams from 1995 but pr frock has revisited and re-edited them in bleton live before sending them over to dubplates mastering to add the final touches (its little surprise that hes using the now ubiquitous bleton to chop and change these recordings seeing as his monolake partner-in-crime robert henke had a major hand in engineering the software ) udio1995 8 is the closest that has come to straight up techno in quite a while as mechanical delayed stabs fuse with fluttering sub-bass and a stern reverberated snare its quite a functional record which doesnt exactly do much apart from modulate the more trebly percussive sounds but will go down well in dark techno sets favoured by berghains acolytes the b-side again with the imaginative title of udio1995 8_2 offers a much different insight to pr frocks output during the mid-90s t a time when boundaries were still being pushed in drum bass pr frock was taking inspiration from those sounds using a flailing junglist breakbeat that hes pitched down here to a more dubstep-compatible 140bpm closer inspection reveals numerous detailed touches such as the subdued skittering percussion that mutates and modulates throughout the entire tracks duration but make no mistake this is a dark and dirty slab of breakbeat techno thats custom made for cavernous warehouses and grimy basements its not exactly the best material that pr frock has offered us in the last few years (its no space break ) but even a good track from him easily surpasses the best efforts of many current techno producers nd for that torsten we salute you
if you were looking for raw techno in and zeals do not resist the beat would have been a good first stop bradley has turned in four sublime 12-inches for the label each seemingly more tripped out than the last last time around bradleys remit was as hardwax put it nautical and that continues on the a-side to his newest its a slowed down dub tune that revels in open space letting its beats reverberate into infinity with a few sudden and abrupt volume shifts that shake you from potential reverie on the flip though bradley gets back to the floor with two unfiltered cuts that could easily make their home downstairs at tresor there is still enough of an aquatic undercurrent but the beat here is paramount propelling the waves of sound forward in s case a hi-hat slices through the middle reminding you that bradley is making what surrounds it lo-fi so as to better highlight the titular emotion nothing new here exactly but thats hardly the point: theres little wrong with some high-quality techno now and again
drawing on the talents of artists like roman fl gel and massimiliano pagliara the frankfurt-based rarely takes a wrong step from christian beisswenger one half of rto mwambe is no exception to this trend its three cuts are unusual in most ways structurally timbrally with the end result being a mild slap to the face discordant organ line helms the title track wandering dazedly amongst rapid fire snares and later sonorous glassy hits for those who dislike polite house this noisy ramshackle exploration of strange-sounding synths should find some favour it feels like the contents of a junk shop magically raised to life is more straightforward slowly building tension and emotion over eight sexy minutes incredibly thick and supple low-end is at the core of this passage snowballing forward and collecting bits of percussion and spasmodic synth shots as it goes its not particularly hooky but its shambling unstoppable groove will no doubt prove useful for slaying dance floors mid-set the sustained crystalline pads which sail through the mid-section arent too shabby either slashes the intensity offering a languid idm-style breakbeat flocked with idyllic synth pings and bird calls where the other two cuts are as solid and rich as a grand piano here a softer touch allows some air to seep in between the beats albeit in dusty form even when compared with beisswengers debut 12-inch as the citizens band last year just sounds really different; something we could do with a lot more of
fter a bit more than a decade of existence and five albums of original material it seemed fitting that rural-meets-modernist british duo proposed us a career retrospective last month aptly titled without fanfare theyve accompanied this collection with the single and twirling non-album exclusive two pieces of moderately noncommittal chamber pop that are truth be told among the duos most lukewarm offerings that said these shouldnt detract anyone from the fact the twelve singles that preceded them rank next to the synth pop genres best no wonder they have found a welcoming terrain of expression on indie imprint par excellence mute the inventors or at least guardians of the genre have now come to exemplify it too with sultry poise and prominent dexterity the main thing that strikes you is how well the material on offer here has aged their slower stage-managed songs ( and namely) from the felt mountain era have an undeniably timeless quality in the early 00s felt like an eccentric bird; only their live favorite cover version of olivia newton-johns physical hinted at something more groovy and even more importantly lighthearted and fun they fully developed these intuitions on their two subsequent albums at the height of the electroclash craze yet those sexily sanguine songs are still as immediate and enduring: with its panache and overall glam and especially the glorious a with their commanding display of an innate sense for melodies and attention to sonic details here they also come in re-mastered form the supplemental attention to background arrangements only nurturing the songs initial prismatic glow next to these electro pop nuggets e and its distant cousin (from the 2008 underrated seventh tree long-player) almost come across as perverse in their dedication to gentle acoustic strumming but theyre also a testament to the duos versatility personally i would have preferred the inclusion of psychedelic-lite single caravan instead of cavernous ballad but others could pointlessly weep over the absence of twist or live as well whats mainly to remember here is how lison and will gregory both helped set the table for the likes of florence and the marina and the diamonds and roux through their sultry take on electronic disco and baroque pop even na del reys self-fabricated glitzy maneuverers have some of their origins in lisons alluring posturing the songs reunited on should be celebrated by anyone fascinated by the uks long tradition of tuneful eccentrics
like that elusive chinese democracy album guns n roses always promised but never delivered (i m sure wouldn t mind the analogy) ivan smagghe and arnaud rebotini s first studio album in the making since 2001 s innerstring single if you think about it will apparently still have to wait a bit in the meantime fans are invited to chew on this: a compilation of the parisian duo s best ( ) remixes titled it is a fitting introduction to one of the most idiosyncratic production teams in dance music right now and a more than satisfying listen in its own right if s recent ventures into *gulp* minimalism are any indication ( last dub on earth nazi trance fuck off rebotini s solo productions smagghe s dj sets over the last eighteen months) then the duo s new material might be slightly different than what they ve got us used to with their remixes over the past few years but then again recording their album in london with paul phones epworth of white rose movement and bloc party fame is proof the band is interested in expanding its sound palette exhibit a: phones own industrial version of the band s shining bright star the only new material on this compilation it won t rally anyone new to their cause really considering it s closeness in spirit and execution to chemical sweet girl and it probably doesn t sound like what you think smagghe should be doing right now (aren t stephan bodzin and marc romboy already covering that territory anyway ) but it is satisfying to hear the band still being able to tighten it a bit and impose their own terms on a track which is what their remixing work is all about in the end right some will be scared by the goth-lite undertones of the production and the somewhat ludicrous romanticism of rebotini s vocals and lyrics but shining bright star is a nice reminder that sometimes funky people wear black too the nine remixes coming next will be known to anyone remotely familiar with post-electroclash trends on the current underground house and techno scenes mostly because their formula is let s face it pretty much always the same they superimpose their martial and (not-always-subtle) ebm-enhanced beats on top of the original work (the way they abuse sweet light s own delicate abusator is the closest you ll ever get to the aural equivalent of anal rape) while keeping the pop elements of the vocals and adding a few oscillating bleeps here and there smagghe and rebotini are at their best when they allow the influence of early warp stuff (think sweet exorcist forgemasters even tricky disco) to shine through their two-tone melodies and industrial atmospheres: the rapture s pulsating sister savior and david carretta the hacker millimetric s moscow reisen detonation (french electro s own self-absorbed we are the world ) are the most perfectly realized and efficient examples of the work ethos more mark bell less twiggy ramirez then that said it unfortunately doesn t always work out well and a remix collection is tarnished by the inclusion of one real sonic disaster s first remix of depeche mode s something to do from 2004 the most bs-friendly track of dm s entire back catalogue really so it should have been a marriage made in heaven kept just the is there something to do and i d put your pretty dress on lyrics thus enhancing the titillating connotations of the original the alternative remix they decided to put on here however with the entire dave gahan vocal sitting very uncomfortably on top of what is otherwise an impressive reconstruction is a totally difficult and frustrating listen and neither bs nor dm end up being flattered by it it is the sole moment of awkwardness on the compilation and in s entire career so far and it s a very misguided and disappointing piece of work fans are invited to hunt down the previously released version on some mute promos and stick to it or to skip to the remix of bloc party s like eating glass (included here) to see s usual talent at tweaking vocals and turning them into frozen anthems of lust and desire in factory-ridden metropolises and just when you thought were really starting to take their self-imposed discipline too seriously they remind you with their remixes of martini bros the biggest fan and dominatrix s dominatrix sleeps tonight that they can be playful and dare i say fun yes they love anorexic coked-up models with tits hanging out and puke in their hair just as much as you do but they also dig dominating chicks and effeminate berliners who can also bust a move you know s inclusions on a remix collection say a lot about the band s self-perception but their exclusions do too: by omitting their versions of alter ego s over-played rocker david guetta s pumping the world is mine or their frankly odd unreleased remix of eminem s without me are cryptically stating that they prefer to stay away from the limelight (duh ) it also seems that their summer camp take on w i t s hold me touch me which is all about soothing acoustic guitars ( ) and unresolved issues over unsatisfied tales of summer love and unfinished businesses will have to remain forever hidden it s their most intricate and luminous work to date an amazing remix doomed to only be available to some few lucky fans i like to think i am part of regardless of one faulty inclusion and one regrettable exclusion this compilation nevertheless confirms s unique and instantly recognizable voice and unparalleled sound not only on the post- homework french electronic scene of the 2000s but in the entire contemporary dance music world it might hurt a little sometimes as any real pleasure does but in the end arnaud and ivan sure know how to dance even if they don t smile a lot seems they were right all along: funk is not always where you think indeed
jesse kanda is best known as a visual artist whose work for the likes of arca fka twigs and bj rk has involved filming his own genitals and choreographing dance troupes of mutant babies his aesthetic is gruesome but its not without reason kanda has said he wants to present disgusting things as something beautiful his debut record as does just that the sound palette labyrinthine melodies played on weird blunted synths resembles arcas but the emotional tenor is slightly different theres an epic dimension in arcas work while kandas is more intimate drums are a stronger presence in the opening tracks plays on the contrast between forlorn melodies while a springy house beat propels them along proves harder to rouse from its heartsick stupor its dulled uk garage slouch only surfaces every now and then squint and its a zomby beat elsewhere kanda opts for an odd three-time feel sort of like a waltz he describes as sensual like a courtship presumably he means stilted and formal but powered by ardent feelings which sounds about right has a similar vibe over which sour chord passages slot together like wilted lego bricks these tracks have a tweeness that softens the musics emotional punch the closer is a song about losing someone you love and your self which sounds every bit as bleak as that suggests
in what is less a reinvention than the addition of a new skillset drum bass doyen marcus intalex has been turning in a stream of increasingly essential techno eps as for the last 18 months or so his third release under the name for martyns sees him further spread his 4/4 wings intalex (real name marcus kaye) has always had a way with an ominous bassline and that often makes itself felt on this ep not least on sprawling standout the track heaves and sways under the weight of its low frequencies as strung-out percussion and high synth sounds occupy its foreground opener builds with woozy synths and drowsy bass before eventually upping the ante through an insistent beat is described by martyn as a great nighttime highway driving track and its hard to argue with him the whole thing is bathed in warm pads over which high keys flit and scurry to create a hugely atmospheric whole digital-only bonus track pimlico starts out as an intense rumbling slab of doom-techno before the darkness is pierced by an almost pretty four-note synth line
beno t b is a french artist based in berlin whose appreciation for bright shimmering synths is only matched by the rich moods he can evoke with them his two releases on his own banlieue records (a project laurent garnier has taken an interest in) set the tone for the labels focus on hybrid relentless and hallucinogenic music the tracks were mostly driving trippy techno-inspired jams glazed with thick melody the exuberant ethos of which was described in titles like tough cheap nd real and electropolis is the first beno t b record not to appear on banlieue and its something of detour with three beatless tracks and two dance floor cuts the ep is the artists prettiest and most melody-focused work to date wraps its 4/4 kicks and busy tom patterns in layers of effervescent synth from the central loop to the countless harmonic flourishes and warm pads steady and strong as the beat is its really only there to carry you through beno t bs synthy ornamentation the darker uses parts of a heavy drum break to punctuate its clubby pulse while the swirl of arps rise and dissipate without ever losing their mystical tension both will go down nicely with djs looking for rhythm and melody in equal measure but that doesnt mean people should overlook the lush soundscapes of their counterparts with their hints of percussion and reliable structures and could bring even more moments of sublimity to the dance floor

return after their very successful outing with eastern promise which received airplay from sasha digweed as well as featuring on anthony pappas resolution cd on the a-side is the great beast a good solid kick from the outset and a great baseline are the features of this record early on there are constant eerie vocal effects the breakdown mid-way has a big room appeal with a muffled banging drum and a 1-toned string the track storms back in with a subtle melody definately suited to a big soundsystem on the flip we have the lesser beast which is essentially a dub that loses the big breakdown in the original but keeps the baseline and melody the beauty the beast is basically the ambient breakdown taken from the original and put on seperately for djs to use at their own peril it contains slight drums but no main kick
in the past have been champions of what you might call a grower : an album that doesnt hit you at first but gets better and better over time just think of kid a a record that made some fans indignant when it came out 11 years ago then eventually became a cult favorite this would normally make it seem unwise to critique their new album just a few days after its release after all the verdict could change after a few weeks or so but somehow that seems unlikely with king of limbs at just 37 minutes in length its not very much to take in more importantly its not ahead of the curve the same way its predecessors were king of limbs is one of s most challenging albums but also one of their least dynamic its dominated by angular jumbled beats which at times makes for uneasy listening yorke seems to acknowledge this with the somewhat threatening first line open your mouth wide delivered as always in his twisted groan indeed even yorkes voice never known for its soothing qualities seems especially grating here probably because its backed by such jagged arrangements but ultimately the effect is more drab than anything else have been much weirder before especially on amnesiac and kid a and then it was with verve and style here they sound stuffy by comparison without much range or emotional depth bands contemporary influences make a big impact on king of limbs fluttering beats echo flying s cosmogramma for which yorke did guest vocals anyone whos been keeping up with their office charts will have noticed a recent preference for funky and dubstep this seeps through most clearly on a 138 bpm track that would lend itself nicely to a remix by pearson sound or joy orbison all of this is well and good except that dont really improve on these sounds they just borrow them and its odd to see them taking cues from young artists rather than the other way around re are some good things to be said for king of limbs are obviously a visionary band and this isnt lost on the album entirely few artists would draw up something as unorthodox as or and execute it with such aplomb and some of the album is simply very pretty especially the single and the final track much of the musicianship is excellent (especially the drumming) and as usual the overall personality is unique and though not as varied as most of their past work the album follows an interesting arc starting out abrasive and growing more somber toward the end nonetheless its hard to imagine having a lasting relationship with any of these songs or getting excited when the band starts into them in concert and even if youre not expecting it to blow your mind its hard to shake the feeling that the album could have been more adventurous or failing that more engrossing are probably this generations best rock band king of limbs is their low water mark
who has released previously on poker flat and einmaleins takes aim at dark and menacing techno on this release there s a flat forward moving 4/4 beat with a pulsing bassline and atonal keys accompanied by looming atmospheric noises unfortunately despite aiming at dark and menacing what this actually achieves is murky and sludgy the heaviness of the production anchors one s feet firmly to the floor and the disparate parts of the track don t seem to link up to form a coherent groove the benedet remix trades in the rolling bassline for minimal percussion but the hats still feel heavy although the more sparing use of the atmospherics on this mix makes it marginally more successful
after a pretty solid first disc from and his wave depth ep the second disc features another original production from murat as well as another alican soner remix first up is formate drop and much like forever more on the first disc this track is quite an upbeat production again paced crisp beats open the track before a smooth baseline again gives the track a very solid flow and again much like the first disc the track takes a turn for the epic during the middle parts as deep synths come into the track as well as rippling melodies on the flip is the alican soner meets emrecan mix of forever more they again deliver a smooth production with good smooth beats throughout a very nice aura exists throughout most of the track but you cannot help but feel it lacks a certain cutting edge making it a track that will stand out above the rest essentially this release is quite solid but like the first disc it may lack a cutting edge that makes it truly stand out it is a good release however and it does have some fine moments
the riot which took place at the premiere of stravinskys ballet the rite of spring ( ) in paris 1913 remains one of the greatest scandals in music history while such a reception seems incomprehensible by todays jaded world-weary audiences the savage rhythms and violent dissonance of the composition still retain the power to awe helping it become arguably the most important widely performed piece of 20th century composition ts logical that a piece so centred on rhythm should spark the interest of dance music producers but that it has resulted in so subtle an edit by none other than proto-progressivist stefan goldmann is indeed a surprise the only hint of an interest in classical music d noticed in goldmann was the choir which gorgeously rears up in lunatic fringe but his edit of the rite reveals a studied thorough understanding not just of classical music structure but more significantly of the classical recording industry taking twelve different recordings of the work goldmann performed 146 cuts remaining faithful to the score throughout as goldmann describes it: every couple of seconds you find yourself in a different room listening to a different orchestra under a different conductor a journey through microphone positions and mixdown decisions each time a different world in the headphone goldmann then is in essence some sort of perry-esque dub-engineer-prankster here exposing the imperfection-masking invisible edits of which the classical recording industry is so dependent celebrating the unique atmospheres of individual recording sessions and almost consequently introducing a beloved classical icon to new audiences a ferry corsten trance mix of adagio for strings this aint except that goldmanns approach is so minimally invasive that his edits are often as difficult to detect as those of the industry he critiques actual cuts are inaudible and the variations between performances or rather between recording sessions are barely discernible even through headphones his restraint is admirable and its an intriguing concept there is some fun to be had in spotting the change in bassoons in the opening bars or the fluctuations in tape hiss which occur throughout but its an alienating academic exercise and soon seems rather pointless much better to submit and get carried away by the music the strongest moments of which remain immune to goldmanns scalpel dance of the adolescents is as shocking and revelatory as ever and goldmanns cutting here relatively dramatic goes by unnoticed the lasting effect goldmanns editing produces is one of dehumanisation and objectivity the artifice of recording foregrounded and this version if it can be compared against real ones feels uniquely cold the contribution of individual performers and the relative value of different performances (the basis for all classical music appreciation and criticism) become meaningless leaving only an indifferent rendering of stravinskys score this may well have been goldmanns intention but ll take pierre monteuxs untouched 1957 recording included here any day ronically after all these levels of detachment it is stravinsky whose voice remains
less an ep more a mini album former instra:mental man damon kirkham presents an impressive lineup of guests for his new vinyl only zero series its kirkham himself in his guise who kicks things off features s heavily treated vocals devilish and threatening on a skeletal aggressive track its a half stepping stomp with drums that thud like anti aircraft fire and frantic acidic patterns brief and somewhat maudlin s benefit is twisted glacial alt hip hop ussie producer best known for his releases for sydney techno mavens motorik lays down some oppressive synths and military snares to counteract s breathy bats for lashes style vocals takes a more melodic approach on his second offering ; in fact the rattling synth wobble that snakes through record isnt a million miles away from trance so much so when the track makes way for s contribution its something of a shock to the system ndy graham has a way with rude acid basslines and is no exception pounding beat like cops knocking at your front door merely adds to the feeling of unease like graham j has been on a roll in recent months and his rollicking all reversed synths and squeaking uk garage vocals is possibly the collections best submission s an ep its uneven in places but thats understandable given the breadth of talent on show
it doesnt really require much of an explanation as to why and are a good pairing this is the third of four in the series of singles and leaves s vocal track nearly untouched her voice is captivating as usual with lyrics about listening to crystals grow and other metaphors for the quirky lasss emotional epiphanies s backing track is inventive and pretty constructed from a jangling bag of coloured glass spheres distorted growls decorate the kicks rather than push them at you and the way the whole thing bounces is odd but persuasively dance-y there are gentle chord changes in the plinks and plonks of the backing track which make an easy kind of sense but it would be more compelling if it progressed somewhere more challenging and emotional nevertheless this remix is an ornament: halfway between pleasant and lovely and with plenty of detail and intrigue to keep you engaged
black nobility of venice and genoa is the second vinyl on surface ltd a sub-label of londons surface records and it comes to us from italian producer perhaps better known as obtane while i wasnt impressed with the recent obtane remix on psychoskunk here under his own name baudazzi expands on the techno hes recently crafted on sonic groove and with giorgio gigli on zooloft and keeps things interesting over the course of five (relatively) short tracks on the a-side c a m e a and surface boss 65d edit of dei each have grinding off-beat riffs that tumble in and out of the mix both should find favor with obtane fans but i think the b-side is more appealing overall shows baudazzi at his best leading listeners headlong down dark horror film hallways that pulse with sinister energies its not all doom and gloom though: airy tones sustained in the middle and high ranges of (which features fellow italian artist dino sabatini) smoothly counteract that tracks serrated underside and the levitating percussion and evocative chords of much like the ambient bliss-outs that emerge from zooloft on occasion offer fleeting but definitive proof that theres still room for romance in baudazzis futuristic world of sound
matt flanagan is an electro heads electro producer the kind that releases on niche labels catered to people who like exactly that kind of music the second ep on rob booths fledgling label is easily his most prominent record yet and its got a more accessible sound to go with the territory is all about the bassline its a concrete base for the throbbing distorted percussion and its got one hell of a hook too theres an unusual amount of space in which is mainly to make way for a metalic chord progression the track fuses techno aesthetics with drexciya-style synth blasts groove is paramount on and the butt-wiggling style is a direct contrast to the more abrasive elements that make up these tracks its most apparent on which smooths out a searing acid line with an easygoing house strut the excellent ep is rounded off with a brief diversion into wispy ambience that shows off the other aspects of flanagans range
on weathered straight (likely to be the only cosmic r b/future garage ep from an australian indie-rocker youll hear this month) what lacks in innovation he makes up for by delivering four sweet-natured downbeat vocal numbers indulges in too much burialism on its womb-like vocals but its half-march of loping beats and throbbing melody just about holds your attention on he mixes machinedrum-style synths with soupy sundown electronica la washed out vao is a rather too brief bout of ambient dream pop before the pitch-shifted vocals and whiffs of chillwave return on as a first foray into electronica weathered straight is just shy of promising but theres enough here to suggest that if murdoch finds his voice he could head somewhere interesting

helena hauffs debut came on ctresss werkdiscs and her second release follows on an equally acclaimed label: a collaboration with fellow golden pudel resident f x isnt markedly different from hauffs solo ep but it imbues her rickety techno with a brighter disposition while remaining within the realm of analogue fetishism pits vintage electro melodies against an overcooked kick drum and high-pitched shrieks on first glance its a simple (and satisfying) hardware jam but the chugging acid line that belches from beneath and just barely surfaces shows the kind of detail the duo can generate with their equipment it sounds like theyre juggling elements on the fly trying to keep their machinery running while an occasional burst of noise reminds us that there are humans at work for all its crooked edges is catchy and even more so like a lost oni yhun outtake the overdriven drums and sizzling handclaps are a bed of hot coals for the lead to dance on as it heats up to its scuzzy climax we already know the golden pudel residents are gifted djs these two tracks show theyre just as promising as producers
brooklyn synth pop newcomer s first ep evinces the kind of tune sense youd associate with the young kate bush with a similarly windswept romanticism yet halo buries things sometimes completely: at her ep release show in brooklyn recently she used the microphone primarily to thank us for coming instead of songs we got blobs of often pretty and always busy sound king felix is a different animal altogether the words can be hard to make out a lot of the time theres a lot of echo on this recording for starters and the mood seems to be more the thing than the narratives per se theres a real surge during when the dry high synths start whirling and then halo tops them with a billowing chorus that climaxes and she will never die-ie-ie (the glacial drone of oneohtrix s remix suggests that rather than death she chose deep freeze ) she gets that kind of effect a few times here the fast-stepping hook of has a slipperiness that matches its dazed and dazzled icy synth baubles; similarly the arrangement of is full of beguilingly flat-sounding synth tones like approximated reed instruments that grounds halos loop-de-loop melody im intrigued to hear where she goes next

s casts off the mesmerizing effect of three different tracks each slightly stilted tumbling into one another by accident and linking together into something as surprisingly funky as it is gangly and weird pieces themselves arent so distinguished a contemplative bassline workaday snares some extremely clipped hi-hats but carolas handling of them is impressive in particular as he starts to pull certain segments out shift stuff around and slowly twist different parts until they turn into gently morphed refractions of what was there before its all subtle and decidedly less than flashy but a lot more gets done in six minutes here than in many tracks twice as long two remixes by martin follow one a remix and the other the remix first rolls along over a bit of a broken-beat march with a wooden bend to it all and a deft mix of organic and synthesized sounds that makes the track much bigger and brighter plus a good bit beachier remix tightens up and moves through a good techno tease with a beat that hits big when it drops and a zoned-out sense of ease that gets better as it rolls along
searching for something that little bit different and yet instantly recognisable the third release on the impressive label makes all the right noises in the right order and still has surprises up its sleeve is great not merely because it makes sexual moaning sound fresh and new but also because of the high-pitched siren and dampened bottom end that sound like a humid night in los angeles pushes all the right disco buttons and never puts a foot wrong evocative and uplifting in equal measure its a masterclass in restraint and delicacy adds to the ominous ambience created by occupying another level with its glitchy touches and haunting backing vocals it manages to be energetic and soporific at the same time uses a crystalline synth line to invoke decay and effortlessly conjures up a world collapsing in on itself with a harmonic low end and not for the first time on this release a stimulating use of the disembodied voice deep as you like but with funk in spades need i say more
salt spring island is the jewel of british columbias gulf islands its historically been a place of refuge most recently for draft dodgers fleeing the us during the vietnam war now salt spring is a granola hippie outpost and a haven for artists a leafy getaway immersed in nature but still accessible from the larger centres around it this is where youre me recorded their debut album and you can hear salt spring in its unfussy grooves babbling like a backyard creek the tape is among the more striking releases on in some time combining the labels love of relaxing new age and ambient with the vancouver region it calls home youre me is yu su and scott johnson gailey two emerging vancouver artists su in addition to being a great dj and crate digger made her production debut earlier this year with an album of fogged-up grooves for genero gailey is part of juniper systems a house act that also made a recent production debut the pair even each other out sus meandering is grounded by gaileys percussive sensibilities while she works to space out his rhythms their record isnt for the dance floor nor is it entirely downtempo or ambient its more like a pastoral take on the deep techno of silent season a label that reflects the gorgeous natural landscape of british columbia the first half of plays with percussive templates ilu is marked by sus typically heatsick style: the gentle drums hang together loosely rattling around like loose pebbles on the duo mix misty morning pads with a broken dub techno beat and on they nervously approach the dance floor the tracks percolating rhythm lunges forward as if the producers couldnt keep hold of it that quality is one of the most appealing aspects of youre me theres an unpolished simplicity to how they write songs with elements that poke out of the mix the rough basslines on almost upend the otherwise peaceful feeling; boxy drums beat underneath the drizzle of pounding some shape into it such elements make feel more purposeful than a collection of impromptu jams on however the slowly deflating outro catches the ear more than the heavier beat-driven passages youre me are strongest at their most relaxed and they dole out melody with a short attention span like theyre daydreaming as they play take : the dubby waves of sound feel like theyre washing right through your fingers on other songs like alled su and gailey tap into a zen mindset that feels native to the pacific northwest its a pleasantly droning compositional style that the duo share with local acts like loscil where expansive chords and enveloping drums are paired with deep earthy rhythms so much of the music from this area is inextricable from its surroundings and youre me is no different

hes only been around for a couple of years but young german roland m dill has already become a firm partner of having released all of his material though the label or ltd its no surprise as his skippy minimal-inflected tech house that throws drumbeats liberally off the mark to unexpectedly create unfeasible amounts of groove is right at home on the club-functional label however is one of his most pounding yet in going this route he sacrifices some of the quirkiness from the likes of last years baked potato to make room for the straightforward growling bass and repetitiveness of the synth shrieks which bore straight through your cranium thats not to say it doesnt have personality: the grainy choppiness of his drums are still there and still pretty unique the playful inventiveness and value is mostly on the b-sides though with being a bouncy number that might evoke silly dancing and the most individualistic thing here on that latter track a psychedelic rhythmic mash of what sounds like randomly chosen samples drums or otherwise churns underneath sci-fi ambience and spacey reverbed bell noises harvey slides the meter from tech house further towards techno with a darker dub mix sizzling with circuit bent sounds and broken speaker hoots his non-dub remix meanwhile keeps the prominent two-note riff and storms ahead taking the original to its logical hard-ass conclusion
while i cant tell you much about other than he purports to be an essex lad s concept is so roundly executed that we learn something about him title references vantablack a substance so dark that it absorbs 99 965 of visible light ( blackest artificial substance known the sculptor anish kapoor is the only person to whom its been licensed for artistic use ) as such we can interpret to mean the blankest ever blank stare fully parse the implications visit the web installation vantablank-stare u-i-q org where youll see digital renderings of empty 24-hour news desks with a running news feed available in english russian and arabic headlines deliver sarcastic commentary on our relationship with media today visuals by hutchins himself and design of the site are great but its the music keeps you there you can listen to the full ep this way although without properly experiencing the final locked groove on the vinyl (on mp3 its a gentle 30-second dub riddim that youll have to put on repeat ) tracks and are the showstoppers both crackle and lash like an electricity line downed from its pylon first sounds like the aftershocks of some drum bass dystopia while the latter is like a survivor excavating a dub techno meltdown middle track gives us a momentary rest on a hazy ambient drift political intelligent and ambitious is an auspicious introduction to an intriguing new talent
fter the acclaimed release of the london zoo album last year the bug k kevin martin has evidently been working hard on other projects is the first to hit wax in longside writer/spoken word performer roger robinson theyve produced a work of echoing precussion thats driven by thick rolling basslines and the sort of groove that massive ttack brought to mainstream attention in its earliest days has an nertia creeps bassline that keeps propelling its constant surges deep into the belly of the track sloshing around in tape delay and theremin melodics whilst rolls out heavily reverbed snares and distant sirens sticking to a more hip-hop template as the heavy bass pumps its five notes in succession is the peach though; a drawn out roller that travels through extended periods of sustain and chorus whilst the muted thump of the kick drum keeps the tempo regulated in a 4x4 style ncessantly moody its a release best played at the loudest volume possible revealing all the layers and clicks that are poured into the heavily stylised sound design the atmosphere created over the course of the 12-inch whether vibing off a crackling piano or a massive bassline piles the reams of sickly sweet weed smoke it emanates into the dark vacumn it creates
french producer seems to have a preoccupation with detroit which doesnt exactly set him apart what does make (sisters nd rothers) worth your time though is not only its pitch-perfect replication of what makes motor city techno so irresistible but how it easily meshes different detroit styles its classic sounding in a lot of ways theres an aquatic arpeggio that could inhabit the drexciya universe as well as foreboding pads and fuzzy bump that check the electro boxes that is until it jumps off the deep end into soulful detroit house organ stabs and all s it vacillates between its two modes feels like a combination that shouldnt work but pulls it off chicago duo innerspace put a spacey take on the track they add a throbbing dub beat that skips and wobbles while smearing the organ notes into the background more out-there than s traditional-leaning sounds
is set to make his mark with his colombian tribe ep on the tweek d imprint with support already from the likes of erick morillo danny tenaglia and junior vasquez in particular it appears that william already has a few admirers with this release i m listening is first up and unfortunately i am not too big an admirer of this production in parts the track is quite solid with some good solid drum rhythms and throbbing baseline but for the me the track lacks a cutting edge throughout that makes it extra special emergency ep is perhaps a little better with some solid beats yet again and a very nice chunky baseline that drives nicely along it is quite a moody production thanks to some quirky vocal effects and a warped stabbing effect that takes control midway in not a bad release at all but it perhaps is just missing something a little extra
for all of the talk of a dubstep-techno convergence there are very few dubstep djs that actually put much four-to-the-floor material into their own sets its not surprising that a straight beat might not be of much interest to breakbeat believers one of the few who has found room in their crates for the stuff is ppleblim who teams up here on his own pplepips imprint with fellow dubstep producer ramadanman to craft an effortless bit of bass pressure isnt among the duos best work by any means but its still a distinctive track that does its job with more flair than your average 140 pm roller the rotating melody that barges into the proceedings halfway through makes sure of that much nd the duos innate sense of songcraft is obvious from the off ppleblims love affair with the straighter stuff gets an airing on the as will and team up for a remix of the title track perhaps the most interesting stuff is placed up front: the duo effectively meander a bit working out a way to blast through the murk with the indelible melody that ppleblim and ramadanman have given them once they do things get sorted quickly and the two ride the hook through to tracks end with some light offbeats to keep things interesting simultaneously functional and fascinating its among the best work thus far in the nascent genre and a perfect track to help further bridge the gap in adventurous dj sets
n the last year or two new yorks balasanov best known for releasing old school-style house on labels like future times and mathematics has shifted to less traditional blueprints the moscow-born artist grew up in chicago and though the citys musical legacy remains an influence on his work hes also moved on from classic house in favor of one of its modern descendents: footwork last years soft control his debut for daniel lopatins imprint brought a tender new dimension to footwork combining its raunchy sexuality and dj spinns sentimental soul perhaps because balasanov is an outsider to chicagos actual footwork scene the style of his music is hard to pin down for one thing the tracks that make up (and soft control for that matter) are not strictly 160 bpm in fact only one track sits at that tempo perhaps because of this the song is an easy highlight ts also about as romantic as footwork gets with stumbling toms that underpin a woozy synthesizer and come-hither vocal whispers balasanov aims for the dance floor at several points throughout s and seem as indebted to new orleans rap as they are to anything chicagoan is similarly outrageous if less overtly sexual with an old school ny/nj house organ as a hook the sparse high-speed jack of is intuitive as hell at least before it accelerates beyond the point of normal body response but the album truly peaks on a pair of emotional epics the frisky shuffle of is melded with aching reverberating organ hyperspeed vocal stutters and nosediving square waves while the ambient tips a hat to lopatins eohtrix point never both create a sense of drama that arches over the rhythm tracks and lends them extra purpose roots may lie in footwork but balasanov sounds liberated from genre specifics where many similar hybrids are too cerebral or schizophrenic his album is impressively tactile and laced with a genuinely passionate pulse
theres not much use in reviewing the ep it more deserves explaining once upon a time there were three producers named luke solomon rob mello and zaki d they liked house music particularly the kind made by chez damier and ron trent on records one thing led to another and the trio of producers created two tracks put them out and the three producers (collectively known as heaven earth in this instance) became so popular on their own that they never really worked together again aside from a remix of eau mot plage here or a re-rub of red nails i think of you there then came gerd janson house music connoisseur and records proprietor he loved the tracks and approached the trio and got the rights to reissue the recordrand even finagled an unreleased re-edit of one ( and ) giving vinyl collectors reason to pick up the new version the end thats the short version nd for house music lovers its probably not all that enlightening ut what more can you say when confronted with a record like a tune famously caned by carl craig on his 1995 essential mix its guitar-led house beat makes you want to scream even before that lady comes in and tells us the title or when the unyielding piano line of and is the only thing left before the beat flies back in to flatten you ep is a classic dj tool that should be in any self-respecting jocks collection and even makes for mighty nice home listening as well

with the movement towards the use of electronic electro and generally techy sounds in house music its no surprise to see house and techno coming closer and closer together djs like danny howells and carl cox have been doing this for a while as has producer (dutchman peter gijselaers) both under his own name and as one half of dirtcrew here on traum sub label the side opens up with a decidedly techno kick quickly joined by a simple repetitive but funky plucked loop and some techno hats meanwhile backspin effects rising background strings and a bouncey delayed bell loop provide the main motif quite pushing in its nature this track has energy in its percussion and several dynamic elements (like the little acid line) and a tangible but slightly ethereal feel to its melodies enhanced overall by an occasional lush synth wash perhaps one for later in the night then mix) on the side starts with gossamer strings and plucked notes like the interlude in some hong kong grade demons acrobatics and wires flick just before said demons close in for the big show down fortunately its actually a lovely intro before the track immediately heads into less heavenly waters with a compelling dirty bassline and tight catchy guitar hook overlaid with a couple of tightly looped soft pads and punctuated at key points with urgency building stabs breathy voices both angelic and primitive and just a touch of acid this track has a lot going for it ll the components work really well together making for a groovy and mysterious atmosphere this would be magic for a deeper crowd already in the thick of things top work
the promise that surrounded ryan bonfield at the time of his breaking through piece last year feels fully realised on the way it do and we trapped what sets the bristol producers melting-pot approach apart from some of his uk bass contemporaries is clarity: this is no murky mix of clashing styles take the way it do the rhythm track is pure upfront house with a cascading bassline to that straps crashing resonant techno beats and then joins the dots with wobbly garage vocals zed bias wub-wub bass drops and skippy tambourines bonfields love of footwork rears its head in the rimshot pings and monstrous asymmetrical percussion that stretches across we trapped in the hands of mancunian producer damu the way it do morphs into an aural assault of machine gun low-end synth and sparse metronome clicks a techno/bass colossus delivered with an exuberant snarl

if daft punk are the godfathers of both the original filtered french touch sound and the recent paris-centric maximalist blog-house scene then quentin dupieux aka the elusive mr oizo is their drunken wife-beating libidinous uncle: you can never tell in what state he is going to show up at the family reunion and youre not sure you would want to be seen in public with him but you know the party would definitely not be the same without him if the recent dali/bunuel-inspired promo and artwork for are any indication oizos third official long player should have more to do with surrealistic collages than the heavily processed synth pads ed banger his new home is best known for on (nice title) and upcoming single were treated with offbeat samples that might or might not have been jazzy tunes or underground soul anthems in another life: these tracks are irreverent in their mixture of genres and textures but theyre also fun to actually bust a move to coming from oizo a producer more known for his abrasiveness than for his immediacy ( moustache and nazis anyone ) this is an improvement worth noticing this renewed sense of purpose is even more apparent on a collaboration with ed bangers own female prot g e on which repetitive handclaps quirky bongos and just a few background bleeps makes for pop music at its experimental best even more surprising the entire thing works very well as an album the title track (allegedly recorded by flat eric himself) and might have more in common with musique concr te than actual french electro but theyre both welcomed skits standing very well next to and the only two pieces remotely reminiscent of the trickeries of sebastian or justice then you have is and both version of (french for rotting stuff ) three tracks that are so dumb and populist they wouldnt sound out of place playing in remote alaskan hockey arenas between games (a privileged status only ombie nations kernkraft 400 and gary glitters rock n roll have been given so far) in other words its euro-cheese stripped of all its irritating nutrients but with its expeditious feel still intact in a surprising twist of events then it turns out is oizos most intelligible offering ever and ed bangers most fulfilling long player thus far edgy yet consistent odd yet easy to embrace its electronic music youd kill to have your drunken wife-beating libidinous uncle dance to at upcoming christmas parties
you have to be step-on-glass cautious in throwing the word progressive around in dance circles but have a tendency to craft within the brainier elements of the term while slimming its bloat with a background in trance as midi miliz and also spirallianz s arne schauffhausen and wayan raabe are certainly not strangers to thick blitzkrieg techno music while s past singles for labels like border community and traum have seen the duo use the name for more refined tech-house creations the duos never completely shed the dark-corridor depths of their past a welcome balance of those strains s debut album sch ne neue aint sunday breakfast fare flirting with the psychedelic ends of the spectrum without ever resorting to the lobotomizing or cheap libido typically associated with trance techno perhaps the first thing you notice about sch ne neue is its remarkable cohesion despite its myriad tempo-changes and sonic outfits shaped from over twenty-five available tracks the duo picked the twelve that worked best in concert and the result is yet another commendable full-length that dance music rarity on the back of minilogues animals for cocoon not so much inky as boarded-window black with dead light cutting in only on the edges sch ne neue makes extraordinary use of space without ever really getting quiet or slow; it seems to move as a whole with an innate understanding of just how much time and what energy resources it needs to leave for its completion fact are damn cagey in how they calculate momentum without succumbing to coarse peak-time madness or too much mid-tempo footdragging twinkles and chimes like coins dropped down an aluminum slide as its shifting synthetic strings usher in a steady beat while is jumpier with subtle creepy boc-like melodies wavering between the speakers has an ascending-descending staircase quality to its movement hectic and cluttered in comparison to most of the album but held in place by a great lockstep groove fans of past singles like soopertrack for example will be happy to know the albums steeped in the long-form lunar escapes as well of is best illuminated by the light thats missing as buried analogue tones set a foundation for shy melodies that seem to fade when they catch you listening with bells like carbonated bubbles rising mixed into an increasingly sturdy backdrop makes for simple pleasures out of relatively economical elements tr mmerfeld too shares that sense of slow-moving shadows but sounds more corrosive and jaded like the edges were scorched a little but in may be the real stunner with ambient tones soon crimpled by fx and buried-cable bass resemble the field working in a black icestorm instead of blinding snow a rare moment where the duo gives into the simple stark charms of atmosphere

danish artist tobias lee swims in the same stream as total freedom and the janus crew he views electronic music as a potentially destructive force against the status quo and does almost nothing conventionally from his djing to the way he releases music his footprint so far consists of a series of off-kilter sometimes abrasive mixes plus bootlegs and unofficial edits released virally as he puts it is an important milestone in his career: it marks both the first time hes tried his hand at original productions and his first official ep released by rabits new label like many of his colleagues lees music is a chaotic confluence of styles house ballroom jersey club ambient and noise all have their place on and sometimes all at once is the standout if just for its simplicity its a wobbly house track with some spiraling marimbas and a hissing bassline that sounds borrowed from emptyset the real star is the hi-hat: wet and wooshy it moves with this odd ethereal grace the clever lo-fi touch makes all the more bewildering theres an equally soggy feel to a bass-heavy clatter that seems built out of wet cardboard is a ballroom-influenced number using hi-hats a different way here they sound sharp enough to slice your head off keeping time in a hectic backdrop that includes layered ha stabs and chimes (fans of rizzlas recent ep take note) is rounded off with a rumbling ambient number that instils more dread than calm it has background details and an atmospheric quality that are less obvious in the harder tunes coming in between the thumpers also gives the four-tracker a lopsided feel albeit one that points towards lees great potential
joining the lofty ranks of riri li-lo and subo are two producers with similarly astronomic status within the dance scene in which they operate ricardo villalobos and roman fl gel villalobos of course is known more for his meticulously detailed spidery percussion and fl gel more for straightforward hooks thats fairly generally what weve got here with each feature sliding towards the direction of the other producer while features splintered percussion its more straight and mechanical than a lot of the chileans stuff and the pattering piano is a hook but has nothing on something like gehts noch both tracks meander through a grab bag of noises ranging from the minute to the mildly substantial theres no sense of purpose just a gentle evolution the way the sounds are sprinkled delicately over the drum tracks give a helium lightness that only adds to this detachment combined with the sparse steely tech of the drums and heavy undercurrent on it adds up to a floppy yet driving groove that would probably do very nicely in the club but probably not set the floor on fire seems slower due to a 2-step inflected plod; its less frantic and more dubby it points toward warm-up territory a more obvious place for this kind of limbo overall though is a single which sounds like two producers working with a mutual respect for their common ground; good but not quite the sum of its parts

even though is third studio album it kinda feels like their first 2008s are gee gee fazzi (part i and ii) was handed out for free at gigs and 2009s disko drunkards came as a covermount cd for dj mag readers twisting the industrys distribution rules is a noble thing but it unfortunately gave the actual releases a semi-official half-baked aura (a move only made more puzzling by the fact have been running their own label the eternally reliable eskimo recordings for more than a decade now) whereas the 2008/09 material emphasized the duos musics livelier side recalling the heterosexual disco of lcd soundsystem or the icy disco-not-disco of playgroup/trevor jackson is an overall more electronic affair now signed to you can discern the distant gaze of new stablemates munk and telonius all over the nine tracks collected here its as effervescent discoid and punchy as anything the munich-based label has released this year at first a song like does exactly what it says on the tin by emulating boney m-like horns funk but it perverts the entire thing midway through with acidic motifs a trick also repeated on the title track and on and meanwhile both come across as beefier and more structured takes on the sort of bearded norwegian dance eskimo followers know so well the duo productions arent always so focused though: cbeebies is an impressionistic jam that is fx-laden with echoes and warped effects but without a noticeable hook is the mandatory slower album-closing cut that recalls ray mangs take on nu-balearica (e g his look to eyes cut on dfa earlier this year) word to the wise as well: if you thought the consistent use of cowbells as a percussive tool would have grown tiresome by now this isnt the album for you but overall seem galvanized this time by the all-out energetic bootlegs they produced under the buffalo jams moniker and compiled earlier this year for a first official album reeks of panache and bravado
whats perhaps most impressive about gunnar wendels music is that no matter where he takes his machines brittle 140+ bpm wigglers stoney roland porn big room catharsis for introverted deep house heads hes equally playing to his strengths and going out on a limb for this guy the two impulses are deeply intertwined very few producers have been given license to cover so much ground as the man we call and few have been able to deliver on the promise of sounding simultaneously like everyone and no one as i sit here in anticipation of writing about mosses latest i wonder whats left to say about this guys tunes but as long as he keeps recording music as effortlessly unexpected as the four tracks on offer here i doubt nerds like me will have trouble finding the words a good one to start with is effortless : not one track on sounds all that much like the next and yet they all derive from the same well-developed strain of paranoia the title cut feels bored but not really in a bad way: pacing back and forth unsteadily pitched snaps and a foot-tapping kick pass the time until a simply funky shaker arrives and gets things started in earnest steps into the party with its eyes already rolled pretty far back in its head requiring an array of little cymbal hits to poke and prod its low moan to keep it conscious on the flip things get a bit pricklier theres very little congruous melody to be found on but the irregular rhythms and wisps of color fit together like skin and knife continuing in the steppin vein of 7am from his recent musical generics 7-inch casually steals the show hollowing out drexciya and hessle audio but declining to fill in the holes this release shows the world of growing ever more twisted and unexpected a seemingly improbable feat but one weve grown to expect
the latest album from tobias freund aka tobias is a refinement of the german artists recent work s/t an album he made last year with the chilean visual artist valentina berthelon under the name recent arts merged synthetic sound and field recordings into loops programmed to avoid repetition another record from last year helium sessions wrapped irregular grooves in dense atmospheres though resembles the gaseous techno of his last 12-inch it also seems inspired by s/t s theme of steady evolution it edges away from previous tobias full-lengths in distinct ways one of which is suggested by the albums title sounds that support rhythm and melody hi-hats ambient tones are often the focus on album directs our gaze to the sounds beneath the sounds so that they surface in the same way an image might from a magic eye puzzle freund has a well-established reputation for sound design his solo productions techno tracks whether experimental or dance floor-driven favour space and precision over brute strength is a close-up of this style slender layers of drone synths and vocals undulate beneath chugging hi-hats on whose kick-snare combination seems blurred by freunds atmospheric haze on drums and vocals are arranged in a panorama toms descend from left to right and the sample of the late chilean philosopher francisco valera splits into segments across the sound field disjunctive tones on sometimes gather in clusters but the plaintive harmony is where freund draws our ears s details are commendably creative but the intensity of freunds gaze has an undesirable side effect album has a habit of drifting by on previous tobias albums melodies and vocal loops in addition to being catchy were useful punctuation marks energy drains down the gaps that appear in place of those devices on s opening half s one-note lead for example is too delicate to pull you from the wispy lull of the albums first three tracks s cycling notes and rasping chords give the album an adrenaline shot but only once the album lingers on another sleepy section the mechanised grind of and the solemn ambient of freund once said that his tracks always emerged from experiments not concepts only concept is that i want to make a club track he told resident advisor in 2013 does however claim to draw from a concept: autopoiesis the name for a self-sustaining and reproducing system in chemistry and biology a cell for example (it is argued that techno as a rhythm that keeps rolling has similar principles ) but the album is more engaging when freund revisits tried and tested methods has a lot in common with other cuts on but a bassline and coiled arps usher the tracks subtler aspects moody strings booms of thunder into a transportive space closing title track reshapes freunds dance floor techno in the albums illusory style re are string harmonies piano chords and soulful vocals but all of them are hard to discern behind the bells and claps beneath freunds silky ambient veils the musics most compelling elements are hard to make out
it wouldnt be fair to mention ithaca new yorks young without first saying something about goth crunk merchants salem both rely on the same lugubrious slow-mo formula of pitched-down vocals pitched-up vocals heavy bass drums and spooky echoes of three 6 mafia burial boards of canada and dead can dance is s first release and its a little less glum than salems king night but all the more ghostly its opener is a dream skittering over an underproduced bassline and a bizarre vocal phrase that couldve been culled from an old goblin soundtrack haunted tokyo synth-clatter rises and fades somewhere in the middle were met with dizzied glossolalia and chopped-up samples of a riverside (think green river killer in this case not a babbling brook ) there is a question that comes with much like king night is this stuff simply part of electronic musics long catalog of ephemera soon to go back through the hazy club fog and into post-boom obscurity much like the explosion of electroclash a few years back witch house has relied more on its aesthetic than its instrumentation or method of production at least until this point trip-hop came about similarly born with a surreal night mood taking cues from early 90s hip-hop and we all know where that ended up plays slowly toward the end of its title is quite accurate: there are chipmunk verses what sounds like a woman panting; the kick the snare water samples move along the woozy chords here again to imply a theme this ends and the final track starts spray-can hisses of soft noise begin and a male voice groans singing something deathly toward the end there is an arpeggio we hear a bright chord a quicker tempo perhaps we see birds
cid test a sub-label of l s shows a different side of the 303 with help from recondite donato dozzy and arguably its flagship artist it has suppressed acid houses clich d frenzy into more nuanced melancholy but after more than ten releases and two near-perfect albums the sad-acid thing was starting to wear thin the latest lp from is the first cid test release not to focus so heavily on the 303 here those lonely synths are just another part of s broader palette which has grown paler and more steely real name johannes uvinen eases us into this change with the fluttering dub chords of and the techno sheet metal of where before his kick drums functioned mostly as pillars propping up his songs here the rhythms have a different slant theres the powerful march of or the stunning whose swirling strings and synth washes sound like a greyed-out dusky record the cd version of comes with four vocal versions that recall the era of scared and vienna blue the otherwise bouncy deep house of suddenly has a heavy-lidded languor while memorophilia and have uvinen mumbling in a barely audible baritone these extra tunes bridge the gap between the two sides of which have otherwise remained stubbornly separate more importantly they make his vocals palatable no longer quivering in centre stage his voice sounds right at home lurking in the nether-regions of his instrumentals that sense of balance and synthesis makes uvinens most well-rounded album especially if you grab the version with the vocal tracks it captures the after-the-rave state of mind in a way thats more direct than say the aural illusions of lee gamble which explore a similar sound manages introspection while still holding on to the part of the night that makes your head rush and your heart flutter
despite their differing sounds marc houle and m s kittin both seem to have a passion for glitchy alternative techno having left minus in 2011 to start items things with magda and troy pierce houles minimal-driven sound has since developed into something more full-bodied paving the way for a collaboration alongside the french electroclash queen title track sounds exactly as youd imagine from these two: thumping kicks and crashing claps sit beneath kittins signature tw ted vocals with eerie synths later joining the party though far from dull it does come across as a little forced to call dubfires interpretation a remix would be too much credit: the sci + tec boss merely extends the original by four minutes and ra es the bpm m s kittins shecago refix also lacks innovation simply sharpening the claps and dropping into the occasional low-slung breaks interlude john are slightly more adventurous replicating kittins vox in gruff male form while attaching driving electro synths for a grittier texture salvaging the release a track repetitive to the point of hypnotic whose throbbing bassline and stuttered wh pers induce an ambient trance
cosmin nicolaes career hasnt exactly been easy to follow with the romanian producer moving from straightforward dubstep on subway to predicting the 2-step revival and inaugurating hessle udio to making uk bass-compatible house music on rush hour to be fair the results have been almost universally excellent barring a slight misstep here and there his latest chameleonic transformation has him solidifying his techno turn on modeselektors often brutalist label move towards erghain techno might be clich at this point but nicolaes take on it is refined and spacious dressing up old bleep techno in modernized scaffolding polishes up its chunky foundation with incisive chords and synths that disintegrate and rain down in goopy washes these kind of night slugs-esque melodic runs transplanted into such an austere setting are captivating breaking up the monotony over the tracks six minutes is like a stylized hnert banger frenzied chords fighting to rush past each other through harsh panning and a rush of dulled hi-hats s techno isnt trendy but built lovingly from the ground-up with the kind of nuance and idiosyncratic flourishes that can only come from someone who seems to be making a career out of toying with conventions
it has been said that l a s the was the answer to uk s the chemical brothers one of the pioneers of american underground techno music ken jordan and scott kirkland have been keeping hope alive since the 90 s with their anathematic pieces of music that have gone beyond the raves electronic nightclubs and dance festivals into mainstream media at a time where alternative rock was dwindling and bubblegum pop music was hailing its return the moby prodigy and dj rap were leading the way for mainstream audiences to discover a new wall of sound already respected amongst the underground scene the pars first long-player vegas created a storm of unparallel proportions as television film and interactive media were licensing tracks off it and propelling the duo into stardom now after 8 years from the first release the instrumentals that heavily influenced the debut album progresses into full-on collaborations between rappers rock stars and a supermodel to form a lavish hybrid of sound to appeal to both fans of trendy electronica and to the hardcore for the majority of echoes of the method s signature style of breakbeat and big beat unleashes rapidly from left-to-right with multiply screening of friends to assist the foundation to what embodies rapper rahzel leads the pack with three while limp bizkit s former lead guitarist wes borland contributes his low-n-high end of devastating riffs followed closes by ska-key and lisa; while john garcia and milla jovovich appears only once (which the latter i was disappointed to see that she only appears once while rahzel and borland combine for six) the introduction that begins the album is a seminal opener starting over builds slowly and surely i believed that somehow the have grown up; and then it hits me and it hits me hard as the first single born too slow shops up a slick and dirty guitar riff courtesy of wes borland; thrashing beats and the raw vocals of john garcia race the track deeper and heavier as the seconds run by the album jump-starts very early with massive influence with heavy heavy metal theatrics the percussive channel that is recognized on the american way sees rahzel donating the first of his three-part donation to the rahzel one of hip hops most amazing beat-boxers and free forming lyricist shows here rapping about the american way he somehow throws in a joke about american idol the gem of the album belongs to supermodel/actress/musician milla jovovich who continues to blow my mind with how much talent this girl has her ethereal voice in i know it s you is unsettling as it evokes haunting pictures of the moonlight just her moans alone raise the goosebumps off my neck somehow i get the same dreams that i do from listening to the requiem for a dream soundtrack it s subtle and exquisite in every good way possible the trippy sounds of broken glass messed up with what seems like part two of born too slow comes in the fashion of weapons of mass distortion the chaos continues as the riff-conscious track disperses shattering breaks it seems that the lack of showcasing with limp got wes to release all the trigger-happy madness that has been bottling up since his departure the final moments belong to lisa and sha-key the intensity of wide open and high and low propels the album drifting into space started as producers then growing as a live techno act jordan and kirkland has now fully amalgamated with rappers rock stars and a supermodel to create a lavish hybrid of sound to appeal to both fans of trendy electronica and hardcore faithful staying true to their strengths the new album will please many fans going from extremes packs enough nocturnal treasures and psychedelic storms that jordan and kirkland have been known for with techno leading the way american audiences welcomed vegas as the quintessential party record that redefined what dance music was and can be mainstream america always the late boomer to embrace new sounds will once again term electronica as cool tracklisting 01 starting over featuring rahzel 02 born too slow featuring wes borland/john garcia 03 true grit 04 the american way featuring rahzel 05 i know it s you featuring milla jovovich 06 realizer featuring lisa/jon brion 07 broken glass featuring wes borland 08 weapons of mass distortion featuring wes borland 09 bound too long featuring ska-key 10 acetone featuring rahzel 11 high and low featuring lisa 12 wide open featuring sha-key http://www v2records com http://www thecrystalmethod com

moscow-based artist s music has been described as russian juke and his album for nicolas jaars label does bear a distinct regional character is named after a town north of moscow and its artwork shows bruegels hunters in the snow superimposed with soviet tower blocks s music meanwhile is constructed from samples of russian pop r b and easy listening all underpinned by frantic footwork beats and yet this explorer of the slavic soul sounds familiar like jaar and the other artists he supports (acid pauli valentin stip) s music is possessed of a delicate melancholy predicated on the juxtaposition of real instruments dusty samples and glitchy electronica fans emphasise his eastern european otherness but can easily be explained in voguish western reference points short and hallucinatory his tracks are as ephemeral as early mount kimbie fragmentary like zomby bathed like actress in a dubbed-out soft-focus corrosion like those artists s work is elusive but has flashes of beauty and creative wit from the atmospheric witch-house smear of to the pretty dysfunction of crackles with ideas but they are rarely developed into anything meaty the lo-fi rhythmic mania of (a tangential dance floor track) or the lovely acoustic guitar-led feel like tentative sketches which twists itself inside out from a warm whirring loop into a slow soul jam is the most structurally satisfying track here in such moments certainly sounds like a global player
there are giants looming over the first full-length from joe mcbrides alias a diehard of bass music ambient and downtempo the manchester producer has often coasted in the shadows of popular electronic artists recent records acceptance and transient wore influences burial and boards of canada like sports jerseys but mcbride still occasionally diverged into jazzy or experimental places however lifts more of the same undeniably familiar sounds and ideas with next to zero inventiveness it makes for a lazy pastiche as if references to great music are all an album needs to resonate with listeners spotting the soundalikes is so easy it could be a drinking game by the time drops its burial-lite shuffle anyone with a bottle of hard stuff might be under the table theres the wavering juno tones in that are identical to eohtrix point nevers early ambient work (ditto eight-minute closer ) theres singer robert manos who seems to be impersonating junior boys jeremy greenspan amidst the usual post-dubstep argot on two of the most egregious examples sounds like holy other without the rhythmic grace or emotional subtlety and is a soulless boards of canada imitation that would be inexcusable if it wasnt the records closest thing to an upbeat track the rudimental five-chord progression that is could also be a welcome change of pace but i was too busy thinking of all the other songs it reminded me of to appreciate it and therein lies mcbrides downfall: no matter how well-produced or nicely arranged can be it only asks to be compared to a number of very specific easily recognizable artists its the distraction holding the music back from success on its own terms trading personality for generic mediocrity what makes this more perplexing is akkord the techno project mcbride has with indigo even if the duos self-titled album wasnt masterfully crafted its no less a marvel of precision dance music and flinty soundscapes something like on the other hand is low-rent drama lifted from classic dbridge with a bland needless vocal calling out this love this love is getting heavy taking surface issues out of the equation the fact remains that offers scant movement or scope most of mcbrides tracks slowly ease into a dour motif and spin the wheels until well its hard to say the title track finds its endpoint after twice repeating the rise and fall of glitched beats basinski-esque string loops and nighttime field recordings just before that makes a slow one-time pass through heavy sub-bass pitched-down vocals and the piano from john carpenters halloween theme it fades away having revealed nothing of itself or its creator
on the first track on s new album a graceful melody drapes itself over a steady house kick and snare while an array of synths billow in the distance at once ethereal and precise its archetypal stuff from the veteran la producer as is much of an album that shows tejada using his well-honed studio acumen to transcendent effect is typical tejada in a more prosaic way as well: its titles tejadas always had a thing for sci-fi-influenced track names dating back at least to prism war and solar eyes both from 1997s little green lights and four ch faders he goes to town on this album with titles like (a photoreceptor that helps guide circadian rhythms) (an early supercontinent) and r u r (the 192 karel apek play that introduced the word robot to the english language) much of is imbued with a kind of resigned romanticism one thats greatly enhanced by tejadas sonic template the songs have a haunted distant feel and even the albums poppier moments are touched with melancholy tracks like and mix pure-pleasure hooks with a tinge of heartache evoking memories of late-8 s depeche mode as he tends to do tejada occasionally trades the four-to-the-floor kick for something more syncopated this time electro is his alternate groove of choice with its electrofunk rhythm anchoring a contemplative melody is a gentle treat; which goes in a more doomy direction has sharper claws but even that track swirls in the poignant bliss that buoys a beautiful collection of tunes as striking as they are subtle
alex o smith better known as - is a cult figure in house music for a few reasons theres the sound of his records: a bit sci-fi a bit soulful delivered with simplicity theres his salty charisma something you get in interviews as well as track titles ( u heard what da man said muthafukka ) and thats offset by an evident soft side (techno tear-jerkers dont come much better than the further you look the less you see ) but perhaps most important is his extraordinary consistency the detroit producer has released a few 12-inches every year since 2003 some of them have been spectacular all of them are at least solid his latest is and while its unlikely to have the staying power of say 2012s triangulum australe (say it in space) it still exudes the effortless style that makes him great the title alkoholik is like many of -ss track names a red herring its lush and melodic deep house cut from the same cloth as kraftwerks computer love and has an even lighter touch tinny claps and hi-hats frame a bubbling flow of keys eventually joined by a short-lived kick drum the record finishes with muthafukka a grimy acid house number smith could have made in his sleep not that i hold it against him smiths unfussy approach is part of his appeal if it makes for an unforgettable track every now and then im willing to give him a pass

give a track to and chances are hell hand back something you dont recognize alabama producer fits somewhere in the crop of new grime producers but his work comes from a different place hes the kind of guy who can turn a young thug track into a 13-minute ambient techno journey or chop up a pop track so thinly you have to sift for traces of the original even more exciting was his functions of now mix which took a series that focused on cutting-edge club sounds and steered it towards grouper steve roach and la monte young formerly producing as william skeng its the project where the young americans original productions have really come alive on his debut for dublins he lives up to the talk thats been following him around in grime circles over the past six months theme of is escapism more specifically an escape from the mind-numbing world of computer screens and the internet res something vaguely distant and exotic about the title track floating along like a daydream without ever quite touching the ground its an ornate take on grime with all the heavy support beams removed avoids structuring his tracks around big drops or climaxes and instead lets them loop meditatively is laid-back trap built around a single piano sample while brings church bells into the frame rather than focusing on their more epic qualities he zeroes in on the resonance and decay fine-tuning the details to the point where minuscule variations become seismic shifts re are bigger moments on the ep centres on a big dusty percussion loop all fogged up like a clams casino tune and is the one moment that directly engages with grime tropes built on big brass notes and barbed-wire basslines that bring out shades of slackk but even this one is gutted by a near-silent breakdown followed by a fake fade-out thatll make you check the pause button its just one example of doing a lot with very little
is a gorgeous melancholic affair which sees metro areas teaming up with junior boys vocalist jeremy greenspan for a batch of stirring techno-soul choice of greenspan is pretty much a no-brainer not only because of his synth-pop background but also because his breathy angelic lilt is a terrific complement to geists ornate and emotive electronics album marks geists first foray into traditional song production but dont call it pop effervescence and catharsis are largely absent here instead theres a strong motown happy/sad vibe in some sense the perfect object of expression for the geist-greenspan team for example brims with the sort of dolce vita glitz you might expect from the title but its tinged with distantiatio; its palace life not through the eyes of the sated king but an interloper alienated yet momentarily enthralled lead single showcases geists unparalleled production skills: crystalline hi-def synth bursts are borne up by a super-warm low end and that pulsing electro-shimmy thats his rhythmic trademark its a reminder that throughout his career geist has been able to mine the regions between techno and disco in consistently innovative and rewarding ways returning each time anew to experiment with human hearts in robot bodies might seem to have two strikes against it: res a clich d vocal sample repeatedly announcing the citys name and as some have noted the song flows directly into one of geists own earlier tracks the b-side 24k but if you consider just how much is suffused with melancholic reflection (with lyrics like can you recall that night / we drove through the stars and i remember that night feelings i no longer know ) then both the vocal sample and geists self-interpolation come into clearer focus; the past is resurrected on multiple levels a beautiful private memory a bygone golden age of music and even ones own past artistic accomplishments its a brilliant multi-faceted elegy of lost happiness one that gets to revel in the ghosts of joy its conjured even as they eventually recede again into the darkness not out of nostalgia but for the sake of transformation just as greenspan sings elsewhere the present circumstances paint the past as something new instrumental tracks here are untouchable: youre not likely to hear synthesizers with such compelling gloss and shimmer elsewhere anytime soon and are sexy nocturnal slow-burners endowed with solid doses of luscious 80s electro-funk and the most metro area-like on the album is an atmospheric stomp heavy on john carpenter/goblin portent vocal tracks however are more hit-or-miss of and is a particular clunker: greenspan sounds uninspired with lines like first ill get the car then ill fix up the yard underneath the mid-tempo drums feel just as weighed down by the cares of a family man everything seems like its pushing to glow darkly with noirish intensity but the aimed-for transcendence of smoke and flame never rises up from in-between the sluggish beats and uncertain vocals re are a few other wincers scattered here and there like the awkward cadences of of but thats part of the conscious risk for geist this time: in his recent ra interview he mentions wanting specifically to aim for emotional directness in the way an old jazz standard is direct if youre not irving berlin however then with such unabashed lyrical simplicity youve got to rely heavily on melodic wallop to deliver the goods and thats a gamble that pays off about half the time here is a more effective case: its a strutting funk ballad with a classic 80s synth-bell melody that stages romantic drama against a backdrop of sci-fi urban malaise tracks passionate vulnerable outro is one of the albums highlights encapsulating the world of love longing and ennui in the neon wilderness that pervades
after reviewing the delights of the cd mixed version of sound in motion by i can safely say that the unmixed vinyl release is just as good essentially they are the same tunes but hooj have chosen the best of the pack so to speak for this release 3 slabs of vinyl with 4 tracks on each slab disc one pj davy freezing point (dave robertson frozen remix) a purely devastating baseline is the key to this track as well as the delights of the simple drum pattern used the baseline changes shape midway in turning the track into an electro fuelled driving production bermuda triangle tay do 22 one of the highlight tracks of the album this is bermuda triangle at their best a great drum pattern is intertwined with a deep baseline that gather pace throughout a beautiful vocal sample is used to give this track a great uplifting edge dave robertson slang for funky as the name suggest this production has a great funk to it again pretty much down to the deep silky baseline used as with the pj davy remix the drums are very solid the production introduces a twisited acid hook deep in to give it another level a great track animated come on taken from the quivver ep come on is a twisted production that works amazingly well in the mix as its own on the other hand it is just as good using great drum patterns a very dirty baseline and some eerie effects to keep the fire fuelling great stuff disc two simon levin gone used early in the mix by james this production is a great smooth journey into smooth atmospheric sounds and a great little melody the broken beats enter the track a little in however it maintains a smooth fa ade for its entirety ebon sleepless 2 (original tribal mix) this production was a great addition to the mix and comes from a man by the name of justin lake-whedon it has a deep as hell baseline and a cheeky little vocal sample that gives this production a great feel some nice expanding base sounds deep into the track also give it another edge a producer to look out for bushwacka break your face this man needs no introduction really another solid piece of work by bushwacka it s a pacey production that was pitched down by james but uses some nice sound effects throughout combined with a nice deep baseline and some good drum work ant process cyan min quite simply one of the tracks from the album this is a fiery track that words almost cannot describe clearly pitched down by james in the mix it s a combination of deep drubbing baselines hypnotic drums and a very unique and head warping fusion of effects and sounds brilliant peak time madness disc three lanoiraude j j scenario a smooth and quirky production this one which makes use of a croaking baseline and nice effects the track breaks down in smooth fashion midway with some nice atmospheric strings which is a great highlight of the production earth dueley spacial gathering a great track this one it takes a few moments to build with nice drum work and great sound effects but once that bouncy baseline gets going the track is simply brilliant the silence acid attack my personal highlight of the compilation this track builds and builds for its entirety the drums build from start to finish while the acid rumbles ride the production the signature acid sweep in this track is simple yet genius especially when it frequently makes an appearance deep into the track a period where all elements are working overtime natural rhythm your world a deep and smooth production this the highlight is the stuttering drum pattern as well as the subtle and not too overpowering vocals the track maintains a good flow throughout and makes good use of sound effects if you liked the cd release and own decks then there really is no excuse not to have this vinyl release

antonio pecori is one of a handful of artists behind a new label called oltrarno records both last years debut ( worlds a mini-compilation featuring the core label crew) and feel intimate from their beautifully packaged presses of 250 to the deep house sounds whose faint eccentricities seem to be sketched by pencil this solo debut from pecoris project has a subtleness thats even more striking lays out four trippy vigorous house tracks teeming with exotic textures ep gives off a velvety looseness but nearly all of the tracks are 130 bpm or above is the exception: it whorls around softly acquiring paper-thin layers of dusty alien sounds also has a lattice of details but this time theyre glamorous and the kicks are slamming pecori keeps that energy up throughout the b-side is s most hypnotic selection pared down to a slick minimal track with deep blue loops and parades iridescent and electrifying synth melodies around submerged drums sometimes the tracks playfulness goes on for too long but they leave plenty of attractive colors in their wake
the last track on is a skit a phone call between two music producers who are complaining about the industry and specifically idiotic labels that ask for retro-futurist commercial-underground tracks in a way that conversation explains this album individually alex cortex and lopazz have always kicked against an electronic music scene which demands that in order to maximise their marketability artists must be genre-consistent and still alive to new trends needless to say now that the berlin duo are working together as bad cop bad cop they have no intention of knuckling under to orthodox definitions of house or techno it is a righteous stance but one that perhaps by its very nature doesnt produce great albums if youre going to follow your creative impulse wherever it takes you the eclectic tracks that result still need to hang together as a body of work sounds like a collection of highly personal outtakes demos and experiments often sketched out in such a rudimentary way that they look very feint next to lopazzs best work ( i need ya his masterful 2 fast 4 you ) wilful noise is not the problem if only it was the fourth track is a so-so slab of distorted lo-fi techno but prior to that the vibe is playful sophistication the opener is perky poppy even all pots n pans percussion ricocheting bloops and wiggly little earworms it recalls the eccentric micro-house that snax or n ze were making in 2007 is 3 am lovers funk akin to no regular plays acid fried easy listening there are moments of great potential (the superpitcher-esque indie-dance of ) and moments of genuine intrigue (the twisted swampy melodica and sax-spattered funk of ) but they are rarely developed beyond a basic repetitive idea the best track a beautiful excursion into sombre bass music is dispensed in under three minutes is this an insider joke it certainly sounds a lot like zomby another producer who isnt afraid to release bitty fragments of material either way its much better than an aimless meander of tinny hissing drum machines moog-ish squiggles and bobbling hyper-funk which ultimately sounds like a warped cassette recording of some old krautrock soundcheck was it fun to make possibly does that translate no
s subversive marketing strategies grab the headlines but the reason their music has retained respect is the music itself this is yet another choice selection of remixers for their recent album and the result is everything youd hope for lone sounds like lone four sounds like classic four and pearson cuts thom yorkes vocals in with his 808 sample pack whats really interesting though is the way that they each have a little surprise for you lones got a chaotic dancehall rhythm to support his sun-bleached melodies rather than the usual house beat four is back to the clattery percussion from everything ecstatic underlies lilting vocals in the same way as his remix of atoms for peace before going all woolly and bass-heavy in the second part david kennedy is always full of surprises anyway and his remix is frantic but with lightness and space vinyl sold out sharpish but after it did they put a free stream on their website anyway good thing the music is worth it

s broad palette seems a perfect match for n s imprint on baytala is joined by fellow san franciscan built on a framework of feline synth growls and itchy percussion the pair lay down a sparse brooding house groove that starts off dark and leaves the lights switched off baytala opens the drapes on a chirpy slab of disco tinged house with a moreish bassline and an upfront kick drum reminiscent of fred falke n remix of has a meandering bassline jagged hunks of guitar and a fair chunk of disco baytalas ocal neighbours pillow talk provide the most intriguing offering setting free to wander all over the shop its a delicious trippy jumble of laser guided kraftwerkian beats bass and the late 90s french house tropes that characterized the original
for two techno giants who are each worth their weight in funktion-one subs lucy and ben klock are especially restrained on their first collaborative release the four-track favors winding tension and dark open spaces over outright grooves or rhythmic assaults but thats not to say those things never appear the dubby is built on a sci-fi 4/4 pattern with a tenacious thud towards the end of the title track a glimpse of mid- and high-range percussion serves as its modest climax the rest of however is pure atmosphere and subdued movements which for some could be a disappointment coming from two producers known for full-bodied techno nonetheless have no trouble proving themselves in other ways crafts its deep moody churn in a tightly sealed pressure cooker and will undoubtedly open its share of dj sets despite being a short beatless synthscape the airy arpeggio in is an intoxicating rhythm ripe for a drum-centric edit but theres little contest as to the eps strongest moment: capitalizes on the duos idiosyncrasies for six and a half minutes of subterranean dance music lifted straight from klocks playbook the bin-busting hard stuff carries the track through a cobwebbed maze of lucys sound design theres a strong sense that only skims the surface of what its producers can do together like an intriguing precursor to the highly anticipated main event
of all the acts who release music on sued none are more puzzling than a collaboration by philip gelberg and label co-founder svn the duo specialize in drum sketches that are raw un-quantized and weirdly pleasing their first ep which came out last april on sued presented two cuts of hazy tribal rhythms with small splashes of synth around the same time they released a record on acido with under the name s p posse the sound was similar yet distinctly different: set against a wispy ambience its rhythms were catchy and oddly angular but this time perfectly on the grid with six more tracks in the same vein the duos latest record on sued offers a fuller glimpse into their sound all of these tracks have the same ingredients: scratchy live drums (presumably sampled) warm chords and odd synth frequencies that drift by like eye floaters stark and grainy as they are the arrangements are wonderfully rich their tactile percussion (woodblocks cabasas full drum kits) jelling beautifully with the surrounding electronic debris despite the narrow palette there is an impressive range of tempos and styles some tracks feel hip-hop-inspired (the languorous the endtroducing -style b3) the first two b-side tracks have more african rhythms (b1 even has what sounds like an electric thumb piano the fuzzy melody-maker at the center of konono no 1s music) the a2 is a string of fluttering drum fills almost like something youd play on buckets and the a3 is a warped stumbling groove that seems totally removed from any existing musical tradition like sued in general these tracks are as enigmatic as they are addictive
s sophomore effort on shlomi ber s imprint sees him fly solo without the safety net of any remixes he s done this before though on his well-received underground ullshit 12-inch on ovum but unfortunately this double -side doesn t quite match the quality of that release hits you quickly with an excellent rolling bassline custom made for stupid-face pulling and fist pumping but the (all too familiar) staccato twang melody that follows is a disappointment looping and looping and looping and looping and loo *smack* (sorry my ctrl + v got stuck) without much variation on the flip a is a druggy houser centred around a club-themed monologue similar to peace division s lacklight sleaze or tejada s sweat on the walls pitched at around 120bpm it s slow and heavy with enough clipped horns and twinkles to keep it moderately interesting past the five-minute mark overall this ep feels like a couple of throwaway tracks packaged to ride the wave of previous successes while both sides are usable they aren t mind-blowing either ut never fear is preparing a remix package of with deetron and mark room which look guaranteed to make up for it

from throwing parties in tube stations to releasing records from lfo luke vibert and plaid london duo posthuman have done their bit to preserve the spirit of acid in the uk more recently theyve turned their attention to their events and the label offshoot of the same name the nascent imprint calls on another acid old-timer for its fourth release as unleashes three beefy club weapons a remix from altern8s mark completes the package though the labels first three eps have been strongly floor-focussed hill steps things up a notch on 004 brings together elements of jackin chicago house and acid techno with sharp 303s and fierce hi-hats galloping over a rude groove he strips away the swing on sending loopy acid curls and robotic refrains over straight-talking kicks its a dj tool thatll perk up any lagging dance floors is too busy to be considered as such recalling the heyday of rave with its dynamic palette of screaming 303s mashed-up vocals and sense of foreboding on the remix leaves an inch of space between the drums and percussion lending his take a roomy feel once the vintage stabs pierce the surface youve got a record big enough to fill fields as well as floors
perhaps even to untrained ears the differences between the output of and his alias are obvious dystopian austerity on one hand dance floor celebration on the other its always a joy to hear the minimal techno master revel in each projects idiosyncrasies but joining the two on one vinyl is a treat that presents for the first time as it happens this two track 12 inch actually shows just how much the two aliases speak to each other there are distinct rhythmic parallels shared by and that carry s inimitable mark both productions maintain an unrelenting rigidness and with every couple thuds of their steady kicks an off pattern bounce punctuates the loop on this means employs hard squelching fx s transposes the accent to a prismatic synth thats in constant flux around simple claps and ticking hi hats everything is tightly wound for the records duration too with nimble percussion shifting incidentals and quasi melodic textures adding to the claustrophobia a disembodied voice lurks beneath s heavy churn and the effect feels like a bastardized sample as it coldly repeats you understand me now
an air of mystery surrounds oddball italian electronic duo their live sets take in film fashion and (logically) music and the pair regularly perform in costume a la daft punk or kraftwerk that was enough for ellen allien and her label however who present their self-titled debut album here opening with downbeat duet the florentine outfit show a yearning desire reminiscent of early fink the xx and casiotone for the painfully alone theres little of the acoustic psychedelic or suicidal tendencies inherent within those respective acts but the send and return vocals of producers giorgia angiuli and piero fragola marry darkness with desperation just as well shades of rthern exposure -era progressive breakbeat are rife throughout but its also coupled with a dubstep-not-dubstep influence which makes the album come off like a modern update of trip-hop or downbeat for instance has staccato hammers that stick like glue to thudding kicks as the pair again share time on the microphone this time through an opiate haze that belies the commanding drums and head-ringing brain-melting hook is perhaps as close to perfection as is reached here angiulis vocals swoop loop and stretch while guitar strings gently pluck above sub-mariner bleeps similarly impressive outings are found in and the heart-stopping plain with both vocalists equally effective at hypnotism the former offers male-dominated epicness while the latter is the best club track here contrasting siren-like femininity with pitch-black atmosphere no doubt earning a place in sinister sets from forward-thinking djs the closest to mainstream music-video dance as this album gets fails to truly disappoint ibizan strings loop stab and then cut into vocoder breakdowns before a familiar eurodance beat kicks back in predictable but nonetheless somehow enjoyable that said on the whole is rarely strictly club music and its a world away from what most would call real downbeat it instead bridges the gap between couch and club with seemingly effortless ease its easy to see why allien fell in love

is the alias of jesse rose whose work has appeared on such labels as dubsided and classic as well as his own front room recordings with his newest track its so he adds his name to the simple roster in addition to roses original the latest release on will sauls label includes a remix by the boss himself who with loads of releases on simple as well as air recordings and 10 kilo has become somewhat of a household name the original mix sports a clean metallic sound complimented by an almost robotic endlessly looped and chopped female vocal ( its its its so simple ) that rides the beat from beginning to end crisp and punchy the track has plenty of bleeps and computerized noises but still holds on to some organic essence thanks to its easy-going natural groove something like a melody floats above never quite touching down and everything seems to be moving along just fine until the second bassline shows up continuously bending in pitch it adds a certain funk at first; quickly however it becomes all but unbearable and as it continues until nearly the end of the track stopping the record halfway through is the likely listener response for the remix meanwhile saul maintains the tracks clean sound but completely reformulates every other aspect bringing in a brand-new bassline and showing a little more musical sensibility saul shapes a groove with a bit more pull he also creates an entirely new melody on which he places more emphasis and to which he applies s pitch bending idea - making sure though to keep it within the realms of what a person can take and perhaps actually enjoy the melody eases in slowly gradually overpowering and forcing out all other elements of the track until its the only sound there just as it reaches the top though it falls back underneath only to begin its ascent and reach the peak once more before falling off for good after that its just a few more rounds of the beat and the bassline and then the whole thing is done and saul both keep the label name in mind with this one keeping things very simple indeed in fact both versions seem more like dj tools than full-on tracks: both just sort of plod along for a while and then end abruptly while sauls mix is easy enough on the ears to be useful in this respect though s original is at best too boring and at worst too annoying to have any real benefits

now back in the uk after a berlin sojourn irish dance-music-writer-turned-producer adds to an already impressive cv which has seen cadenza get physical and cocoon make use of his ample musical talents emotional tech house of has a doleful analogue bassline snaking through it a hint of a kerri chandler cowbell and swathes of rich pads pummelling you like a thai massage its complex insofar as there are lots of ideas running through it but not in an overly fussy way its so textured you can reach out and touch it in contrast inhabits darker 3 m places; herlihy serves up the warmth of a distorted rhodes piano to counterbalance paranoid bass growls and minimalist brush strokes just to show off goes somewhere totally different to its siblings in this case thats some future disco house valhalla where angelic hosts proclaim above twinkling g-funk stylings and heavily-reverbed bass wobbles
this is the first release on the label offshoot of australian radio show-turned-podcast which has been running for nearly a decade and has featured sets by artists like tornado wallace and beppe loda as nimh founder and host michael kucyk told ra last month the two tracks on this first 12-inch were orginally intended for a commission his partner gave las aka diego herrera to score a show at sydney fashion week the pieces are duly moody stylish and long steadies itself with several minutes of slow tick-tock percussion and the eerie sounds of what might be a distorted flute before finally ceding to a rubbery beat and dramatic 80s synth wheezes on the flip periodically zaps snappy beats keys and chimes through a fog of pads and strung-out bass its not quite the big-ticket event that krafts exquisite eps for running back and young adults were but has an odd intrigue all its own
you get the impression that the sued cofounder sw had a creative breakthrough sometime in the last few years for a while he was the most elusive member of a deeply elusive crew working in solitude outside stuttgart while svn sueds other founder held jam sessions in a studio inside berlins neues deutschland building that largely defined the labels sound that dynamic began to shift in 2015 when sw released reminder part three a breakbeat-inspired 12-inch more abstract and cinematic than anything hed done before this sound came further into focus on his incredibly rich lp from last year easily sueds best record yet it develops further on his latest 12-inch sueds untitled 16th release sued16 finds sw more unleashed than ever from existing sounds and styles though the result is so natural that you might not notice how unusual it is the record presents two versions of the same untitled track both are 133 bpm with gusts of snares and hi-hats pinned down by deep bass tones at the beginning of each measure the coasts along for over 14 minutes changing slowly and almost imperceptibly its aquatic pads forming a cool mist for the drums to float in the is half as long with slightly dryer sounds (like that amazing percolator at the very beginning) but generally follows the same script summoning a lush and vivid atmosphere with a seemingly improvised sequence of drum patterns t a stretch you might hear distant echoes of jazz techno or even drum bass but really these tracks sound like nothing except sw
the snails pace of releases from new yorks two best disco groups makes a whole lot more sense now metro reas darshan jesrani and escorts dan alis team up here for a journey into the skies on irlines om records mainstay lisa shaw turns in vocals scrubbed free of much personality but thats exactly what this old-school disco track needs the strings bass liquid synth and their interplay with the drums are the stars of this show ut fans of metro reas penchant for moderation need not worry: the track rarely reaches to a climax thatll have you screaming for more instead is intelligent hedonism: tasteful enough for your next 70s-themed party (the original) cool enough to rock a basement disco show (the flipsides dub)
df s bread and butter might be party-ready dance-rock but these days its their club 12-inch desserts that are likely to become the menu standouts so if for example you found juan macleans new full-length a bit undercooked rest assured you can safely turn your appetite towards s of the a stunning sizzling hybrid of first wave house-techno warp-era idm plonk and underground disco handily pulls off a grand frankenstein stitch resulting in a genre-bending mutant that sounds less like a single conceit and more like a mini dj set of the opens with a ron trent-reminiscent analog pulse nestled in the middle nicely accented by stereoed tambourines a balance that allows human disco and inhuman techno to fold snugly into one another n halfway through pad swoops appear over an 808 pattern and everything falls into a lock-groove that sounds as if a loose-limbed electro jam has been caught in a 4-bar time loop headed for infinity is immediately arresting in an understated thoughtful way capturing your attention not with a bludgeoning hook or gripping vocal sample but by pulling off the delicate act of sounding classic and fresh at the same time needless to say every dj needs tunes in the bag that are guaranteed party propane regardless of time and place and its hard to imagine a situation where you drop and it doesnt add fuel to the fire new yorks drug-disco kingpins rub-n-tug hand in an unpredictable beast of a remix which is more or less precisely what you want them to do ir version keeps the snakewinding style-hopping spirit of the original sounding a bit like one of their sets in nuce all gritty throb and late-night left-turns it opens with a lock-loop of one of the originals 90s-style house breakdowns and youd have every right to expect a mighty build into some serious stratosphere-scraping but the groove suddenly dissipates and then reforms finally gathering steam but then before theres really a chance to peak the propulsion cools off again and things settle into some trippy vaguely reichian synth noodling leave it to these guys to casually toss off a burning disco-house groove and then prefer to leave it in the dust when the mood strikes bit frustrating yes but you dont roll with rub-n-tug because you expect them to hold your hand and follow the rules same is true of df
f you love walls tracks like burnt sienna may come as a shock hazy sun-dappled electronica and raw analogue grooves are in short supply here and little wonder album was commissioned by the bbc who gave the london duo access to the archive of daphne oram founder in 1958 of the bbcs radiophonic workshop this journey into miles of deteriorating quarter-inch tape led to ten scowling (rather than shoegazing) tracks drawn from 1960s synth sounds feels a little sketchy and conceptual three tracks are under two minutes long and even in its most brutal phases it never quite achieves the monolithic power of artists like demdike stare shifted or samuel kerridge nonetheless if the aim was to show how orams sinister dystopian sound prefigured the current generation of dread-mongers walls make a decent fist of it re is plenty to chew on in or particularly for radiophonic workshop geeks walls are on far surer ground when deploying elegant ambient tropes or motoring along wide-eyed and spaced-out in krautrocks wake s t s n is the most walls-ian track of the set while an off-dance floor experiment in befogged funereal dub techno give the album a meaty core shrill outsized meanwhile suggests this could have been a very different album had walls taken it in a more lighthearted direction think of as a quality curio
though hotflush claim is a fresh face in uk techno considering the production sheen that coats this debut and the scenes penchant for nom de plumes it would be naive to assume that he or she hasnt released under another name in fact the ep straddles the imprints varied discography so aptly that it might be a hotflush mainstay dabbling in new sounds though sticks mostly to the labels current techno formula all thumping kicks and room-filling synths closer looks back a few years with a loping two-step beat and chest-rattling subs that could come from a triangulation offcut the track showcases s knack for dread-laced atmospheres similarly deployed on beatless opener in a miasma of pitch-shifted vocals and descending chords but for all its tension this is an oddly sketch-like way to open a debut release its begging for a kick and another four minutes to unfurl though excels at texture he/she lacks some pizazz when working a floor the stronger of the 4/4 pair wiggles a muted 303 through equally dampened piano chords but is stabs-and-kicks fodder that feels like its been built from a template whoever is they should embrace the opportunity to be more adventurous that comes with being an anonymous artist
best known for his techno releases with tenax and cocoon ilario alicante lives up to his prodigious tab by veering off into some idiosyncratic downtempo on on the air hangs heavy with melancholia on the lead cut its ushered in by what sounds like the break from led zeppelins kashmir injected with xanax swiftly joined by a mewing analogue synth line that patters across it and the most doleful of female vocals its techno simmered on a low heat for several hours its a testimony to records creativity and quality that matthew gets his hands on the remix electronica deity gently pushes it back to the dance floor although its hardly a crazed interpretation with working in muted indonesian gamelan-style organic percussion to the piece is even lovelier and bleaker with a funereal piano motif crisp but subtle techno rhythm and a robotic emotionless voice incanting over it its flipped on its head by swedens mrsk who drops it into a bubbling vat of growling dub techno spilling over into scary synth lines and chattering cut-up vocals alicante in techno guise would approve as - he would already have headed back home for a smoke
the debut of ilya ziblat shay and jordan czamanski is best approached with an open mind going deep on free jazz twists and harshly drawn synth doodles the duos music inhabits a spacious exposed sound whose coldness stings like frostbite taking cues from the likes of sun ras the magic city and bill dixons son of sisyphus is a record of raw beauty tangled up in atonal knots and solo screes on you get a sense of the world are building sharp cello strokes slice into digital bird calls and a thin sustained organ note its the sound of an exotic but nightmarish place as it rings with scrap metal noise slowly aligns its roaming solos and fizzing synth chords by the tracks hallucinatory slow-burning coda shay and czamanski forge an uneasy union between those sounds from this pitch-black source material i:cube fashions an upbeat remix starting out as glistening deep house with a purring bassline the remixs first two minutes sound out of step with shay and czamanskis vision but i:cube follows s lead his remix begins with an appetising spread of sounds then swerves into the weirdness that makes the rest of such an adventure
when canadian producer jake fairley released his second album as back in 2007 james holdens trance-indebted border community seemed the perfect home for his wide-eyed take on expansive electronica coloured in memory was indeed a colorful venture into psychedelic electronica singles such as i need medicine and flight the albatross both suggested escapism and voyage on his most recent long-player for torontos my favorite robot the mood is starker more austere especially compared to the labels current ferings from the mansisters tiger stripes or jonny cruz on new tracks like and fairleys trance-ish take on leftfield dance music is still pretty much in synch with what former label-mates margot or wesley matsell have released on border community that said it seems the goal here is also to produce pop songs with a classical edge la early 90s depeche mode take a song which from its pristine synthetic arrangements to its very title cant help but channel the synth pop greats it doesnt always work this well though: other tracks such as fast and both have a sluggish pulse that never really takes f with it seems fairley decided to take a trip down memory lane right up to his formative years during which violator and songs faith and devotion seem to have became key reference points on album album highlight a contemplative almost gothic tone makes for a beguiling listen that does justice to fairleys heroes; on he even marries these impulses with his former more trippy holden-esque inclinations his inclusion in the my favorite robot family is a welcome addition to a label that is becoming more and more multi-faceted and adventurous
donato dozzy doing disco thats actually exactly what it is in a way on the italian producer teams up with fellow countryman claudio fabrianesi for an achingly slow 12-inch of smoky grooves the title track has the moody synths that often typify dozzy productions but the programming seems to be all fabrianesi a straight-and-narrow downtempo rhythm that holds things together around its firm backing too tasteful possibly its easy to see soundtracking the buddha bar as it is the beginning of a nine-hour epic set that gracefully moves from sub-100 bpm tempos to something harder and faster you can tell in the duo and mules decision to release the atmosphere of the original though where they all stand on the issue and 12-inch capper further avoids any claims of tastefulness by offering more pop ambient -styled synth washes the vibe here is more unsettled a bit more unsure of itself but the beat is forceful absolutely clear in its intent while gets lost in head-nodding and marijuana smoke is invigorated by the murk pushing forward through the haze play both in a club at your own risk; play both at home often
the name said it all when ndon djs terry francis nathan coles and eddie richards started their night in 1994 they wanted to inject a dose of gyrating low end into 4/4 it was all about the basslines as richards said in his recent ra exchange 20 years on those basslines are still there but they now sound straitjacketed by the conventions of tech house the irony of tech house is that though it began as deliberate attempt to mix genres it became as inward looking as any of the purists it railed against it seemed like a good idea at the time: spinning house tough enough for the techno boys and techno groovy enough for their girlfriends to get down to yet when tech house became a sound in itself the results often felt like a half arsed compromise you cant hold the lads responsible for the tepid stuff churned up in their wake indeed their recordings label has put out some excellent tech house records like 2000s discfunktional from coles and francis as the delinquents but their 20th anniversary mix featuring 20 unreleased tracks from affiliates like djulz and is an example of the raw sonics and pedestrian rhythms that often make tech house something of a curates egg slamming straight in with no sense of build up or buggering about and temp oneils has the warped vocals and slivers of melody that are a defining feature of this mix on some tracks like s theres simply nothing to sink your teeth into but in others such as s and the darren remix of s you get a sweet taste of soulful vocals or a sharp acid tang but in general the narrow range of sounds and tempos makes for a pretty monotonous diet the mixing is impeccably tight in the way it locks into the groove but only the the eagle eared will pick up the barely perceptible shifts in tone on tracks like s theres no sense of climax with and s the mix finishes as suddenly as it starts maybe some find that lack of release tantric but for the rest of us is bound to be a little unsatisfying
given the crushing intensity of his music with chris spero as dense pika you might think would struggle to define himself working solo but then he was already making fine records before the much-lauded techno duo existed the finds the cofounder continuing his rich vein of form with three tracks that kick hard without being quite as brutish as his work with spero on jones squeezes together heavy kicks thick toms and stuttering hi-hats offsetting these elements with a throbbing keyboard phrase that sounds like an argentinean tango bandoneon twisted out of shape the ghostly gospel sample subtle chapel organs and bluesy piano on soften the mood but its the one-two combo of an insanely bouncy bassline and punchy claps that keep things locked to the dance floor if you took a blindfold test on the ep its that drops the strongest hints at its provenance with its walloping rhythm and demonic samples its the most dense pika-like of these sweaty grinding techno tracks
single number 3 for follows directly from their second release give me a break with bill vega new decades trademark brand of techy atmospheric breaks sounds like it belongs on a soundtrack to an old sci-fi action thriller and is the first release on to be remixed by outside producers side a crunchy rolling breaks open up and they have a noticeably old skool rave feel to them arpeggio string melodies and a warped bassline kick in giving the tune a futuristic sci-fi feel only to be helped out later by a lone female vocal sample which itself feels like it s been sampled from a sci-fi flick thick in texture all the way throughout it s a bombardment of heavy bass hard breaks (quite similar to prophecy on their first 12 ) and atmospheric synth lines with a couple of clever breakdowns and build-ups in between it s a good track to keep momentum flowing in a set side b (big square sound vs rna remix) bss and rna provide the first external remix for and they take and transform it into a storming breaks monster kicking things off with a heavy breakbeat they slowly incorporate techy synths a big bassline an acid 303 line and include a male vocal sample to accompany the female vocals after the first buildup bss and rna turn the bass up to the point where the speakers will rumble and play with the filters to give it a nice wavy effect awesome release - intelligent rolling tech breaks on one side and massive storming breaks and bass on the other
torontos stuart li can do almost any style of 4/4 dance music and sound like an expert he showed a near-perfect grasp of deep house on his motional response lp for still music while his nonplus releases had a rigidity borrowed more from techno the first release on his new label turns towards yet another dimension of his sound with three gristly analogue workouts full of spit and vinegar a welcome change from the smooth synths of motional response much like the work of his friend boddika the three tracks have a hardheaded feel with no polish or obvious sound design flourishes is one of the lumpier tracks of lis career running on an almost-broken beat that pits piano trills against a scruffy bassline that threatens to burst into full-on acid is a much twitchier affair where the snares snap and shudder outside the bounds of the kick drums the stuttering is only lent more madness with a smothering chord progression that twists itself in knots over the chaos below rounding things off has the steamrolling techno feel of his nonplus work only more aggressive the kick and snare combo sounds more like a foreboding march than something to dance to dd snarling hardware jams to the list of things we can expect to deliver
if you missed the first single on s new label of the same name dont sleep on the second like mojuba fdf is starting to become a seriously listenable and highly collectable imprint and while may not reach the heights of fdfs debut this second instalment comes pretty close packing in plenty of smooth deepness into two widely varied sides as on the previous outing the a-side comes courtesy of klaus rakete and mirko hunger in their guise this time however theyve traded in the ominously brooding and glacial dub step/dub techno sound for ethereal dub house poised somewhere on the edge of sleep drifts between an almost inaudible heartbeat bass and a trickling brook of percussive flutters never quite awakening the echoing chords and hiss that work the spaces are reminiscent of rhythm and sound but the outcome is a bodiless drift into tranquillity rather than dancefloor mayhem for home listening it s a treat but djs will still find it useful for bridging sets or using it as a tool the flipside remix comes from little known taron-trekka last seen earlier this year on the brut label with so few sounds to work with its no surprise to hear them taking a similar pace and kick drum and maintaining the originals dreamy ebb and flow the mix however is far more bright-light and awake no doubt due to the fact that the duo layer on new sounds like a run of twinkling cocktail glass piano licks coupled with a slow-building percussive swagger this track eventually reveals itself as a suave and slow deep house hit simple but elegant sounds on both sides of limited and numbered white vinyl need i say more
who is this mysterious that the track title alludes to probably best known for his hit the red dress doesn t divulge too much info here but if is his muse then he must be quite the indistinguishable character as there is nothing much that separates this deep housey number from the rest of the pack clocking in at just over six minutes at the end i found myself wondering is that it perhaps the fact that is only included as a bonus tune on the cd version of s new album is telling of its stature subtly builds with continuous chord loop kind of plateaus and then peters away and that really is about it and must have thought the same thing as they inject some much needed substance into with their remix slapping on their seventies porn star moustaches jazz things up literally providing a spaced out airy wash over the entire affair the pair add a much needed keyboard solo into the mix and take things back to the smooth sounds of the boogie nights era coooool the remix has definitely given the track a bit more punch but i can t help but feel like the original was unfinished leftovers from the album sessions
the heavily funk-influenced sound that london grime producer showcased on his debut irmiles ep for planet mu took the r flirtations of producers like src and terror danjah to a natural extreme smoothing out grimes bone-rattling percussion and spongy lfo the producers debut for lands with a much harder-edged bounce has all the trappings of a big tune feigning a slow dramatic intro of noodling synths and silky washes before dropping into a bassline that sounds like it crawled grumbling from a sewer lmost reminiscent of a more uptempo space dimension controller ebop neutralizes the corrosive textures with forcefully driving sections that nonetheless are careful not to puncture the schmaltzy bubble built around the dreamy synths and buttery-smooth vocoders the ep ends with trending topic where the tongue-in-cheek jazz mood holds on despite a tumbling bassline upbraiding it the entire time with remains firmly committed to the grime tradition and happily ignores it all the same
rumour has it that ricardo villalobos is an valon emerson fan and the b-side of makes it clear why tribal snaking and groovy is emerson at her most psychedelic the kind of tune villalobos would unleash with the flick of a fader on a sweaty 9 m dance floor its also the berlin-based artist at her most reduced burrowing into your brain with latin-style percussion oddball effects booooing whoosh and a restless bassline early on the groove gives way to a deranged melody for a wacky beatless moment resetting the energy before the bassline drags you back to the party blend of the bizarre and the functional is a return to the murky terrain recently heard on emersons remix of octo octas drift is the obvious big-room option rich with synths that twinkle above a blunt kick drum its more michael mayer than villalobos melodic and dreamy without much rhythmic flair its another trancey techno tune that will slot right into modern festival sets but adventurous djs will reach for the more original b-side
s dub infused breaks sound is definitely taking shape lately espeically after the respect their last single west london recieved from the breakbeat massive danny and spee team up once again and feature on a dark ragga breaks number based on billie holidays strange fruit - spee on the mic making a commentary on racial indifference in todays society side a1 original mix a solo trumpet sample kicks off this tune then danny brings the intricate drum beat in its a bit of a rolling break and uses a lot of drum fills throughout the track spee starts off his vocals with some sinister ghost like howls before getting stuck into his rap typical of the sound this track also features ragga bass lines and most importantly - the bass drops (to be said in a deep bassy and menacing voice) - enough to shake the speakers side a2 hell dub the hell dub is a hip hop tempo version of the tune spees vocals are cut down to short vocal stabs and ex-renegade soundwave dj aj is on the cut with some kick ass scratches a short breakdown in the middle and this tune is doubletiming to drumnbass tempo in the jump-up stylee should be a good one for junglist fans out there side b1 gurner dub the gurner dub takes away a lot of the bass and the bass drops and concentrates more on emphasising the melody and the drums spees vocals still feature in short snippets and there are a couple of bass drops included but for the most part the gurner dub is a dj tool which can be used to raggify a breaks track or just take out the bass for one track in a mix side b2 journey dub this is the real dub version of the original tune it takes out most of spees lyrics and leaves little snippets of it (like the last three) if you cant get into spees dark vocals then this (and the gurner dub) is probably the best mix for you not a bad tune however it doesnt feel as catchy as west london for fans of ragga beats and breaks this one is a definite for the record box
with its luxe pads and rctic-white sheen is my favourite of dev pandyas many projects its the ambient jungle counterpart to his acrobatic drum workouts as paradox tracks like rcosphere and oreal count among his best this 12-inch is the first new music in a few years it doesnt play to the projects strengths as much as the last few records but its a welcome return to melody and texture from a gifted percussionist on the more energetic of the two tracks synths are plush and introspective the bassline fits the drums like a glove under one of s signature uplifting chord progressions ut theres a vocal sample that doesnt quite fit the mood and the track starts to unravel with its half-time rhythm gives fans what theyre craving its interesting to hear pandyas drums like this they shift slowly and deliberately but their gated impact still hits like a punch its easygoing but purposeful which balances pandyas impulses if most of his work shows off his breakbeat programming skills then is about songwriting for half of this 12-inch pandya shows how great he can be at it
i have to say from the outset that i quite like nick warren as a dj in the past he has been criticised for his mixing in particular but i must say that all the times i have seen this man live i have never left disappointed being a great live dj and release a quality mix compilation though are 2 entirely different things and the crew at obviously believe he can do both as gu028 shanghai is the 5th global release from nick warren and after numerous listens of this album i have to agree with the boxed boys as this is another very enjoyable album from nick the first cd is delightful beginning with a smooth breakbeat intro thanks to sj esau the stunning aural imbalance remix of somehow is another one of those stunning early highlights thanks to some smooth beats and a great atmosphere that is set throughout the production the early part of this mix is simply breathtaking again showed through the deep basslines and lush melodies of the sunseeker remix of alex stealthy s once the groove continues thanks to way out west tini tun and then starecase while seyton s the drake equation is quite eerie yet seductive at the same time bcml deliver an intense progressive number with the delicious mr horowitz while the quasar remix of pillow is haunting with its smooth crisp beats and gritty basslines gardner star mix of solace ends the mix in a nice way thanks to some smooth electric riffs and cut up vocal hooks the second also begins smoothly with the natural highs of chimera a smooth broken beat track that leads into the more gritty and driving sounds of shiloh s remix of morozov s fly guitar it s clear to see that warren won t hold back in this disc as he smoothly moves into the uplifting sounds and summery vocal vibes of conversations by pop shuvit the amateur guitar mix of holden thompson s fantastic come to me builds the mix towards a peak time edge an edge that is clearly visible with the pulsating sounds of synthetic symphony some acid house enters the fray with hardfloor s acperience while the greek maestro in kosmas epsilon continues to keep the mix flowing with the epic sounds of sorry to be rude marcel schonbrann keeps the beats flowing intensely with maleta while peter martin s grace signals the beginning of a quite simply stunning last 20 minutes to this mix grace is a beautiful production and it leads delightfully into mercurio s simple things a track full of crisp beats and simply stunning spine tingling emotive string patterns the glorious sounds and emotions run high into derek howell s breathtaking your touch a track that concludes the album in a perfect fashion this is quite a strong mix from warren a mix that shows that he will always stick to his strong roots and not follow any bandwagons a point that i wish i could apply to a lot more djs out there it s an album full of melodies driving moments and most of all some good depth it s an album that shows that nick warren with all his experience and knowledge still knows how to deliver a good old fashioned solid mix compilation
up next on the imprint is a pretty interesting two track release from village man begins the release with a pretty moody breaks track that flows along smoothly with some subtle but solid sounds no obvious riffs or sounds but some deep basslines and intricate effects make this track quite nice and almost progressive in its nature the stunt is definitely a more peak time party breaks track the drums are a lot more imposing and the rolling basslines go quite well with the big main room synths that travel through this track throughout very heavy and imposing stuff here on the flipside and definitely one for peak time hour
considering that the majority of their solo releases tend to be dense and concept-driven the delivery mode of lva noto and byetones material is pleasingly straightforward essentially a series of five standalone techno 12-inches intended to be collated at projects end each one arrives free of thematic baggage and ready to be taken entirely at face value the duos co-opting of blue-sky-thinking corporate soundbites as track titles nicely hammers the point home: the presentation suggestively hints toward some deeper meaning while tacitly acknowledging that in actual fact what you see (and hear) is exactly what you get cross the 12-inches released to date what you got were precision-tooled and impeccably sculpted club tracks powered by the duos characteristic strobing rhythms and flecked with absurdist humour texturally is much the same as its predecessors: all chrome surfaces buffed to a high sheen tides of digital distortion rushing through the midrange and drums that hit with enough force to punch right through the surrounding melee rhythmically however its rather more fleet-footed both on and its alternate version on the flip move with a fast-paced distinctly electro-leaning bent with the latters tightly coiled bassline and springy percussion recalling paranoiac recent material by dj stingray of is more thick-set and ponderous but compensates with brute force pairing fist-shaped bass blasts with synth slashes that cut deep notches into its surface theyre the best of the duos missives to date by turns tough austere and playful

s befits its name the stateside imprint is made up of a small roster of artists scattered across the country that share a penchant for merging techno dubstep and idm sounds for the labels third release chicago-based artist makes his production debut with this 0-inch record which checks off all the right boxes with two immaculately produced pieces of hybrid dance music begins with a psychedelic sitar-like drone which buzzes along as intricate layers of percussion are smoothly filtered in and out of the mix those drums are insistent but never peak-time intense and there are no long breaks or dramatic transitions in sight such effects are not required to enjoy this warm hypnotic brew more grit is added with nchored by deep sub-bass riffs its dubstep-ish rhythm lacks a beat at the end of each measure; in its place jabs of glitchy high end finish off a constant call-and-response motif long cymbal splashes and increasingly visceral synth swells add texture and tension as things lurch to and fro but its the final minute of the track that will stick in your head as pietro pulls back from the gloom and settles into one final glacial tone its a tease for sure but at least its a beautiful one
the third release from sees them pulling out the tribal/percussive beats that seem to be so popular in the world of progressive house lately side a original mix soft bass elastic beats and of course the beat drops which feature so commonly in progressive house tunes definitely one to be used early in a set especially if it is meant to be a dark one side b oryan mix cleaner beats to start things off this side uses a slower build up adding in elements as discreetly as possible starting with just a lonely bass drum and adding in the funk as it moves along definitely one for the build up section of a set interesting drop in the middle losing all elements except for the one synth sound you wouldnt be able to tell this was a build up track until the elements kick in again
hotflush boss paul roses techno-oriented alias has surfaced sparingly this year with a few remixes and an original production dissipate on nonpluss think nd change compilation this two-tracker precedes decembers worldwide release of update a mini-retrospective of scuba/ tracks that were released in the us earlier this year is the beast here everything about it appears ominously from the windswept urban field recording of its opening 90 seconds to the pounding kick that finally breaks the introductions uneasy calm the addition of tough percussion and a bass synth which evokes an eagle swooping for its prey will make this one perfect for doomy moments in dark rooms s percussion is looser and more tumbling with gentle house chords brushing up against the kick as snares and tottering drums shimmer in the background on the surface its a lighter counterpart to the opener but its main elements eventually coalesce into something no less floor-ready
as producers who enjoy warping house music blueprints porn sword tobacco and svn have a lot in common but they also have their own way of doing things the former is a sample enthusiast who digs for obscure sounds thinly slices them and tosses them into downcast mechanical atmospheres svn on the other hand raises faint pulses from salvaged circuitry whisking them into strange mesmerising rhythms feels good finds porn sword tobaccos methods submerged into svns thick stew particularly on the a-side instead of creating a forward motion the hand percussion on feels like its falling as each drum lands it creates a ripple effect you can hear pieces of hand percussion and small modular noises bobbing around in the shallow pool new details emerge with each listen every note as small as a swab the two stripped-back tracks on the b-side are more recognisable vessels for the pairs hypnotic house formula the former in the vein of a dj sotofett record the latter a bit harder yet even in its diluted form their shared sound remains potent

buffalo new york based techno experimentalist has been relatively prolific over the past few years with records and remixes issued on labels like prologue semantica and vian since the late 90s though the bulk of his output has come through his own imprint is s most recent vinyl and while the range of analog sounds should be familiar to fans his fluctuating rhythms are as fascinating as ever take the nearly nine minute long side track s utumn remix of the club ready by pple (both versions were released digitally on intermission ltd in late 011) s is usual with s reworks it has basically nothing in common with the source material there are no cymbals no claps and crucially there is no clear separation of measure nchored by a lone kick drum this one is fit to go on without end relying on the tension created by an irregularly placed burst of noise and long lines of squiggly acidic tracers on the flip two shorter untitled originals work with spiraling riffs that are tied a bit more firmly to the beat my favorite of the pair is the a hypnotic half time groove thats both spooky and seductive overall shows off a less physically intense side of s style in comparison to say his recent remix for vian but these distinctively mind bending tracks should still prove potent in the hands of more adventurous djs
when peverelist and kowton first joined forces with asusu it was a spectacular meeting of the minds here were three artists all with distinct and recognizable styles laying down a new map for where bass music could go became one of dance musics most exciting and dependable labels always with the same three producers making great records with dnuos ytivil theyve brought in outside artists reverse vol 1 collects tracks from this cast of likeminded peers highlighting s curatorial knack the most obvious torchbearer of livitys sound is jacob martin aka he hails from their home base of bristol has collaborated with peverelist and featured on the main label his two contributions are reverse s highlights and you could easily be fooled into thinking they were livity rather than ytivil martin kicks things off with a track full of wobbly drums and eerie vocal samples is sinister tribal house that bangs with an almost foreboding sense of funk martin sounds like hes purposefully trying to fit in with pev and co but it works these were the tracks that helped establish martin as one of the uks most exciting dance music producers the other artists take more liberties with livitys formula allowing their personalities to reshape its style rather than the other way around who inaugurated dnuos ytivil back in 2012 dominates the comp with four tracks his cowbell heavy feels irreverent next to the greyscale seriousness of his own brash dub informed or the crash bang of s which viciously incorporates the dynamics of modern grime into livitys floaty template s contributions are particularly wonky ( is basically raw code crumpled up like a piece of discarded paper) while who living in france is livitys only continental artist so far offers a techier perspective in line with countrymen like nsdos and french fries vol 1 ends with peverelist remixing s the only appearance from one of the head honchos tellingly it outshines nearly every other tune here balancing pevs unmistakable swing with the stoic thrust of the best tracks the rework points towards how he kowton and asusu have formed a rock solid aesthetic one that newcomers may still be wrapping their heads around but maybe thats how it should be where the main label highlights the common ground between its core artists dnuos ytivili underlines the differences between the others vol 1 isnt the triumph that the first comp was but it shows that dnuos ytivil is off to a great start
head back to the label that released calling me one of their early successes with their grittiest most minimal offering yet here youll find none of the jinking pads or vocal cooing that offset flo jam s menacing bass instead judders to a sustained and rising assault of bass and wooden cowbells mournful hammond organ refrain takes the edge off it and thats that considering that several of their recent eps most notably for us were spilling over with tracks its hard not to feel a little shortchanged dubstep pioneer benny works acid squiggles tambourines and rat-a-tat percussion into his mix while the digital-only remix ditches the acid and replaces it with a jaunty riddim wrapped in a blanket of frothing snares
brussels is a sort of descendant of l e s terroriser beau wanzer both draw on ebm and industrial both revel in slasher-flick ugliness and both smear their productions with distortion and noxious delay this return to mazzocchettis first home purveyors of grotesk techno strengthens the similarities his ghoulish mumbling and razorwire synths suggest a bedroom recluse with unwholesome proclivities but as with much of wanzers music the hint of a dance floor sensibility makes these tracks more than just alienating two (relatively) straighter bangers grab your attention first and are to electro what a weeping wound is to healthy pink skin the synth work is angry the drums puckered and hot to the touch on the latter mazzocchetti finds a predatory lope not far from gesloten cirkel or randomers huh the rest of the ep is weirder cranks down the tempo and smothers its queasy melody in strange flanger effects on mazzocchettis vocal comes closest to intelligibility when its not plunging into acid baths of delay every now and then the shrill woodblocks of a cheap drum machine rise out of the ooze as if mockingly reminding us to dance
was behind the first oslo release in 2007 and here he returns to the german label which has since risen from relative obscurity to being one of the hottest imprints in the business well within the percussively funky spirit of oslo its bound to win even more fans over to the label starts things off with a thumping bass drum and simple subby bass line subtle elements of percussion are introduced throughout the arrangement until what sounds like a massive gong suddenly makes a loud appearance reverberated gong hits inaudible vocal snippets and the odd bleeps are then dispersed throughout the track building a tight groove that nonetheless leaves you waiting for something more e is on a housier tip: chords and clicks play around with the percussional vibes that have become a feature of oslo with the rhythm morphing and mutating throughout the track the third and final track is descriptively named a groovy little relaxed number that goes phey and then boom this 12 inch is yet another fine release that upholds oslos strong reputation for quality control the three tracks explore different aspects of a similar vibe but are all likely to go down well on dance floors where a house resurgence has created a longing for all things funky and groovy

the wide ranging r eye of liebe*detail is in full effect on their newest release pulling together ulgarian surrealist house producer and the welsh web development team manager by day house producer by night the duo seemingly have nothing in common on paper but both tracks feature twisted vocal samples as major plot points positions chiming bells around his chopped voice other bells provide a strange counterpoint reminiscent of four tet in their ability to simultaneously entrance and unsettle s aims at the end of the day are for the floor though and moves towards its climax with dogged purpose (even if it takes longer than a modern dance floor likely has the patience for to get there ) s has no such problems pounding a deep beat throughout almost all of its eight minute length resolutely straightahead its fascination lies in the way that plays with the bass and vocal in relation to one another one pushes the other pulls its the type of tune that does massive damage on a dance floor but never quite gets the recognition it deserves with the boost that it gains by virtue of being on liebe*detail expect to hear s a little more often in the coming months

when a label can be so bold as to pair source direct with demdike stare and blawan (and get away with it ) in between records from redshape eduardo de la calle and somne its time to just accept whatever they do next rather than simply live up to its name nonplus delivers with a consistency that goes beyond tempos genres and individual artists cue s entry into the fold the israelis tough take on tech house has made him a regular on the likes of ovum and renaissance (outside of his own be as one label) but dont pass judgement yet is nonplus through and through in the vocal loop and generally threatening demeanour resonates boddika joy orbison and some of the hits theyve concocted together but hasnt denied his roots altogether here: there are tech house allusions all beefed up and made to carry a weapon its a mean track bossy and overbearing too just dont fucking screw up on the b-side is less of an affront a dark itchy house number that rolls with little fuss

live and unplanned unmastered and recorded raw in stereo directly from the modular modular vol 2 comes right from the rehearsal tapes of uk analogue enthusiast and organizer of the freerotation festival starts off the ep in contemplative mode with a squirmy bassline that hugs the ground like an earthworm little bits of melody break off in squeaky chunks random but somehow flowing a byproduct of the modular method but from someone who really knows how to control the unwieldy platform more of a groover has a swing offset by some gravelly snares but its melody lines never really reach beyond minuscule blips like bleep techno at its most sedate does it one better taking the attempted slinkiness of and driving it home with a tight bassline that wriggles happily underneath melodies that resolve in a much more natural way modular wraps up with another slow-burning tune that bubbles and swells like an old hessle audio tune rendered in 16-bit

earlier this year it was with great sadness that we lost one of the veteran pioneers of the dance music scene when casper pound sadly passed away casper was a big part of label in its early years and the label pays respects to casper as a person and a wonderful production talent with the re-release of a production made famous in the early nineties by casper under guise on the a-side the track gets a fantastic reworking by one of the rising talents in orchid he i must say turns in a blinding remix that is sure to absolutely do the business worldwide the beats are crisp and intense from the word go and the track lifts a notch early on as a nice rolling baseline gives the track a solid foundation to work on emotive string patterns as well as some nice subtle vocal samples and melodic effects work their way into the smooth as silk production a production that takes a fantastic turn late on as the beats become quirky and full of life on the flip is the classic natural high mix the mix that was so destructive on the floors in the early 90 s it definitely has that early 90 s warm feel to it be it the distinctive piano lines of that era or the trademark drum patterns and bouncy primitive baselines a nice touch from re-releasing a classic past hit alongside a absolutely storming remix from a producer that will surely make his mark in the next year

there are few labels that manage to maintain high standards for a few years but in dutch label s case quality has been its byword since 996 lthough inspired by detroit techno and electro as well as chicago house the imprints strength lies in its rosters ability to reinvent these benchmark sounds that roster is the other reason: has never been shy about welcoming new artists to the fold and this remix project is a case in point while veteran dutch producer steve delivers a version of s that recalls the airy chord melodies of his sterac project underpinned by an electro bass and a rolling rhythm has recruited new generation producers shed redshape and for the other interpretations s take on s field is a dense dub techno track with the doubled up beats adding to the sense of claustrophobia while sheds take on the same track is a linear dubstep/techno shuffler but redshape steals the glory remixing isnt an easy task at the best of times but the masked man defies expectations: opening to the sound of someone doing a spot of diy in the background the happy jazzy chords that follow suggest that redshapes in a less menacing mood than usual but then he lets loose one of his droning grinding basslines and once again plays to the labels strength of mixing the classic and new

joe seaton is one of those rare artists whose ing is as distinctive as his music s do fudd elmo crumb the berlin based producers elegant techno can work a dance floor just as easily dip into downtempo jazz s a seaton makes these sort of contrasts sound natural is a showcase for his talents idiosyncrasies his skill lies not only in an ability to jump between styles genres but to do so in a way that feels intuitive the kind of whose transitions make you wonder why you havent thought of them yourself judging from his first official mix cd seaton knows his records so well that he could mix any two from his collection without overthinking it take the opening section: he starts with s gorgeous jazz inflected collaboration with a track that morphs gracefully into house as tunes by play underneath where s synths jumpstart the mix into full bore techno is the first of many alchemical moments transition is so quick that it seems accidental yet too perfect to be anything other than deliberate res another great moment two tracks later when seaton brings in s dreamy traenon slowed down so it sounds more like breaky techno than 90s drum bass elsewhere archival material from dm producer rubs up against a track; obscure uk electro heads sit next to ; a 2016 production from ( k burnt friedman tom ) melts into s n seatons h s genres eras dont matter he finds a way to make everything fit into his peculiar universe s eclecticism brings to mind nina kravizs recent mix for fabric like seaton kraviz mashed up the old with the new the wacky with the dead serious but where kravizs cd focused on the heady techno that defines her sets seatons expresses the colour vibrancy of his productions cephale cephale are centrepieces on one is a stunning downtempo moment in a fizzy bath of synths the other brings the mix back to techno both are couched in the gentle melodies relaxed arrangements that make his work so lush quirky side of seatons personality emerges at the mixs wonderful confusing closing section he lets the groove unravel over an acapella from a 1940s blues howler over the backdrop of nkersmit s voice is totally anachronistic which is the point ce seaton moves into the funk of s way it all makes sense hitting heavier higher emotional points than most other mixes seaton has said that was inspired by late hours sets but that doesnt exactly do this mix justice re are reflective moments there are fist pumping jams there are the kind of left turns you would hear in the final bleary eyed moments of the night when only the hardiest stragglers are left st ing like the best mixes in the fabric series seatons st s on its own its not meant for any time but the moment you put it on t channels the feeling of dancing all night to your favourite in your favourite club with an evenings worth of twists turns surprises delights packed into an 80 minute set that is as much of an artistic statement as any of seatons excellent records
chicagoan chrissy murderbot is behind the dizzying my year of mixtapes project 52 dj sets that roamed all over but whose true heart was in the breaks-and-bass mutations of the first half of the 90s murderbots label issues music with the same basic thrust as this ep demonstrates in spades is from bristol so hes no stranger to rave history and offers an ingenious twist to the spate of early jungle redux weve heard lately: the twittering helium diva here is none other than lil wayne its a perfect lift: waynes mixtape track i feel like dying is like 93 darkcore made back into the hip-hop it took off from kinetic spins it back faster again with wayne now chanting i feel like dying i feel like dying like hes made up his own words to the ice cream truck parked outside kinetics original is very euro-hardcore with scraping synth riffs reminiscent of human resource but its 3d kick drums bring it into the present day he turns that trick even further out on the eps finale which commingles euro-blaring rhythm riffs and 4 hero-style pitch-shifted drums to eye-popping effect both remixes are strong new yorker kingdom furthers his hot streak with a shadowboxing subwoofer workout; a gaseous hands-in-the-air keyboard riff surfacing about three minutes in makes it even ravier krazy s mix is more carnivalesque a liquid tropical bounce with sharp snares and waynes chant tap-dancing all over it an also-ran in this company gives dubstep wobble some heat and energy
italian producer sits in the noisy techno camp between vatican shadow and the many projects of shifted emphasis on between his music keeps one foot in abstraction and one somewhere near a dance floor forgetting his techno-oriented work as one half of violetshaped his first release for is his most snarling music yet starts with the promise of a beat but the crooked gait is pulled apart into heart-stopping throbs that plunge into silence d feels like an old rave tape-pack sped-up and half lost to decay cribbing from the early vatican shadow playbook the title track scrapes at a dramatic string sample with washes of face-melting noise that spirit carries over to which is essentially a sheet of smouldering white noise rhythm is re-introduced on but here its curdled and noxious ep winds down with a corrosive nightcap in which is so chewed-up its barely recognizable as music over and over again whats most impressive about s hellish sound is its intensity it feels like hes constantly trying to outmuscle the entire noise techno movement and so even when he doesnt sound wholly original you cant deny his power
s career as a recording artist was as sporadic as it was exemplary in 1976 his black truth rhythm band released their only album ifetayo which was a calypso record with an emphasis on west frican music imos best record the disco soca seven-inch -jah emerged two years later in the mid-70s soca the lord shorty-engineered successor to calypso was emerging in trinidad imos home country us soul and funk were staples of trinidadian radio and haitian and jamaican music was popular too but imo was drawn to west frica a region whose highlife sound bubbled on the surface of his catalogue where ifetayo merged calypso with funk and frobeat in an easygoing style -jah turned towards disco with earnest spiritual overtones on the vocal version imo and an uncredited female singer trade devotional chorus and verse over organ funk sweet synth harmonies churning bass and dub-style sparks between her crisp shouts of praise him imo plays trumpets drums and cymbals as though his instruments might have the agency to respond later he sings let everything that breathe the breath of life / praise praise he the lord run by brandon hocura and gary bugan has reissued rare music from zambia south frica and the us but it has given special focus to trinidad the 12-inches the label has sourced from the caribbean island have what bugan calls a refraction of styles stephen encinas disco illusion and michael boothmans touch were disco records with alien touches soca disco dub and gospel come together with the same ineffable clarity on -jah
s original is something like a shoegaze ballad mostly divorced from the techno context of the rest of its parent album on your own again thats what the remixes are for both remixers pretty much gut out the original completely doing away with its dramatically lumbering pace and thick filtered guitars barcelona duo downliners sekt do that most literally replacing the jesus mary chain atmosphere with a spectral soundscape about as spooky as their own forlorn productions their mix buries a broken 2-step beat somewhere in the usual sea of tape hiss and effects anxious irregular chords pushing the whole thing along while the vocals murmur like a wounded lounge singer uk house rising star t williams on the other hand fashions a typical lengthy club jam out of it dipping into the same pop house water as his recent remix of maya jane coles for a jacking workout complete with raucous chicago chords and little bubbles of acid too glossy and eminently bassy to be revivalist
s early productions were dense and his overstuffed work usually ended up getting lost in a sea of similarly abstract hip-hop peers was inescapably amateurish lo-fi and underdeveloped and prone to bouts of attention deficit disorder yet charming all the same this year however when henry laufer re-appeared on adopted home with the ep all his best attributes were sewn tightly into a single conceptual template s it turns out is one scrappy young artist who cleans up really nicely was woodsy and folksy laufer adorning his beats with strummed and plucked guitar rather than the found sound and synth outfits on his previous work s it turns out second album is completely of a piece with its first single laufer sticks resolutely to a simple instrumental setup guitars (acoustic and electric) drums and his vocals but the configurations he thinks up are vastly different from softly clicking beats to loud distorted shoegaze washes to jazz guitar noodling the latter is always expressed in his trademark fractious manner spidery riffs that branch out like cracks in stained glass the story arc on the ominously-titled is cyclical moving from peaceful to anxious back to peaceful again over the course of thirteen songs the records first few tracks run together like a suite with continuing in a more downtrodden jazzy manner the album shifts gears with the deceptively jaunty which descends into the mock-paranoia of where a guitar melody spirals and floats like a firefly painting a trial in pitch black night from there the titular vibes start to blot out the sky and the album descends into a passage of downright frightening faux-shoegaze laufers guitar and vocal moans are exploded draping the musical background with their sustained and distorted fragments for all of its improvements isnt some magical makeover its just tighter and more focused sounds like a bedroom album the kind of thing someone makes alone after periods of intense concentration and solitude with the albums preference for guitars and gently nostalgic melodies comparisons to dm stalwarts like boards of canada are almost guaranteed but it has more in common with the populist hip-hop/bass pastiche of fellow labelmates like salva and ernest gonzales s another triumph for and its a breakthrough for a young producer finally emerging with an individual and inventive style previously hinted at
when i recently called maoupa mazzocchetti a descendant of beau wanzer i wasnt aware this family reunion was in the works recorded when wanzer was visiting mazzocchettis brussels home the crepes ep has the sound of long-lost relatives who discover they smoke the same brand of cigarettes and share a distinctive laugh sometimes you can tell who did what the voice that appears on the noxious grizzled and groaning and ravaged with fx sounds like mazzocchettis but the two mostly work in diabolical harmony from the deformed faces on the cover to the dance floor perversions within not to mention the viscous coating of delay and distortion any of the eps creative decisions could have come from either of these twisted minds crepes tackles an array of rhythmic forms groaning throbbing d missionne is electro and probably the eps most vivid moment does techno in a sluggish way while has more bite with serrated percussion flying furiously over an angry kick drum most striking tracks explore extremes of tempo is fast locked in strange jittery stasis at 160 bpm n theres the sub-90 bpm of whose acrid effects congeal into a hellish down-pitched voice mazzocchettis again presumably

one new yorks most trusted purveyors analog brews jorge velez k uses his new single to break ground on his own new ny-centric label one designed with a modest but intriguing agenda: 7-inches only if this might seem at first like an unusual undertaking this single quickly makes clear that oddly enough the format the 7-inch one the oldest incarnations waxen tunes has become timely again in in an era when were both culturally over-stimulated and excited by retro or neo-classic projects the 7-inch fers up old-time vibes but condensed into a smaller more immediately-digestible package perfect for a 21st-century attention span were busy were distracted if youve got something to fer give it to us straight hit us right between the eyes which -side happily does smacking you right in the ears with a blast bouncy italo driven by nice steely-slick hi-hats and roughshod bass it practically begins in media res: with this format you get about three-and-a-half to four minutes per side so extended intros and outros are out the question runs out the gate as if its opening build-up has been rudely lopped f and then disappears without so much as a handshake goodbye the tunes got enough steam that it could easily go on longer play this out and you might find yourself wanting doubles something almost unthinkable when it comes to extended 12-inches or loop-able mp3s compared to its breezy uptempo counterpart feels dense and a bit disorienting as if its own solution to 7-inches wasnt to strip down but to bulk up cramming twice as much sound into half the space much like when you have to smush all your travel souvenirs back in the suitcase before heading home despite its heft still soars in part thanks to a thoughtful mix job which heavily stereo-pans a set spooky choir voices while some sort basement machine rumbles deeply in the middle so murky it sounds like its coming from next door onky hi-nrg synths do most the grunt work darting and stabbing across one another nd just when you feel youve made sense the tune its gone like a weird dream perhaps unsurprising coming from an artist named for a little nemo character
s debut 12-inch last year was shaded with a nostalgic autumnal quality adding a bit more flair to what could have been a typical slab of edits returns almost exactly a year later here a little more energetic and even more adventurous showcases a gift for arrangement as a chiming guitar riff slowly crawls out from underneath some dusty bongos throw in a walking bassline strings and some distant vocals (and flutes ) and youve got nine captivating minutes that boils over for a satisfying 30 seconds before receding back into its crackly vinyl haze the disco is balanced with two more of those hypnagogic interludes with saggitarius with quarius and especially the ballroom waltz of reminiscent of ghost box and their eerie evocations of childhood audibly aged sound and warbly melodies then theres a based off a simple clipped phrase its one of those magical little bars where the guitar lick feels more electric every time it repeats teases out new sounds until a kick drum takes over and the entire thing is a shimmering mass of contagious ecstasy

drian niculae might be minimals new king of shuffling loops est known for his work as priku this ucharest native has been churning out addictive groove-led tracks for more than five years t times his functional and positive sound isnt far removed from aracs perennially charming aesthetic niculaes latest release under his birth name comes via a new label hes launching with this two-track 12-inch s track names 001 1 and 001 2 are dryly titled but the music is full of character the -side is the pick of the record: built with a bassline that becomes increasingly trippy shuffling percussion and a collage of pleasantly abstract synth snippets its the kind of track that despite being on the mellow side would stand out in any well-considered set like the most effective minimal 001 1 features all kinds of strange sounds you cant quite put your finger on but is also easy to find warmth in -side 001 2 is more trancey and less original it too would send a dance floor into a daze but it doesnt match the subtle ingenuity of its counterpart
and are two well known london producers working under different names anonymity is beyond tired in the world of techno by now but the duos new records label gets off to a strong enough start that we can look past the clich d identity politics each producers personality comes through on his solo track specializes in a subterranean strain of techno and balances a funky bassline with eerie atmospherics its flighty compared to the ironclad thwack of s pockmarked and gritty where is pristine has the erratic quality of old hardware corralled into a quantized grid those roughshod sounds return for a collaboration by the duo and the eps obvious standout and s abilities lock together like jigsaw pieces the leaden kick drums work in tandem with s tribal touch and a shroud of ambience smooths out the more abrasive elements

with s second release the labels name makes perfect sense: this crew of musicians from the dresden elbe valley has a truly uncanny knack for the particulars of american house you could figure that much out even without s guest vocal on s in which the veteran detroit producer and dj sends shout outs to dresden house heads alongside motor city figures like omar s mike huckaby and detroit itself repeatedly detroit detroit detroit: its easy to get hung up in hagiography but when the homage is made with this much obvious love (and talent) everyone wins compared to his records for dolly and left of the dial its a distinctly different vibe for sounding more like philpots carefree jazzy slightly quirky jack mode and with vibraphones tumbling like the flakes in a snow globe its one of the most innocent joyful things to come around in a while other three tracks show off s considerable range who also appeared (as did ) on the labels first ep delivers a shuffling mid tempo rhodes driven groove full of chunky sampled percussion and blues vox sampled keys are especially clever with long fluid lines chopped up into one shots and marched up and down the scale has clearly been listening to pepe bradock and pal joey and he achieves a similarly deep fusion of hip hop and house from sounds like something you might find on workshop or mikrodisko with its lumbering bass and slightly sticky feel as detuned keys warble over flanged hi hat and 808 cowbell its not the most immediate cut on the ep but its the kind of track that when the time is right you expect will enliven an impromptu mix showing its true colors in the proper context who also makes his debut appearance here dials the fluttering all the way down to 1 bpm turning out an analog throb somewhere between oneohtrix point nevers arpeggiated grind and chloes andante acid unlike many such slow motion efforts it makes the most of its painstaking crawl reveling in off beat hits and ungainly waveforms
title of s recent single for enklav simple straight raw gives you a sense of what hes about london-based italians latest ep switches focus from boshing ghetto house to something closer to home uk funky is a pronounced influence on sacred drums : with its minor-key string melodies and rolling soca-like syncopations is one of the more successful recent attempts to refresh the style elsewhere similar elements thundering snare rolls percussion flourishes distant whoops and birdcalls are built into more universal drum tools lean dramatic and groove-focussed these tracks could work equally well in a livity sound set at a janus party or in a sweaty techno basement builds the suspense with whipcrack snares and throbbing low-end other tracks go for peak-time is a punishing midrange assault: squeezes the odd dissonant string chord in there otherwise its all drums assams shifts the rhythmic focus onto layers of bouncing claps giving the syncopations more air to breathe two digital bonus tracks stretch the eps refined palette a bit thin but it doesnt really matter 12-inch is a drumophiles embarrassment of riches

s second lp ear drums black holes exaggerated the skyward-looking nature of his ambitious instrumentals but was weighed down a number of vocal tracks (as ever mixed results) six months or so after that albums release on planet mu the philadelphian producer embarks on a series of ep releases for that see him not so much regressing as playing to his strengths space traitor vol 1 almost makes it seem like ear drums never happened hearkening back to the mostly instrumental flourishes of his debut ephemeral exhibits but a meaner edge opener does a demented skip before breaking out into the kind of stomach-churning melodies that has established himself on: where so many other american producers hijack the midrange frequencies for harsh wobbling basslines uses the same spectrum to bolster his pop-calibre melodies for the rest of the tracks notches up the drama orchestra and all and are a natural pair taking flight bombastic orchestral sections and woodwind flourishes but its s second collaboration vocalist after stars that is the eps shining star seizing on the cinematic pomp and placing the orchestral samples in a lilting balladic template unwittingly constructs one of the most gut-punching and brutally emotional tunes of his career only creeping strings and delicately tickled piano s vocal is lovely vacillating between sweet siren and arch regality just as s rather complex melody shifts from lilt to graceful ascent the eps digital package is rounded off by six remixes most of which are superfluous perhaps needless to say a masterful pop number like need not be remixed though theres something to be said for egyptrixxs typically dive-bombing remix of and ital teks earthy rework of but the eps five original tracks reaffirm as one of the most lovably idiosyncratic producers to emerge out of the nebulous dubstep field one uncommon and uncanny melodic prowess
craig mcwhinney is a melbourne house and techno producer best-known for his work alongside fellow australians mike callander and christian vance they make a formidable team but to me mcwhinney has always been the pick of the three specialising in a swung dj-friendly style suited to a variety of sets and selectors hes still a relatively unknown name internationally with just a handful of overseas dates and releases somewhere along the line though he caught the ear of patrik skoog whose sample + hold label recently began with one of the best techno 12-inches of last year skoogs sh01 mcwhinneys is another quality release for a label thats cementing itself as one to watch like sh01 the mood on is gloomy although this one also sounds sinister its a quality that makes it a little less versatile than most tool-techno but it should be dangerous in the right hands heavily broken beats are the main feature of the eps two standout cuts is the most spacious with heavy reverb and lots of weight down low while is more abrasive those playing at peak-time will likely reach for or both tracks are galloping and bass-heavy prime material for djs unafraid to inject some gloom into a party
if its conceptually rigid monad series or distinctive record sleeves didnt tell you berlin-based has a preoccupation with design both sonic structural its an attention to detail that pulls its releases off the dance floor (though they work there too) into a world of obsessive minutiae work of singaporean producer has been the flagship for this aspect of the label crafting techno out of tricks of the light music that sounds curiously devoid of grounded physicality yet thundering all the same where s previous work for the label was often doled out in lengthy expanses of brushed metal on his third album first for sa hes allowed to stretch out or rather pull closer inward conventional techno structures (the kind of his first two albums) are ab oned in favour of a neurotic idm clutter the blistering opening stretch of pairs a pounding skitter with fluid countermelodies polished chrome means everything feels like its constantly slipping off of something else such a frantic constant state of unstoppable motion its a wonder it doesnt simply catch fire explode though the thrilling little bits of glitch distortion on a track like come pretty damn close tracks like rself with its burning streaks of cyber-acid are beyond dense ripe for deconstruction any record with fifty minutes of intense sensory overload is bound to be well overload breaks up the monotony with gentle interludes that sacrifice none of the albums textural richness have the same blinding surfaces as the albums heaviest moments moves that also serve to show how eerily unsettling the spare parts of s slamming concoctions really are when they arent being attacked by frenzied percussion any relent is dissipated in the albums closing stretch however with the nine-minute workout recalling s earlier sa work the penultimate which caresses an elephantine lumber with strokes of synth that come the closest to warmth on a record composed almost purely out of cold metal if theres one quality that carries itself across the entire length of its the ability to shock awe impress: whether hes doing it through a lullaby or jackhammering your skull it might be difficult to parse at first but the gentle sequencing helps even then the album is only around fifty minutes long it just feels longer because has put a lifetimes worth of intense experience into in a world where numbingly brooding techno is rapidly becoming the st ard the reflections of light that s catches in its lightspeed moves are simply brilliant
brooklyn producer sits in an odd place: a supposed stalwart of the stalled us garage scene and todd edwards acolyte sees him more aligned with uk house getting particularly cozy with the crew they provided excellent remixes on his mind reader ep earlier this year and with he returns the favour with a proper release on the label each track shares in the springy cartoonish and rounded sounds so characteristic of but similarities to anything else end there theres something strangely urgent almost desperate about this music the way the sampled vocal chirps and tinny synths of are pulled down by the foggy dread of the bassline and how the horns jitter and shoot off uncontrollably in the faux-military-march of this emotional uncertainty is part of what makes the ep feel so unfamiliar implacable and strangely alluring; any attempt at categorization or pigeonholing simply slides down their smooth glassy surfaces whats most exciting about s sound is the percussion; each track here bubbles and fizzes exuberantly drums that not only sound unconventional but exist unconventionally they lend his music its semblances of melody instead of the synth melodies themselves which in turn feel more like polyrhythms to the point where the songs are dauntingly dense webs of interlocking sounds and patterns the odd track out is the eps centrepiece and certainly its best moment vintage 1970s synths molding and expanding like silly putty in the hands of some lithe and invisible higher power throw in pounding halfstep percussion tentative horn riffs and vocals that sound suspiciously like grace slick and youve got yourself a banger from another planet but even banger feels too restrictive a term as has constructed opuses here that work just as well on their own far removed from any notion of dance music maybe pop music from another planet is a better analogy as the unexpected vocal breakdown in will attest to where everything just melts away for a few bars to revel in the gorgeous glory of the human voice
for me the holidays often seem like an irritating melody repeated and stretched to mind-numbing monotony punctuated by staccato putdowns from family members lindstr m being the tongue-in-cheek genius that he is has tapped into that groundhog christmas day feeling and put out a 42-minute version of let me repeat that for you just for effect 42 minute it was inevitable i suppose when it comes to holiday cheer techno fans have had to subsist for too long on jingle cats and manheim steamroller thing is the track available as bonus with lindstr ms recent album with christabelle and as a standalone download elsewhere is insane when the iconic pah-rum-pah-pum-pum hook stabs at oh about the 10-minute mark its been chopping and skipping and fencing with a super mario bros jump sound for so long that it sort of gives you that hallelujah orgasm that certain boredoms tracks have perfected its basically the christmas miracle halfway through slabs of discordant string radiance start messing it up the melody dissolves and the whole shambling polar rave explodes into a trick crescendo that keeps spiraling upwards like a barber shop pole when the scene changes again we get muffled voices singing the ditty the effect is one of children singing up from a cavern through crystal tubes its oddly moving and im a guy who fucking hates christmas so kudos to hans-peter for degrinching me for three quarters of an hour in the last 10 minutes or so the little boy is joined by his big drummer daddies their big cymbal brothers and basically the whole percussion family banging pots and pans in honor of the nativity it even gets a disco bassline jesus wept i mean lets be fair this is a one-time listen the little drummer beat is a martial snare looped into the deepest folds of my cerebellum i dont need it ever again but if youre in the mood for a quiet evening of ketamine and eggnog i have just the track for you pah-rum-pah-pum-pum
one of this years most promising dj/producers makes his debut - and one worthy of taking note - on plastic pantastic with a tasty two header since his first release the more i know on portugals feed me records the spotlight has shone in davisons direction now as much in demand for his dj skills as for his penchant for creating solid dancefloor shakers on the a-side is whipping up a tech-infused sound of textured synthlines and incessant percussive patterns dictating the groove as this progresses sounds are subtly imitated and played about with the pressure drops off with squelchy delayed synth hits leading into a total breakdown before all the pieces are layered up and back into play again for maximum effect praying for patience is on the flip side creating a high octane dancefloor moment with use of busy tribal percussion together with cut up vocals twisting out a catchy rhythm all this gathers momentum then drops the beat as a watery mix of sounds takes over cranking back up with the addition of ricocheting stabs that build upon each other while a rich tapestry of entangled phrases work underneath throughout the track parts ease out to the fore and shift back into place gently keeping the pressure at maximum and only brought right down briefly for the short break superb work from davison with both tracks subtle at a glance but containing a weight of intricacy from start to finish
perhaps one of the most well known names in the dj biz is well known for embracing various styles throughout his long career - starting with acid house raves in the late 80s eventually evolving into the popular house techno and trance dj hes become known for as a producer he made his name with his first two album releases 1996s at the end of the cliche and 1999s phuture 2000 both released on his own worldwide ultimatum record label sees the release of his third artist album released on his new label 23rd century recordings - an appropriate title for a record label cementing carls constant outlook to the future is actually put together like a mix cd and features many collaborative works with highly acclaimed producers such as norman cook misstress barbara josh wink techno legend kevin saunderson and bristol drumnbass don roni size norman cook and carl are the first to pair up with the drum friendly thats the bass featured here as coxs rock drums mix where he makes use of a heavy rocking drum break and fatboy slim style bassline and vocal loops the album then moves onto summery vocal house with give me your love featuring the vocals of hannah robinson who sings atop a upbeat latin house groove laden with spanish guitar and soul claps 80s british jazz funk soul group light of the world provide the vocals for the discoey feel the real bringing back vocal phrases that have been used in many house tunes in typical 80s funk style carl backs them up with funky horn arrangments and disco guitar licks house producers phats small provide a funky tribal of if i fall (would you let me ) which feature the vocals of reprazent vocalist onallee who is transformed from the urban soulstress into a house diva the album moves into techno with on fire co-produced with misstress barbara the tune incorporates a melodic electro bassline and a quirky synth loop much in the style of the misstress herself before bringing back the funk on the bassline groovin aint it funky now - check the wicked horn sample which is reminiscent in some ways of that old bucketheads track from 1994 dirty bass with christian smith is exactly that - 3 different basslines throughout the duration of the tune all morphing in styles yet all very dirty valentino kanzyani presents an earresistable mix of give me your love porting it to the world of slamming dancefloor techno while putting hannahs vocals through various filters and effects as valentino lays down a massive synth hook and percussive break surprsingly enough roni size does not pull a drumnbass rabbit out of his hat for this album instead he and carl lay down a funky percussive rhythm combined with a jazzy bassline (very reminiscent to the one used in brown paper bag) while onnalee delivers a combination of sung vocals and philosophical spoken word to finish the album turns up the tempo kicking off with the goth-rock-meets-drumnbass of got what you paid for and closing the curtains with a latin drumnbass version of if i fall (would you let me ) with a fuller vocal effort by onnalee whats awesome about is that each tune flows very nicely into the next one which is pretty easy since it is presented as a continuous cd most mix cds arent this coherent and as enjoyable to listen to - it definitely takes a dj with the experience and versatility that carl has to be able to pull it off properly
is a prime example of a new generation of tech-savvy house producers he uploads new tracks often accompanied by a flashy gif to soundcloud and is tied-in with an international network of peers such as yaeji and dj boring for this crew who combine 80s-inflected synths with lo-fi percussion the adoption of lo-fi aesthetics doesnt feel confrontational rather its meant to evoke fuzzy nostalgia the way the palace clothing brand films its skateboard videos with old vhs cameras the tracking lines that run through the screen used to be an annoyance now they hearken back to a simpler time all that might put off trend-weary record collectors but the berlin-based producers new 12-inch for the new york label is a delight the label run by edgar rojas-masferrer puts its name on coffee clothing and records many of which fall somewhere between edits and airy house and boogie kandinskis fits the bill perfectly sampling a silky-smooth claude vonstroke banger punctuated by a sax that hangs in the air like an unanswered text kandinski shows off the two sides of his persona on the b-side with two versions of a track called the first is a restrained house track that combines moody pads and wonky percussion the way theo parrish did 20 years ago he dials it back for the other version which is credited to his 80s funk alias barry helafonte crawling along at 90 bpm it splits the difference between chopped and screwed and balearic a fitting end to an ep that feels rooted in dollar bin gems

re is a tracklisting to s mix for the fabric mix series but its often more cliffs tes than anything else by the fourth minute or so of fabric 53 id venture to guess that there are at least three different tracks playing at once maybe even more birmingham techno pioneer has pushed the art of digital ing further than almost anyone cutting piecing together tracks into a larger whole so expertly that you hardly think about the parts some s use laptops to spin records uses a laptop to transform them makes great however isnt that he piles tracks upon tracks ny digital these days can easily do the same s that hes a natural born storyteller master of suspense someone who knows when more exposition is needed someone who knows when the rug needs to get pulled away completely right when youre getting overwhelmed in that opening crush he clicks the mouse to bring in s clears the deck of almost everything else guess how well s s work in t em with one another solely by their evocative track titles genre wise fabric 53 is the dark to fabric 50 s light whereas dutch dubstepper martyn explored the intersection of four four breakbeat records at or near 30 bpm with a deft touch comes at it the opposite side ready to pummel the off s someone who once recorded as one half of a group called british murder boys this is to be expected is into going faster that said the slugabed remix of keys s feels like a weird inclusion until nnekas ethereal vocals gets twisted tortured eventually subsumed by luke slaters remix of s hard to say its an odd inclusion exactly only thing boring to most likely would be to follow the expected route keep vocals out of the mix entirely but it does take you slightly out of the intense pocket that has crafted for the previous hour or so n again the two epic techno tunes that eventually close things in stirring fashion arent all that either until you realize that maybe his mastery of digital ing has made more literally figuratively than he ever has been before
best things often come from the most unexpected places that ewan fresh from producing the rapture s new album and co-producing the gorgeous new partial arts 12 on kompakt should have chosen to remix sultry alt-country singer is unusual in itself but that the said remix should turn out to be a beautiful twelve-minute epic that sends umpteen shivers down the spine and is an early contender for one of the tracks of the year is quite a surprise tidwell s vocal suitably spacey and full of the unlikely passion tempered with uncertainty of new romance is isolated magnified and intensified in its prettiness and cast out into a fathomless galaxy of quietly building orchestral synths and beats that crunch delicately like expensive chocolates n as the song gathers pace the synths subtly peak ever so slowly before a huge breakdown reduces the track to just tidwell s breathy voice and an intense pulsing beat before building up again with renewed intensity re are instrumental and edited versions included on the ep plus tidwell s original version but the long-form remix is really all you need it s the perfect setting for the song all space desolation and perfect tiny details twinkling away in the background it s the aural equivalent of opening your curtains late at night and marvelling at the endless beauty of it all a perfect end-of-the-night tune
whenever a romboy collaboration is afoot at systematic the vs abbreviation always seems to slot itself in between the producer s names the ampersand is swept aside as if to set the stage for a battle of epic proportions well in that case in the red corner hailing all the way from sao paolo razil making his debut get ready for gui the hurricane orrrratttto well you get the idea ut this time the versus format is more justified than ever with each producer taking a side and going to work on a re oratto s of leads in with simple percussion and strings wisping behind the drums before dropping into an easy to digest trance y main section the bassline is warm and coupled with the strings and the ethereal vocals of ( oratto s wife) the result has a very late 90 s alearic feel to it it s a nice slice of dreamy house just like you d expect from gui romboy is also not one to stray too far from the sound he s known for and as you d expect his version is much darker and sinister the backbone of the track the dark robotic bassline with a trippy oscillating synth attached is introduced early on and remains a constant throughout the breakdown hisses and builds epically but typically slumps back down to where it began and the outro is more of the same this track really holds few surprises but will find its way into the bags of djs on a dark trance y tech tip this release is nothing too surprising but a decent add to the collection

is the second ep from london-based production duo and right now after the world has had ample months to digest the wonder of their debut 12-inch fully drowning in the astringent twists and the hip-hop template the pair hang their dubstep influences off of seems like the optimum time for the world to embrace it title track is to date the most dance floor directed production the pair have released easing its see-sawing keyboards around swollen pockets of high pitched melody before the jagged edged square wave bassline erupts amongst the click clack of the semi-quantized percussion its chock full of pure smile-time synthesized vibes that will undoubtedly keep any dance progressive and interesting; a carbon opposite of the moody guitar-led title track from their first ep which the second track on here evokes; its swathes of mellotron chords thinly sprinkled drums and computer game bleeps reels you back into your own head after the all-out glee of the ep opener is the broody centrepiece hiding behind a minute of swells a sprinkling of that tell-tale minimal kimbie percussion patter and a whole ream of bass evolutions you find the sweetest piece released by the duo to date which winds talkbox vocals high around vibraphone chords and on through the pristine snap of a finger snap snare finishing the ep with kimbie again show another side letting the upfront drum line roll out immediately as they pick apart what sounds like the squealing dial-up modem sound thats been lost to the ages break rules not only do they eschew dubsteps 140 bpm template they like a lot of their immediate contemporaries refuse to lean on the midrange bassline or any kind of half-step drum pattern and they never ever stop experimenting while their work is becoming recognisably theirs their signature drum work and sultry synth chords are the true standout moments on both eps one must also credit them with something bigger by pouring the pounds of passion and eons of their studio time into forging the brave new directions displayed here theyve taken this new intrinsically woeful and yet delightfully iridescent strain of dubstep and forced it into the ears of a completely new audience
is a new cassette label based in amsterdam judging by the first release an eight track compilation of dark and heady cuts from the burgeoning techno noise industrial scene its one to keep tabs on artists contribute from all over europe some are established names like who recently dropped gnarly ebm eps on labels like candela rising and smashing tape is in the same vein other artists are more obscure their releases fewer in number or hard to find highlights include s horror themed and its terror synth stabs screams and choking sounds haunted industrial techno of by serbian artist is another has a gothic techno thing about him that makes his records similarly interesting and his ca ro is like a grinding blend of post rock and techno most striking (and monstrous) sound design comes from theres something beastly about the snarls behind the groggy trudge of static sound wall of s comes a close second
reads the press release for this ep is the new anonymous side project of two prominent uk garage producers remixers known for remixing a string of top 0 singles as well as having their own minor hit in the late naughties if this is true then one can only imagine the kind of trauma these producers must have endured to produce veto the four tracks on the duos self-released debut ep are blunt noisy and tremendously unpleasant on the ear making them a neat fit for uk technos recent turn towards the abrasive in fact in places theyre a little too blunt with its angry but impotent kick drum and tinny dub chords has more in common with the punkish stiffness of the cassette scene than the strictures of dance floor techno is similarly lacking in punch its stop-start broken beat pattern proving a tad monotonous over five minutes but in the best traditions of the form veto s finer moments harbour a subtle but compelling funk beneath their pummeling facade is a raucous pissing match of tortured noise-textures that spiral off into psychedelic squalls in the breakdown even better is a lumbering reinterpretation of early downwards-style loop-techno the whole thing is distorted into a single molten texture thats exquisitely painful if would like to give up their day job theyre welcome to
ever go to a bad club night and hear just one fine track amidst the generic sludge i did and it turns out after much soulseeking that it was s tanzmann s label moon harbour is one of those german imprints that is torn between deep house and minimal a dilemma which has sometimes paid excellent dividends - daniel stefanik s liquid on the label proved that deep house put together with minimal sound design can bring out the best in both genres as a producer tanzmann himself has often sided with tried and true house templates rather than the sound nerd world of minimal techno but gets the balance right taking one fantastically selected house stab and slowly modulating it over six minutes to glorious effect there s a breakdown here and a bit of mechanical plip-plop chucked in to let you know what year it is but this is all about the stab vs the cutoff filter three minutes in it develops exactly the right balance between groove and intricacy and there you go the club is rolling again b-side is virtuoso synth flourishes over a dubbier feel but it s too random to pack the same kind of punch is the track here and i must have become more of a deep house fan because it made my night

harry wright wants to make club culture more accessible he doesnt care for dj hierarchies nor does he fetishise gear that said he uses a ton of it in giant swan his raucous improv techno band with robin stewart wright takes a more primitive approach on witness his first solo record as i like the idea of using really basic common materials like garageband 09 hes said is therefore a very different beast to giant swan with a more obvious club focus witness might be a lurching uk bass ep in industrial disguise some of the drums lean towards tribal offering blasts of woody resonances in an otherwise grimly metallic sound world the programming is remorseless if a little flat the record hits a rattling juke-tinged peak on and drops into technoid head nod on all that dull hammering leaves you exhausted by the time you get to tom s s remix which doesnt deviate much from the format the record is well produced and the concept is admirable but compared to the unfettered and supremely volatile riot of giant swan witness is a little disappointing even so lets not write off the new project just yet
words unspoken acts undone is not a mellow record italian producers clockwork and avatism have openly professed their love for early warp bangers classic uk jungle and dub techno and all of those influences are present and readily apparent on the duos debut full-length s sound isnt all that far from what special request turns out these days although paul woolford is more willing to indulge in the wild unpredictability of uk hardcore pair gravitates toward brooding techno menace y may cringe every time someone brings up their history as one-time purveyors of high-gloss tech-house for hot creations and life and death but the overly polished precision and flatness of that style does seep into their work words unspoken acts undone occasionally tries too hard often sound like theyre emulating past inspirations instead of drawing from them result is an expertly assembled album that sounds fantastic even as it lacks a strong identity ir formula is solid but familiar no help then that its also been better innovated by the likes of millie andrea tessela akkord and lakker are at their best when they stray from standard techno templates and experiment with breakbeats and untraditional rhythms is a stirring piece of jungle-techno drama and conjunct empathy ups the ante with some hyperactive footwork-esque percussion drum workout of is wonderfully unrelenting and is a big bold dj tool in the guise of industrial-tinged hip-hop on a track-by-track basis there really isnt a bad one on words unspoken acts undone yet the lp bleeds together and drags in its second half if anything the music is too uniform which goes to explain why is such an obvious highlight with its crunchy rhythm the bouncey house cut isnt a total departure from the stark motif but the bloopy synth melody which greatly recalls simian mobile discos cerulean brings some much-needed levity to words on an album as rigid as this its something of an oasis and an indication that could do well to loosen up a bit
taken from a compilation by hisa ishiokas bpm records in 1991 is the latest reissue of rare and usually excellent japanese house records soichi terada who produced with manabu nagayama (and whose music was recently compiled on rush hour) has appeared on lots of these releases illustrating his prominence on the japanese scene some 20 years ago package arrives with a remastered original and two remixes that apply light decorous touches to the source material the foog remix of the longest of the three tracks foregrounds a pinging bassline against a drawn-out loop of the originals uplifting pads and cheery flutes also retains much of the originals structure but lays a beefier bassline underneath and a smattering of extras bongos vocal chops a flute melody messing around with an almost perfect deep house track is tricky but this is a slick and affectionate package
album is dying or so they say sales are down; customers are buying individual tracks from itunes; torrent feeds are reducing revenues and spotify seems set to change things again artists are suggesting a reinvention of the format with some suggesting that an ongoing blurt of ceaseless creative production is the way forward but if evidence for the continuing importance of the album were needed you need look no further than s debut long-player marco freivogel and ingo gansera have put together a diverse collection of tracks worthy of giving the format the time it deserves: 50 minutes spent with is time well spent but more importantly its necessary given the time and space play around test their boundaries and try things not possible in the club from the funk infused electro ambient spatial sounds of to the dark brittle techno of and develops in unpredictable ways s not primarily dance floor material not in a classic way lush saturated summer-inducing chords of are beautiful light and a world away from the heavy unstable foghorn building minimalness of dubby vocal-based grooves of meanwhile take things in an entirely different direction slowed down deep and soulful played in one sitting the movement from one period-referencing track to another is evident: duo go from dub rhythms to old-school stripped back techno into breakbeats without losing their trademark complexity and elemental sounds a few duds not withstanding ( sits ploddingly amongst the more refined tighter offerings on this album) the duos ear for tight loops repeating in a constantly varying fashion keep you interested engaged and surprised listening back to their ra podcast from january 2007 seeing them live then listening to this album you hear three different acts: live they drop it hard tight and its all about dancing whilst their earlier material (2006s flight cancelled for instance) is clickier bleepier altogether more minimal this album however crosses boundaries moves between sounds and uses the format to its full extent album is dead t quite

put his name on the map with the type of candy-sweet uptempo house that would soon sweep the uk the londoner has since been tip-toeing away from that formula and his first release in almost two years is his farthest afield yet whats most striking about opener is its lack of foundation as if the kick drum youd expect was removed at the last minute its skittish and fussy driven by stuttering snares and interrupted by blasts of thriller -esque synth geekd isnt any more substantial this time slamming synth stabs provide the contrast for the seedy backdrop while both tracks are almost torpid theyre more about anticipation than banging in any traditional sense gives us a gliding house beat its effortlessly lightweight as if held aloft by thermal updrafts but theres something anxious about the melody (were certainly not dealing with the pop-friendly confectionery of heartbreaker here ) burrowing even deeper takes the slippery excitement of jungle breaks and plunges them in minor key melancholia the track like in general has the same pop sensibility rhythmic dexterity and emotional wallop of s previous work its just dressed up in different clothes now
not lifting off not sitting still both the most serene and one of the most subtly unsettling things hes authored s natalias is the first new thing hes released under his own name since the one foot in front of the other mini-lp in ugust 2009 they just happened to be the two years when everything he set in motion from one foot s return to 8-bit formalism to the rave-throwback formalism of where were u in 92 to the blithering psychedelia of early singles like liquid dancehall and spliff dub (rustie remix) began to spin on its own axis spinning on its own axis works to describe natalias as well you dont typically associate this kind of dreamy pulse with and definitely not this sort of dawn-rising slow-and-even progression-not-build has he been listening to four tet and caribou too (maybe; he is signed to ) but he makes that soft-metallic-percussive melodic weave indubitably his by fraying the timbres a little (particularly on the echoey vocal-sample daubs) and cultivating a little dry ice along the drums rather than hebden or snaiths sunshine in the sense that a single is a piece of music that stands strongly on its own im not sure this is all that good a single; it sounds like it will ripen with an albums context but as a big left turn a whetting of the appetite for what the rest of s album will sound like natalias is pretty shrewd and that has merits of its own
s comes on from the start with lots of atmosphere: warm woolly synths space-making clavier diaphanous vocals it scans in every way as a reasonably agile take on deep house but its also absent a centralizing focus or force that would make it do anything but float away with little left to linger in the end the singing is too sweet for its own good and little in the track beneath it grounds the understandably evanescent falling-in-love sentiment in terms that translate to any other state (its a fools errand to call out lyrics in such a context but still: youre a joy to my eyes is there a more clinical or less romantic way to call someone pretty ) a dark remix gives some teeth and even a little snarl with demented dub effects on the vocals that play well with the rougher grain of the rhythm deetron takes on the track twice in an dub that seethes as much as it shakes and a that fares less well without the darker aspect another remix by (a duo including joe goddard from hot chip) proves the most antic of the lot and the most interesting for the ways it flirts with falling apart
limited is a young label run by the los angeles artists eprom hej fund and dean grenier they also have a collaborative production project whose first release together operates like a mission statement for both endeavors bleak techno is the theme (that darkly cryptic cover art is no coincidence) but the sound here is both thoughtful and well-rounded from the title tracks mystic brutalism to the grim paranoia of sets an exciting precedent for what this trio could accomplish together a hammering blown-out kick gets of started without hesitation continues to wreak fiery mayhem until a gelatinous pad oozes over the tunes jagged edges slowly consuming it whole the effect feels like a transformation in real time a six-eyed noise-techno beast becoming the ghost 90s idm on the other hand sticks to its drum machine athletics entirely a method that works well for the group amidst concrete kicks and razorwire hats juggles a few loopy synths and fx into the heavy groove its reassuring to know that range and unpredictability informs the work as much as hardcore austerity and big nasty drums

for a release covered in glaswegian fingerprints its surprising to see that comes from a colombian producer juan carlos torres alonso scottish producer and visual artist konx-om-pax designed the cover and upstart label was founded by clair crawford an experienced music promoter in glasgow but theres more to s debut that ties it to the city than circumstantial associations in places resembles hudson mohawkes mercurial approach to pop on lantern in particular tica s shimmering melodies and sugared vocal blocks recall deepspace a miguel-featuring track from hudmos album alonso has a tender baritone that holds up well against the busy synth squiggles and processed voices of on aalas he reaches across the song to create a sense of intimacy even as melodies swell and panning loops bustle around him sounds engineered for a wide audience but its curious sound design invites listeners to inch out of their comfort zones the excellent amilie-led for example coughs and rips pieces of paper underneath a radio-glossed lacquer and on the occasions when alonso strips it all away as he does on his songwriting is no weaker for it
first three entries in s archive showcased a melodic but tough brand of techno not wholly distinct from the work on his more well-known label modularz remains in the same territory bringing together five tracks with big low-ends and a sinister streak opener of is the most upfront of the lot with chord stabs taking centre stage while hi-hats crash in and out of the frame rest of the tracks are loosely speaking dj tools though each seems to have been crafted with a different time slot in mind and are geared for peak-time with the latters vocals standing as the releases most memorable moment atmospheric is probably the weakest effort while closing cut will best serve djs keen to add something hypnotic to their arsenal
i have been a great fan of s albums i must confess hearing the likes of derrick carter tony humphries and john digweed compile their favourite tracks that have made them the dj s that they are today is always inspiring and now the crew have added another superb choice to the mixer with now digging deep into his collection to deliver an array of classic productions from yesteryear having witnessed a after party compiling of danny smoothly putting records from the 60 s right through to the current era this mix was always going to be interesting the first disc begins with displaying some very smooth classics with the likes of carino 90 by t-coy unleashing some smooth piano lines and delicate drums the vocal stylings you re gonna miss me by turntable orchestra has a classic feel to it while two production by fire island show us how much these guys had an impact of hastings born howells tha wild pitch mix of give a little love is a superb inclusion flowing in its full 10 minute glory filled with some superb drums and funky riffs todd terry s mix of pm dawn sums up the superb funky vibe this first disc has while ce ce peniston s keep givin me your love is one of my personal highlights in a mix that looks set to end of in a stunning way there is a little tough acid like interlude first with oracion and then the magical trance remix of hocus pocus the bouncy basslines of painkiller by slack are purely addictive and the finale is a superb renaissance esque ambient mix of ready for dead a track that concludes an overall smooth mix that underlines a lot of danny s early set antics in the modern day the howells edit of space face by sub sub is a superb way to begin the next disc filled with smooth string patterns and funky riffs coldcut s brilliant timber is a stunning inclusion showing us what pioneers coldcut were in their time japan s ghosts is a interesting inclusion slowing the mix to standing pace with the quirky vocals and eerie sounds of the 70 s uk outfit own mix of the temptations papa was a rolling stone keeps the smooth flow going midway into the second disc the beats get rolling again with faze action s superb plans designs a track masterfully filled with some stunning string patterns and tribal like drum patterns there are two quickfire inclusions by livin joy s visnadi giving the mix a slightly tougher edge with some chunky house while orbital s classic impact makes just that taking the mix up a notch with some mind tripping sounds and effects mad monks on zinc is eerie yet undeniably brilliant with its quirky piano line and haunting pads and effects the black science orchestra provide a nice little interlude into the final production carly simon s 80 s classic smooth club anthem why much like this album is interesting in so many ways it has some great productions that are cutting edge timeless and enchanting while it has some more mainstream dare i say it cheesier moments that make the album so much more rewarding as it culminates so delightfully it is another superb edition to this vibrant series a series that by its nature shouldn t be as cutting edge as some more modern albums but still continually is with each edition
adrian sherwood formed the label in 1980 london was as influenced by collectivist ideals as it was by the loose scene emerging from the wreckage of punks first wave many of its flagship acts such as and were less bands than ad hoc alliances of musicians it was a broad church too welcoming traditional roots artists like post punk agitators like ari up from slits jazz musicians performance artists and in members of sugarhill gang who moved on from hip hop to industrial rock given that eclecticism there was always more to than the dub it became synonymous with on science fiction dancehall classics trevor jackson a long time on u obsessive who even nabbed the name from one of its acts puts a microscope over the labels punk funk and industrial side in doing so he reveals the source of the sound that would inspire much of the roster signed to his output label by the 80s the meeting of punk and reggae popularised by clash had transformed into something far weirder with scabrous bass and snarled vocals tracks like s allan s and s could have all been scooped from the same melting pot as public image ltds metal box (that bands bassist jah wobble appears here on s ) more traditional reggae styles come to the fore as on or s f it sounds like roots music shrouded in the smoke of belching chimneys rather than fragrant spliffs science fiction dancehall classics also demonstrates how the label went in other directions ts jay and s featuring a young show how sherwood was enamoured with the embryonic electro and hip hop scratch tracks emanating from america his remix of s turns the british jazz funk group into what feels like a giorgio moroder disco tune stomping around in boots made of pure bass the centre of everything is sherwood himself turning up the low end ladling on reverb dropping in bicycle bells and birdsong on in cases like by he strangles the outlandish sounds from his mixing desk until you have no idea what they are its not so cutting edge now but must have all sounded incredibly futuristic at the time some of the electro stuff in particular hasnt dated well even if their rudimentary beats still have a certain rough edged charm science fiction dancehall classics is a treasure trove for newcomers as well as on u completists (theres a generous number of previously unreleased tracks) and a fascinating piece of dance music genealogy s pt 2 featuring could be a template for the trip hop of her later work with massive tack s prefigured bomb squads aggressive sample collages for public enemy s prefigures contemporary bass musics experimental fringes with reggae punk industrial hip hop and early electronica all colliding science fiction dancehall classics is a soundclash from which the shockwaves can still be felt over 30 years later
its a good backstory: obscure japanese producer releases one -inch on chain reaction back in 00 never to be heard from again until the two crate-diggers of demdike stare somehow get to him the 0 release of butterfly effect via demdike stares label and the subsequent reissue of that excellent first -inch ship-scope won a small but devoted new following for his understated sound which is reprised on the mini-album where butterfly effect also saw atobe explore more experimental electronics s six tracks are contained to his loop-based rhythm compositions good news for anyone into the kind ambient caress found in opening track even better if youre a fan of narcotic house and subliminal techno as a minimalist atobe practices a deceptively simple melodicism neatly looped every track except the almost purely percussive displays some evidence of this but his main strength is in his sense of rhythm and the way the rhythmic layers interact in elegant elliptical orbit atobe also has an excellent ear for timbre and effects from the gentle fizz that suffuses most of the tracks (but is different on each) to the dreaminess of his synth choices in and to the crispness of the latters hi-hats isnt as varied or adventurous as butterfly effect but it still reaches the high level of quality weve come to expect from a producer we know very little else about but both albums are mined from atobes archive meaning that theres no telling at what point in the last 0 years any particular track dates from perhaps thats a reason that much of his work feels so timeless
s first solo album my skeleton was a graceful sweep of orchestral strings pianos and swelling walls of sound is very much a continuation of my skeleton s moods and atmospheres and like its full-length counterpart works best when treated as one continuous piece the eps first half is made up of muscular yet blissful soundscapes kicks off in fourth gear with a cacophonous multi-layered field of distortion a barely discernible melody and bass that wouldnt sound out of place on a sunn o))) record a surprise comes near the end when it all dissipates into a faraway pop song as speeeds yearning voice and a simple guitar melody pierce through the noise dr is almost as dense but a little gentler with an undulating haze of pads chimes and bass the short field recordings-based ushers in a second half that finds speeed adding more textures to his crashing walls of sound takes chaotic high notes and freeform drum claps into its gale of pads while sorry is slow but epic a shifting cast of orchestral swells and sparse bass melodies eventually gives way to a twinkle of harp notes shows theres still plenty of mileage in s current template
two very solid producers in mike hiritzka justin scott dixon (aka voyager) team up for the next release on with it s a welcome return for justin who has impressed in the past with some stunning records in his time on the a-side is the original mix from the two producers and it starts off very impressively with a smooth chunky baseline meeting some swirling effects and solid drums the track is quite impressive at this point with acid influenced stabs taking control and the track flowing very nicely but for me the track goes downhill from the midway point where the synths start making their entrance for me it turns into a dated trance production overdone and largely uninspiring and very disappointing considering the quality of the first half of the production the descent mix on the flip tries to put some sense to it all and they do a pretty nice job but nothing outstanding the track does flow nicely with some crisp drum patterns and nice subtle dark synths midway in leading into the main breakdown the synths from the original unfortunately see an introduction later on in the track but it only slightly tarnishes a pretty nice mix from descent well i was certainly disappointed with this release as it seems these producers stepped back a few years with this release and not in a progressive way there are some good moments in there for sure but they don t take away from the disappointing ones
you know what youre getting with a highgrade release the label makes quality tech-house that uses off-beat electronics very originally its also some of the funkiest music around labels like this or morris udio and its offshoots are for me the unsung heroes of the dancefloor they make sophisticated beat tools that can usually be relied upon to inject a bit of life into a flagging dancefloor the title cut chugs along at a typical tech-groove level and does everything youd want of a track of its ilk the low-end percussion forms a solid foundation upon which sporadic synth lines break free to keep thing interesting does much the same thing but in a slightly more menacing fashion while takes things back down a notch the latter is the most pedestrian of these three tracks but it enlivens things with a subtle cutting analogue spurt that emerges from out of the gloom just when it is needed there really isnt that much to wax poetic about here but i can safely say that highgrade is one of my favourite labels it rarely disappoints and this release is another textbook example of highgrades raw funky electronic aesthetic s such its difficult to imagine spinning without tracks like these
andy wilsons latest ep lands on the right side of goofy just its terrain the australian producer who released a hotly tipped album under the name house of dad last year has been trekking for the past few years reflected in track titles like always pumping and magpie echoes christens wilsons new label with three catchy house tunes that could be demo tracks for the microkorg synth each draws from familiar sounds combining classic detroit pads 90s techno stabs and proto-deep house chords into a package with humour or is it sarcasm at its heart despite being four minutes long takes up the full a-side it builds from a simple kick to a bubbling house jam with a rudimentary progression that sees each element a melodic bassline an open hi-hat a pad added one by one until an abrupt ending thanks to an evolving two-note rave stab is more sprightly while lays down 90s-style chords and pads over an uptempo glide an unconventional structure and a laymans feel means you shouldnt expect to hear in many dj sets but dont let that stop you from trying to place it in yours

australian duo alex murray and mark smith make improvisatory techno but theyre not a band in the sense of say elektro guzzi who play with live drums and guitars on much of their debut album seem to be feeling their way through a dark passage their apathy towards structure makes them a perfect fit for nyc dance-not-dance label rvng tl home to blondes and other sound explorers and while the idea of two dudes fooling around with some hardware to make raw improvised dance tracks might be more-than-common in have a toughness that puts them in their own sphere thing needs to be made very clear: s jamming might qualify as rough but its anything but lo-fi fact part of s appeal comes from its variety of textures and how prominently theyre presented one of the albums most lopsided grooves is full of leads that splatter like theyre being fed through a meat grinder these textures stand out because is so resolutely monochrome theres not even a hint of colour lurking at the edges be it in the eerie melodies of or the dubby techno of this might be on purpose or it might be circumstance the group lost a good deal of their gear (and the songs stored on them) halfway through the albums recording forcing them to start from scratch as a result theres a factory-fresh feel to much of as if they tore the plastic off their new toys and immediately got down to business and while we cant say exactly which songs are from when its fun to imagine that the slow rising action of the title track is the direct result of the two figuring out how to harness their new equipment turning a roughshod tom-tom beat into a broken techno monster filled in with creaks and whines the swampy thrum of meanwhile proves that they can get down and dirty and conversely feels like the work of artists who know exactly how to force unhealthy sounds out of their studio with its stoic disposition dystopian atmosphere and of course emphasis on hardware (apparently no computers were used in the production process) there are a lot of things about that are very of the moment but it wouldnt be fair to call them trendy when you scratch past the surface its a pretty singular lp even if the aesthetics are familiar they might be skeletal and drained of colour but their tracks have an unpredictable wandering spirit that makes them far more than listless jamming
the little brother of yoshitoshi have a string of releases coming out shortly that are just superb bernard leon howard iii is leading the charge for the label with this extremely hot doublepack marscarter is being featured on some of the hottest compilations of late including satoshi tommeiis gu:nubreed chris fortiers bedrock 3 and john creamers and stephane ks bedrock 4 the original rolls along at a nice and steady pace with vocals taking lead for the majority of this mix light rolling synths and metallic type basslines are mixed around with a light slapping of a bass guitar morels pink noise mix stays close to the original but tones down the ingredients and adds a little more funk joshuas dub 1 is a great track from this collection with a chunky beat and constant guitar and bass guitar riffs the synth turns more into an organ and makes this mix fly debo and porters deported vocal goes deep the air is filled with haunting basslines and the filtering of the vocal works very well tweaks and turns add to this atmospheric mix i can see why this release has grabbed so much interest with a variety of tracks reaching across many genres and outstanding production

recently converted fans of the color series will be pleased to find operating in similar areas on like the best of that collection on this track he finds a set of chords he likes and stays with them the chords run constantly under a selection of sounds that recall classic detroit yet everything is arranged in such a way as to be more than amenable to current dancefloors each side of the 12-inch contains a different mix but in both it is the scintillating percussion that keeps things moving in the first the drugged out synth sweep is introduced early on as formations of hi-hats are shoved up and down scales and then dragged through it all backwards it s a prime-time killer on the -side the same elements are stretched out allowing more time before the percussion is twisted in and the synth seems even hazier so while i can assure you that this release is more than suited to the dancefloor words really fail me to describe just how lovely the chords are usually i feel cheated when a 12-inch is two sides of the same thing but i really wouldnt have it any other way here
is next up on the very loveable imprint with two very warm and smooth productions to further enhance the reputation of quality diverse music of the label first up is rosaline in love and it begins very smoothly with some crisp drums as well as an enticing melodic pattern the track then out of nowhere becomes a little gritty and electro as nice electro stabs come into the track and really lift it up a notch alongside vocal samples that build in the background as well as a fantastic array of sounds and samples in the background this track comes together very well and is very fun great stuff labyrynth on the flip is a fair bit chunkier with some tough drums and a gritty guitar riff that makes this the tough production that it is there are some unique and quirky vocal samples late on in the track giving it a bit of a trailer trash feel that is quite dirty a very interesting release and a release that sums up what this label is all about expect the unexpected
nan kol is best known as the digital digger who found gqom via an internet wormhole and founded a label oh devoted to its dissemination as a producer he has collaborated on a track with wallwork on a ep but is his solo debut it features two originals with remixes from citizen and formation z its no surprise gqom is s biggest influence and as might be expected with an ep from a new artist the remixes are the strongest tracks they both capture the single-minded mantric energy weve come to expect from gqom on his remix of the title track citizen lays hypno-bass drones high in the mix while formation z use every element as percussion apparently the zulu word for uncle an affectionate nickname kol earned in durban starts with a gqom formula of militaristic drums and samples that echo with dark resonance but instead of allowing funk to emerge the italian producer builds up the layers which are both intriguing and arbitrary in their juxtapositions feels less specific to gqom but it still aims for south african house bouncier and more cohesive kol does a better job of keeping it from wandering away
with the glut of by-the-numbers minimal house threatening to flood most of europe the last thing we need is more of it so all the more puzzling that chloe and sascha funke felt the need to rework one anothers discarded chaff the rules were thus: each of them chose an unfinished track from their not done yet folder for the other to complete without altering what was already there the results are disappointingly less than the sum of parts point final is a spacious and dry exercise sounding like cologne of five years ago functional kick bass and rattling hats do the rounds before a clap is introduced prematurely then some maracas and a sludgy synth riff theres a break which reaches for ravey stars before returning to earth for the home stretch hand in hand is the stronger work and seems promising as a two tone synth cell shudders among lesser low end gurgling and a minor barrage of short tone bursts a break involving choral drones and chunky stabs hints at greatness but again were let down returning to the opening patterns reiterated these producers are capable of better funke being a personal favourite but due to lacklustre opening material both tracks fail to ignite
its hard to make electro tunes that dont sound beholden to the 80s and berlin newcomer seems well aware of this his debut for hypertext doesnt fight the vintage aesthetic opting instead for a rugged detroit-centric style that embraces electro tropes so tightly they become an integral part of his music he avoids sounding derivative thanks to a clear command of the machines and ideas he uses even when s angular beats are noisy and overdriven like on and he maintains a grasp of mood and melody with spectral pads and slight touches of reverb those elements are crucial to giving such familiar sounds an indelible mark as is the way his drum sequences move loosely and seemingly independently of each other trance takes a more rigid approach to 909 patterns and tries on raved-up stabs before settling back into stomping ebm slows things down on working out a laidback groove that evokes a cruise through a city at night its an image as classic as the music it brings to mind and yet one that hypertext uniquely renders with its own colors and shades
theres a weird theological gravitas to the ringing hook of this eps title track when vocalist valentina belts out the word gabrieeeeel at various points throughout you cant help but feel her despair so strong is the vocal in fact that the whole track verges on all-out anthem but cultured lyrics ( for he was stronger than was but its strength you cant sustain / do not come to give me counsel you should beg forgiveness ) and mature well-defined drums mean the thing stands up to repeat listening goddards most evolved solo work to date could well be sorry to be lazy but the other two tracks are rather more hot chip-esque has waify piano lines wimpy male vocals and lingering organ chords all meandering around each other to form a sombre downbeat bouncer the thing unfurls over nine lazy minutes where crunks from the off theres a heavy-footed elephantine pomp to the bottom end which cant help but bring a smile to your face as glassy keys and fizzy synths squirm above

a note in the press materials for s latest acid exploration describes its four tracks as bangers jugular acid trax that dont mess around and its right on the money the classicworks co-founder gives his hard-edged drums and percolating 303 sequences next to no room to shift flip or change each track features a single acid line at its core with little more than melodic texture and obscured samples filling out the mix its not the best conceit for the more straightforward stuff: save for some punchy snares and sharp hi-hats a-sides and are all too content to ride the flat trajectory of relentless 4/4s and anxious atmospherics it takes some unexpected drum work and slippery grooves to make more of s spartan aesthetic things get interesting on the b-side with s slip-and-slide 303 and the rhythmic sleight of hand in those tracks arent bangers simply by playing hard and fast adds some brains to their brawn and his clever pattern shifts make the intensity that much more engaging with quick and incisive mixing djs could wring dance floor fire from portions of s heavy drums maybe even the frantic hard-smacking claps in but for banging acid whose bite lives up to its bark stick to the flipside of
real name lexander erg is a master of functional deep house that might sound like faint praise but it isnt erg is one half of genius of time a dj and production duo who have put out some of the best party anthems of the past two years namely houston we have problem and their even better (if less overplayed) rework of love thang by first choice working solo erg takes a subtler tack crafting wintry cuts of seductive deep house is the first release on a new label called and it shows erg doing what he does best but with a murkier aesthetic than usual the title track is fat and smudged with a groaning bassline foggy chords and a slightly seasick swaying motion which is made up entirely of drum sounds is an exercise in groove assembly thats always been ergs strong suit and here he pushes the envelope piling staccato rhythms on top of each other until the track is almost too busy then breaking into a cleaner gait oth make the artist and the label one to watch

having previously appeared only on net labels london-based greg now releases two -inches on the same day and on the same label where heart has brittle rhythms drenched in saccharine melodies is all sombre atmospherics and african percussion quite a difference then but on this evidence is a producer who can turn his hand to a range of styles and on his skill with details percussion in particular matches up against artists with much larger discographies the variations are the more subtle tracks the drum programming is painstakingly detailed and visual: some hits boom with sub-bass others whisper in the distance and all carefully inhabit their place in the 3-d soundstage and are more dance floor-oriented the first is driven by a massive 4/4 kick drum and charging congas it pushes itself forward with lifts drops and a smart switch-up of the conga pattern near the end is less intense its dank bass music somewhere along the lines of livity sound an eerie lead sounding something like a toad being passed through a granulator contributes to the feel of early evening apprehension lakker having graced the first of love loves vinyl releases provide a remix of they pile on the nervous tension through an odd drum pattern and a whole heap of aggressive static theres a stronger handling of club dynamics than in s version but the original doesnt fall short by much making it all the more impressive that its only his first physical release

in the murky world of dub techno or more specifically dubby tech house few producers have made as much of an impact as brendon moeller since 2005 under his own name and as both beat pharmacy and echologist the nyc-dwelling saffer has amassed a scary amount of work most of it very decent area on the other hand is a relative newcomer (at least as a non-remixer) although if his jam-packed release schedule is anything to go by that tag should soon disappear together they form who alongside the mercurial moeller-affiliated shetland rank among s coolest (/only) dub techno super-groups anyway what theyve come up with here is perfectly enjoyable if not exactly the kind of thing non-dub techno heads will get a kick out of particularly in the case of the b-side which is about as submerged a piece youre ever likely to hear its basically the a-side re-imagined by a stoned hippo (glazed kicks plodding bass wafty chords) which is more or less a good thing but not as good a thing as the a-side not re-imagined by a stoned hippo which sounds like the scuzziest piece of low-riding filter-abusing dub house-meets-minimal either man has put their name to again its by no means suitable for the unconverted but if youre the kind of person who fantasises about deadbeat and savas pascalidis getting down and dirty in the studio (or such like) youll love it
promise no garish melodies in their press materials for which leaves me a little cold returning to house while leaving the garish melodies behind feels like the proverbial having of cake and eating it for the minimalistas if youll pardon the clich part of what motivates great house is the careful weighting of supple groove and melodic rapture berlin producer s new single is a nice metaphor for what minimal and/or electronica producers often do with/to deep house (at least from luomos vocalcity on): strip the track to its core and turn the female diva into either a fleeting memory or a compulsive desiring-machine of tics and gasps but with also goes fairly light on the vocal science dicing female vocals into repetitive stammers interjections that function texturally and as punctuation its nice as a tease but you keep waiting for a syntactical revelation that never comes is all about tease actually or at the very least about being sparing with the details its propelled by a keenly insistent rhythm where tambourines and hi-hats keep the treble dancing over an insistent shuddering arpeggio everythings precise and clear almost workmanlike which is part of the pleasure though could have drawn more emotional colouration from the diva samples hes used how you respond will depend on exactly what youre after: whether you feel those garish melodies are what make house or youre simply happy that theyre not there to distract you from the essentials the latters always felt like a cheap shot thoughhhouse deserves your love because it offers you all you need the song in interface with the track s plenty seductive and its physical compulsion is its real charm but imagine what could have done with those divas
the latest from white label series s is the curious case of the grime track that wasnt its a hybrid tune that makes no bones about being hybrid: theres a specific lack of the sonic elements that would mark it as current neither backwards-looking dogma nor big ticket futurisms is nothing but the essentials: punctuated staccato rims and hats straight pummeling kicks and a touch of bright synths repeated bar after bar after bar nyone with the least bit of exposure to london radio pirate or otherwise will recognize the phrasing immediately (and the second cut a heat-seaking vocal remix featuring veteran mc should make those connections especially clear) netheless its just as much a drum workout as it is a gun-finger track its all economy of means scrubbed of context and refreshingly so or in the words of the remix hooks s

almost three years after the release of his debut ep leeds producer is still too young to legally enter the clubs he plays without an adult guardian but his sound continues to evolve beyond his years in ras fastforward film about him the then-16-year-old summed up his musical credo saying dance music works really well if it has a lot of energy and i find that if you use aggression to provide the energy then thats what i love thats still very much the case on the first release on he and dan foats new pt/5 imprint however theres also a slight refinement and increased melodic attention amid the brutality suggesting cloaks his tracks in less murk as he sharpens their ideas standouts and are different takes on the same dark pounding house idea both send loads of percussive energy into grainy soundscapes of howling chords and layered low-end is stormy and vivid while hits on a moody slow-build the bass groove and descending key patterns of ascension are perhaps too clean and linear and the track isnt helped by the tacky call-to-arms vocal regardless s sound is progressing nicely and will go down as another largely impressive staging post
max graef and glenn astro seem like a natural fit on their few productions together as well as their label ex records their individual styles have instinctively mirrored and complemented each other this is at least partially due to a shared diggers mentality: graef and astros solo tracks pull sounds from jazz hip-hop funk disco and soul ir work swings loose and fast between those vintage influences often covered in the warm crackle youd expect from artists who have spent countless hours with their heads down in record bins following last years collaborative ex 01 ep is graef and astros first full-length together its said to be a dance record without the obvious components but no discernible concept or direction is established instead the pair simply find nine stoney spots in the house spectrum where their talents mesh together often a sign of a successful collaboration its hard to tell who exactly is responsible for what on each track hip-hop is usually a staple of each artists solo material but theres none of that here re is though plenty of head-nodding material galactic-funk excursion of ex me the title track (which evokes madlib jazzy project yesterdays new quintet) and the sublimely spacious viktors venture furthest into funky electronic jazz when graef and astro move to the dance floor the results are hardly straightforward uses thick drums and a walking bassline to anchor its endless cycle of swirling chords and electronic gurgles bristles on the edge of mutant house albums percussive lead single is a blunted rhodes jam session complete with frantic live drums turntable scratches and a barrage of squelching synth covers an impressive range but any conceptual throughline is muddled by its hazy meandering which isnt a surprise duos skill with playing outside the confines of functional club music is among their strongest attributes and sure enough erratic arrangements slippery musicianship and a playful spirit are the albums focus even if graef and astro dont seem to be headed anywhere in particular its still fun to hitch a hot-boxed ride with them

when blueprint announced that their 20th anniversary series would start with it seemed like a logical idea anthony childs best-known alias embodies blueprints core techno sound while offering a different perspective a bit of old with the new outside of a collaborative 12-inch back in 97 hes also never had a full release with the label following two albums that saw child exploring his newfound modular obsession in different ways finds him back on the dance floor this ep is the sound of an expert techno artist returning to what he knows best the grotty textures of from farthest known objects are here but theyre sucked into the groove like a raft in river rapids on child carefully builds a driving anthem based on classic elements throbbing leads brassy synths choppy drums and lets them get nice and grimy he goes filthier on where roughed-up leads hint towards a climax that never comes instead child loops back on the central motif making his lines thicker with each go-round is a reminder that though child is associated with a brutal and barreling strain of dance music his work is still complex might be a techno tantrum twisting itself into pretzels but its also remarkably liquid a wave of sound that washes over you instead of landing with a thwack and the eps most straightforward track on the surface has a world of spatial detail beneath the way his sounds swirl around the stereo spectrum is fantastic like its title hints feels introspective with child looking inward and finding the most quintessential record hes released in a while
juan ricos name doesnt get bandied around half as much as it should for a guy who has been djing and producing for a decade as well as running several labels but given the run of form hes had of late he might be about to be paid his dues as well as his excellent peacetime 12-inch for semantica last year under his architectural moniker rico has been busy on his own label the fruits of which are on this exceptional four track ep the bookends of the release are two more conventional techno tracks the opener passage 17 1 is tough and glacial in keeping with the sound of luke slater s mote-evolver imprint whereas the closer plays off its viscous bass injections and kick drum for a heavier low-to-the-ground sound but the real meat is in the middle passage 17 2 is ripe with menace and atmospheric repetition caught somewhere between regis and shifted whereas the rollicking feel of passage 17 3 is almost trance at first ricos dubbier tendencies build to a slow and steady climax with the accompaniment of whiplash sounds like an industrial techno equivalent of venus in furs
the last time graced the imprint with his production delights i was delighted with the results so it pleases me to no end that the man is back on the label with two more stunning productions that only he can deliver in this style first up is 3 steps left and the track begins with some very nice crisp tribal drum patterns once the baseline kicks in you know that we are in for a treat as it really gives the production a solid boost and great groove the track works quite well throughout with the introduction of solid effects and smooth synth patterns that all unite in true style on the flip is rock hopper a production that is noticeably smoother then the pretty intense a-side smooth beats accompany some vocal lines as well as a smooth vocal hook and deep subtle baselines cheek acid riffs come into the track late on as do quirky vocal wails making this quite a unique production another very solid outing by terry and it is clear to see why the imprint keeps coming back to his skills
m not one for reductive and unfair comparisons but listening to debut album by dutch drum bass prodigy cant help but be reminded photeks solaris at every turn maybe its overtures towards tempos beyond 70 maybe its sleek and shiny outfit borrowed from techno or fact that it starts f with distinctive strains legendary vocalist wafting through metal scaffolding s jeroen snik trying to pull a photek here was apparently an effort by snik to dig below surface his sound and focus on material not purely for dance floor and it shows in se tightly structured breezy songs llustrating ever dissolving gap between drum bass and dubstep snik delivers on promise xylophobia his convincing 40 bpm debut from last year for albums most inviting tracks vocals haunt swirling percussion on colours its swing with catchy synth noodling and stunning dives from airy pockets vocal-driven e reality into caustic pits lfo s dubstep is marked by a prioritization percussion ra r than bass so even on songs like power comes wholly from snapping drums instead wobbling midrange but for now anyway is largely a drum bass producer and is a drum bass label and sniks 70 bm tracks are rightfully main feature nstead making allegiances to current trends on ei r side underground spectrum boeing 747 roar modern neur unk like noisia and spor or hushed whispers autonomic builds on antiseptic textures his past work while bringing that techno influence to fore with reflective pads and lens flare glare shooting f everything s production values are top notch futurist without being cheesy: he turns orientalist strings into a rigid gallop on and makes a perfect approximation a gundam wing-style post-human world in impossibly lustrous dreadnaught nder the ce s most intriguing minutes are its final fifteen as depressive midtempo synth weeper fades into ten minutes silence followed by something that could almost be called prog the untitled hidden track (yes were still doing this unfortunate gimmick apparently) goes so hard it makes ben klock sound like anton zap almost garish in its ferocity and weighed down with all low-frequency reverence s more closely-connected communities ts both a little indulgent and highly impressive snik openly acknowledging music that apparently brings him most inspiration and doing so in a way surprisingly unique and unflinchingly honest ts a strange ending to an album that o rwise feels sealed shut but it signals opening a significant new door for a promising producer to move beyond restraints a niche genre who knows what else hell find re under ice
when clone announced that six specialist imprints were going to replace the mothership operation it had just called time on there was a palatable sense of relief that the dutch operator was back for more however the most impressive part of the plan that each label would represent a distinct style or sound could well be its downfall will people support labels that offered carbon copies of classic new york or chicago house (in the case of the drexciya-inspired aqualung imprint the argument is so far irrelevant because heinrich mueller formerly one half of the detroit group has provided the first two releases) or will these specialist operations become as popular as the classics offshoot the debut release on jack for daze clones sub-label dedicated to chicago house doesnt deviate from that particular script penned by uk house veteran last seen in action for rush hour offshoot hour is your rush its adherence to the timeless sound probably wont appeal to those in search of innovation is that such a bad thing though the title track leads on an eerie heard-style synth underpinned by a prowling rumbling bass watsons arrangement is laid back and the tempo unhurried with the unmistakable doubled up claps only appearing mid-way through similarly remains at the deep end of the spectrum based on a warm yet melancholic synth riff and a snippet of a vocal sample looped over a resonating bassline the remix of by gerd and label boss serge ups the ante and makes a nod to modern production techniques; the beats are harder the bass more distorted and the percussion harsher its a concession of sorts to current tastes and a tacit admission that the sound watson has so skilfully copied will live on for years and not daze

s early work was some of the brightest in the glorious explosion of uk dubstep circa 2007 funny that considering his home base isnt london but philadelphia one of the uss most visible adopters of dubstep pre-skrillex since the days of ephemeral exhibits p j eissinger has presented a happy medium between the american dance underground and the uk since moving from planet mu to that us-uk bridge has become literal as his music begins to absorb more influence from his homeland and as edm loud obnoxious no-holds-barred has taken hold of his home country so it has eissingers music intentionally or not third album meshes past orchestral tendencies with the rabble-rousing of s american dance music landscape coming out every bit as conflicted as that sounds continues full-bore with the science fiction themes that have always been a part of s music an epic and pristine intro bends over into hip-hop histrionics all slamming subs and glittering arpeggios; its at his most punishing but also most dazzling but then follows with a nails-on-chalkboard synth lead blatantly off-key with the rest of the chest-beating track eissinger sounds like hes madly scribbling all over a finished canvas indiscriminately trying to make it louder more violent plaintive tracks are repeatedly interrupted by undulating melodies borrowed from moombahton: take the two-part suite which hums gently with his own contemplative vocals before falling into a seizure of haywire synths and bludgeoning midrange but for those scared away by the thrash of his recent music also reinforces his keen sense of melody and sharpening sound design is prime icy blasts of synth shooting up like geysers between heavy pistons and soulful 8-bit squiggles on the other hand successfully manages to insert trap breakdowns into its pomp and circumstance as sputtering orchestral hits battle the wheeling hi-hats albums gorgeous one-two-punch ending sequence of and distance finally captures the sense of star-gazing that essingers music has always clumsily hinted at here he proves that dubstep can sound larger-than-life without resorting to masturbatory machismo however nice those moments might be feels split down the middle between exercises in blunt aggression and more nuanced takes on his space opera style most of the time eissinger tramples over his own handiwork in an attempt to make his tracks more danceable or more banging his last album ear drums black holes suffered from the same sort of split-personality and while is a tighter record its joints are still too weak to hold it all up
back in 2007 released two collections from his very first forays into musical production and performance entitled 1995-97 - the uracle sessions vol 1 and vol 2 they comprised 20-odd tracks of deeply atmospheric music that ranged from twisted acid house to downtempo and broken-beat boards of canada-esque electronica while oskans methods structures and subject matter may have developed through the years its clear from that his fondness for deeply evocative dreamlike soundscapes hasnt wavered those aforementioned structures are in s case largely techno given oskans repute as a live performer its actually a little surprising how clubby the album on the whole feels you could well imagine that this debut would be the perfect setting to indulge in long beatless meandering pieces instead oskan draws out long phrases and loops within otherwise quite uniform 4/4 moulds in most cases this is done with such an acute attention to detail that the relative barrenness of the tracks in question act as a celebration of single-mindedness forgoing all unnecessary distractions in favour of a single unifying point of clarity take for example fter the shimmering ambience of and the spectral groans of from a have gently eased you into the album the guttural low end of thumps hard at first feeling like an uninvited drunken guest banging at the door of your sophisticated dinner party but once oskan has drawn all the suspense possible out of a few hesitant chords during the elongated break and the cacophonous bass returns it feels good right and entirely welcome similar in structure but far darker in tone call embarks on its seven-and-a-half minute journey with little more to show for itself than a rigidly menacing hostile bassline its edgy but not oppressively so the tension again broken by a drawn-out break in the clouds towards the end of the album oskan delves deeper into melody both and are hauntingly beautiful analogue pieces with the latters gently trembling undulations pulling especially urgently on the heartstrings despite the obvious care and attention with which the rest of the album has been crafted these two closers cant help but make me wish for five or six more in a similar vein the result of which would surely have been a truly stunning album rather than just one that is undeniably excellent
pig dan surely need no introduction right no ok well dan duncan igor tchkotoua (pig) who form the duo have been producing music at first independently and now together since the late 80s theyve been known to write 2-3 tracks per week which lead to the formation of their labels submission and its sub(sic) labels tecmission and outmission this time round however we see them on sven vaths cocoon label for its 18th release usually i wait to the end of the review to pass judgement but this time ill start like this: is a killer little number - an intelligent teched-up cool stomper of a house track which would sit very nicely in the middle of a peak-time set progression wise in the first couple of minutes it goes through some cleverly varied and textured synth work sitting on top of a deep hypnotic bell-like bass and groovy beats losing the kick but keeping a lot of percussive energy the breakdown sees yellos most famous release nostalgically sampled once again as the track twists itself into something closer to techno for the main part we hear the vocal again the original bass is replaced with a higher new arpeggiated line and intensified rhythmic elements come in: some percussive some synthetic and some metallic effortlessly segueing to the outro (again no pause for breath here) were back to the initial groovy elements with a touch more percussion which keeps the energy up nicely despite not being the title track for this release the b-side micro kitchen is probably the main reason people will be picking this one up starting with rhythmic style similar to james holdens remix of andre kraml safari pig and dan soon lose the resemblance and gradually build the electro-influenced synths until the short breakdown hits and at least half of hell breaks loose a deep flanged bass slowly reveals itself as the snare keeps pace and an acid line starts to peak only to go into a heavily panned and increasingly reverbed fit a new electro lead then starts ticking all the boxes in your head that say yes its time to go crazy now add the kick etc as the breakdown ends and youve got a party complete with interesting outro (a short break with kick a deeper bouncier bass riff and some acid variations) and my only complaint is that i havent heard it in a club yet so two solid dancefloor numbers aimed at the busier hours of the night of great quality and using some very current elements in dance music without bandwagon-jumping or overdoing it a lot of labels are putting out 12 inches with two (or more) original tracks these days rather than a remix on the b but its rare to find an artist that can deliver two good singles at the same time
more often than not shared eps lack cohesion although that doesnt apply to this latest outing on ren s the eps unity of purpose is aided by a theme the slow of the title which results in four deep house tracks that keep things relatively laidback opens with an ode to the manchester district he currently calls home is velvety house with a touch of broken beat with its pulses angular rhythm and lush synths its the sort of thing you could imagine appearing on mantis recordings a decade ago more traditional deep house tropes follow with label head ren s trippy but its no less accomplished s compatriot turns in the moodiest of the four tracks embellishing zz ww with howling analogue synths indistinct vocals and sporadic live toms and snares ukrainian house producer s is a gem somewhat reminiscent of robag wruhmes quirkiness its packed with interesting ambient bleeps and sounds like its recorded at the bottom of a swimming pool
t first glance the romantic (and often eccentric) stylings of p p radock feel at odds with cid test recondite and tin mans releases on the label veered towards the somber and nocturnal but starts with a house shuffle so peppy it sounds spring-loaded from those introductory bars were shuttled at breakneck speed through the weird world of radock where up is down and house music means abstract sound collage with chords straight out of early phex ambient techno the track is uplifting in a very p p way the acid line pushes the track forward riffing on a phrase but rarely letting the squelch dominate in both tracks the acid synths arent the defining element not quite an afterthought but an undercurrent is all stormy skies to its counterparts sunny vistas one minute its lo-fi house the next minute hes shoving filter disco into the fray and in the last section its stomach-churning techno all while he tries to make the 303 sound as atonal as possible frankly its a mess a fate that the more charming somehow manages to avoid
the ever consistent soul tan return to the scene with another storming vocal track utilising the vocal talents of stephanie vezna the track many will be happy to hear also comes with a remix from the prog fans fave steve porter first up though is the original mix the flow for me is quite good throughout but i must say the vocals are not overly impressive they are a little disjointed throughout except for say the breakdown where they work quite well alongside the melodic touches from this point on though the track really takes off with the solid baselines and it finishes off in style from here on for me steve porter does a pretty good job livening the track up a fair bit especially from the opening minutes of his remix atmospheric synths surround the vocals alongside subtle percussive claps to be honest steve improves the track on so many fronts such as the percussive elements and especially the use of the vocals and melodic patterns and perhaps most importantly the flow and arrangement of the track as a whole a pretty solid release here for screen recordings but despite the solid efforts from steve porter and soul tan i must say that i have heard better from both these producers
what with all the recent attention given to flying lotus you could be forgiven for passing over s which whilst not quite as avant-garde as the warp hipster shows he has considerable promise as a beatsmith title track is a lazy mellifluous downbeat hip-hop cut that wouldnt be out of place on the next aim album clipped string samples lazy guitar chords and fat head-nodding beats combine to make the opening delightfully filmic but its not all lushness with and halfway through it breaks down into one of those guitar riffs thats so funky it makes your body spasm in a james brown kinda way well it does mine anyway my s remix gives the track a completely new spin whilst just about being recognisable as the original he takes a four-bar melody exerpt rearranges the notes so it sounds like the theme from get carter and slows it down so the beats are even chunkier and clunking res also some gibberish samples about experiments with humans which is a bit coldcut but works very well also on the ep is the mix by mexican of which adds afro percussion and a choir of vocals to reasonable effect joey tits effort turns it into a generic electro house number complete with justice-lite cut-up effects
there was a time when thought that no matter what was placed in front of me could deal with the situation was invincible and nothing could touch me but nothing can prepare you for the death of someone you love no matter what anyone tells you no matter what you read no matter who you turn to the devastation and isolation you feel is indescribable every bad moment that you think you ve gone through pales in comparison some deal with their grief by turning to drugs and alcohol some shut down emotionally and refuse to accept reality others learn to understand the situation and while sometimes feeling frustrated get on with their lives the best way they can or at least try mother died a few years ago and guess my way of coping with this was to immerse my life with music in particular dance music t pulled me out of the darkest realms and made me feel human again these days dance music in one form or another is the only music listen to so much so that d forgotten that more commercially accepted music could have just as much of a profound affect on me as does listening to that perfect progressive track to be honest if had known the affect s would have on me it s quite possible would not have listened to this cd from the first track to the last cried like a wounded child the brilliance of this cd lies in the tragedy it evokes with each track leaving a rather haunting after effect the promotional material received with this cd described as a collection of love songs think what they really are is a collection of songs that show heartbreak and sadness this is music that reveals a person s raw emotions a person that s been stripped naked and left vulnerable is a 23 year old who hails from berlin with being his follow up to the critically acclaimed nfinite songs at such a tender age m amazed at the fragility he has been able to express in his music and if there was one person to whom would compare him it would be the late jeff buckley much like buckley hecker bares more of his soul with each track and with each listen a certain sadness is revealed opens with the stark yet powerful with this very track hecker establishes a sense of loss and loneliness that prevails throughout this cd n some way with each track he tells a different piece of the same story t s a story that revolves around loss regret yearning and most importantly hurt this is made clear in tracks such as and t is especially abundant in the way hecker uses his vocals not just on these tracks but in all of them up until each track has been quiet and austere filled with lush strings and piano riffs with hecker seems to have woken up and realised that it s not all about tears and regret nstead of sweeping sounds we now have the sound of basslines and beats which is even further explored with s nsane with its almost drum and bass like beats this particular track is my favourite and what was somewhat of a surprise on this otherwise remorse cd however this upbeat momentum does not last and with that sense of loss returns and is maintained until the end with the title track overall this is a collection of the most beautifully tragic songs have ever heard this is certainly not something you want to be listening to when upset yet at the same time that s exactly what we do: we all listen to tragic love songs when we ve lost someone we love would be surprised if one or all of these songs did not affect the most hardened person with the combination of gorgeous music and s vocals the affect is a lasting one as for me without that jolt in my life don t think would be where am today and if that wasn t the case there is so much would have lost out on and completely missed certainly don t think would ever be sitting here on this winter s day writing a review about a collection of songs that have affected me as much as has as much as this has been a personal journey for it has been just the same for me once lay dormant for me has been awakened again there are things that had forgotten which remember again that will be thankful to this man with the fragile voice that has reduced me to tears this has been a truly personal difficult review to write and one won t forget treasure the life have the people know the things ve experienced but for now think ll go for a walk
sherwood pinch 2 bring me weed 2 sherwood pinch 2 (dubplate pressure mix)
bleak slow-rolling techno thats what mike jefford specializes in with his project two eps hes released so far were both short sinister trips bearing cryptically titled tracks usually pitched between 100 and 115 bpm jeffords debut album and the first for sighas label continues in similar fashion resulting in an immersive listen with few bumps along the way shows jefford is at his best when he lets his tracks grow and mutate carving out extra bits of texture and dialing in more tension with each passing measure is one example: over a tumbling kick drum it lets out reverberated squelches that sound like an acid line turned inside-out and puts hair-raising drones just off in the distance but its the all-in moments that are the highlights like and tter former descends with lean syncopated percussion scrambled analog noise and cavernous chords while the latter though it starts with some warm earthy techno ultimately leaves beats behind and dissolves into a dark-ambient soundscape re are a few less compelling efforts here first track is a mostly nondescript drone though it does cleanse the palette and while and might serve well as an early build and mid-album respite both lack the nuance that characterizes the rest of the album still those tracks dont detract much from the journey which winds down on a promising note with the almost ten-minute a slightly swung cut of shimmering atmospheric techno its the warmest and brightest thing jefford has produced even with the gloomy growls and echoed clatters at its end all in all his appreciation for space and detail make a fine debut full-length
a new release from fawned over frenchman p p bradock is always something to get excited about in the case of this imbroglios ep on his own avatisme though it may take a while: theres no instant classic la ep burnt or path of most resistance but instead four relatively complex cuts that take more than a few listens to really understand its almost like two or three different film strips are running on top of one another at the same time during katoucha with streaming organ lines subliminal bass pulses and shuddering claps all adding up to something chaotic but controlled though much of bradocks music could be described as soundtrack-y is an extreme example of that disjointed roughshod piano notes squealing synths and rattling harmonies bring to mind everything from phosphorescent plankton to newly spawned micro bacteria is likely to prove the eps most enduring and playable joint: complete with extra loud cat purring samples thin melody lines and more micro percussive details the arrangement eventually convalesces into colourful unhinged but skippy deep house 12turn13 goes deep and introverted in its many layers hiding vocal echoes amongst dissonant chords as a flapping bottom end ticks along at a fair lick perfect for those trippier late night hours
with this release on rush hour steve has effectively tripled his solo production output in one fell swoop (easy when you only have a single track to your name ) here the rinse fm dj appears on dutch institution rush hour with tunes that reflect both associations the former pirate radio station has opened its doors to more continental european styles over the past few years and both tracks sound about as house as youd expect nonetheless theres a certain approach to low-end that runs through each that could only be the work of someone from the uk (or someone that only started listening to house after coming through the hardcore continuum) seems like its going to march in place with random swells and bells throughout but more than halfway in a melody starts to make itself known if its not really obvious thats probably the point just wonky enough to be interesting just floor-driven enough to keep you dancing is more immediately arresting taking a lengthy sample from a recording of ella fitzgerald standard (if you cant sing it) youll have to swing it (mr ) it doesnt sound like fitzgerald the singer is too sweet although that may just be down to the tinkling organ it takes nearly two minutes to grab a beat but by the time it does youre already hooked
when thomas melchior and daniel bells collaborative track surfaced last month the main question it brought to mind was why hadnt they done this sooner s two of minimals top dogs melchior with his featherweight melodies and nimble beats and bell with his earworm basslines and technoid funk have done more than most in shaping the styles sound ( y even look alike ) yet here they were as laying down their first official collaboration a sprawling ten minute groover that brings out the best in both artists called its anyones guess when it was made its abrupt intro and outro suggest that its just a snippet of a cosmic studio session if perfect house tracks exist is one of them with a breathy vocal snippet it skews towards melchior but bells techy drive is there both producers are bassline masters so unsurprisingly the fat rhythmic low end is bliss tick of open hi hats comes and goes later entwined with a heavenly synth riff and a sustained pad a collaboration between melchior and fumiya tanaka as is more upfront its straightforward bassline and kick hammers alongside the slapping percussion often heard in tanakas tunes while twinkling keys offer a glimpse of light during its middle section its a heavier option which makes it better suited to a partys busiest hours
ever since she left danity kane s solo work has tended towards the epic and grandiose on records like armor on and goldenheart she sang of a fraught love story like it was an episode of game of thrones all warfare surrenders and royalty she used mainstream dance music as a huge soundtrack for it all culminating in last years blackheart a record full of dazzling production and seductive left turns at the beginning of (and her self-proclaimed red era ) however richard pivoted moving from a staunchly independent self-released model to london label local action and working with well-known dance producers first we got not above that a storming single made with machinedrum and now we have an ep of kingdom collaborations for more than just a clever singer-production pair is richards most striking and intimate music yet is naked both musically and lyrically kingdoms beats are unusually spare almost rudimentary the effect is most impressive on t a hip-hop-style brag that feels like last years blow stripped to the bone all clean snaps and an incredible four-note bassline that undergirds the chorus on and t richard gets personal over equally guarded beats like club-ready confessionals drum breaks well up in the peripheries of a story of a love-hate affair t is among richards most beautiful tracks with long flowing melodic lines and magnificent self-harmonizing the ep wraps up with which brings biblical imagery into the equation the drum breaks return but now they sound celebratory as richard sings so please be forgiven / let me baptize you t ends her four-track saga one that shows she doesnt need to embellish her songwriting with production wizardry and experimental beats
questions swirl around s first proper mix in more than five years oes a man renowned for his dance music pedigree still have the magic that lets face it pretty much shaped modern house music can stand out in turbulent digital times where the mysticism of a track something he believes in more fervently than sasha is rendered null and void by downloads and blogging will the man who invented the marathon set and etched the template for ketamine house still cave heads with the same abandon that spawned a thousand steve lawlers f you let the music speak doesnt have all the answers ts a mix that certainly doesnt veer in the dark and exciting terri ry his previous mixes reveled in f anything proves that no one does better than because although he does evoke moments of the old magic seems happy retire the trailblazer moniker and slide gracefully in elder statesmen mode over two expertly programmed discs paints his sound with almost rothko like simplicity limiting his set the darker colors of his musical palette and rarely brightening the set with the screaming diva a cappellas that frequently and brilliantly contrasted the boom and shuffle in the past having a residency at in biza rather than the flamboyant nyc clubs of old has seemingly added a more serious ne his sound you feel playing europeans has made his sound more direct more mean and a just a little less inventive thats not say that this is an average set n fact it has all the trademarks of classic t first disc shimmies by effortlessly through s lush the camp fricanism of s bodydrummin before almost slipping over the sleaze and sweat that emanates from s cant e with fter a tight and taut middle half hour flush with rhythm and power the hoover stabs and bit crusher riffs that drive s cheap and nasty seem a bit obvious but redeems himself with a blissful set of sublime techno cuts close out the disc starting with bumpin s snarling he bulldozers in the rolling old school swagger of by with a viciousness reminiscent of the u days before closing out with his own hi camp lo slung robo house cut second disc is a superior set with a darker more linear feel that resembles the end of one of his miami marathons he rides a slippery techno beast that pulses breathes and thrashes relentlessly through the strobe; the marching by is as close trademark tribal as youll find here and you feel the relish with which he whips in the funky as fuck by a pumping percussive number that would get even the staunchest booty moving by the time he expertly puts things on the simmer with you embrace the slinky and sexy re edit of s with open sweaty arms gnore the senseless vox of its a poser as a set closer and finish on ndreas s sublime a gorgeous tech house number that sparkles through a hazy dawn of melancholic synths n times like these where house seems fenced in corners of aquatic deep house bone dry minimal and crisp ble n electro its easy forget how easily turned his sheer contempt for genre in a sonic sorcery that bewitched generations of clubbers and influenced selec rs as disparate as fanciulli and luciano that in mind is disappointingly two dimensional and safe but its still a great mix from a dark disco master who after over twenty years in the game is as good as any player out there
intergalactic research institute for sound is a new project from the georgia born berlin based dj producer promoter and visual designer kiziria having established his techno credentials solo and as half of i/y aims to use his institute to present more abstract styles of electronic music the label makes a strong start with the evocative ambient forms of / de sounds from georgia the 33 minute compilation which features alongside five other georgian artists impresses with a wide range of well executed pieces with towering pads and airy distortion from (aka aux field) is the records most upbeat moment while s aptly titled is its most melancholy with a wandering minor key synth line thats built to go on forever s weaves glimmering tones stormy rumbles and glitchy sound design into a mini epic that brings to mind the futuristic vibes of alva notos xerrox series the dark efforts from a few lesser known producers are just as intriguing a resident at the key tbilisi techno club bassiani offers a slow building eight minute cut of superbly moody downtempo s unfurls a panoramic aural portrait of some churning industrial cityscape while severians conveys a sparse and shadowy sort of intimacy
the latest release on peter s label welcomes a new producer to the roster while also reminding the listener of the importance of 90s techno there are moments on s when i had to pinch myself to make sure that i wasnt listening to a post-eye q trance opus from pascal feos or kanzerlamt thats a compliment by the way; the sweeping chord sequence that dominates is the epitome of teutonic bluster yet there is something infinitely soulful within its epic arrangement its evocative emotional and thanks to the wonders of modern production technology relentlessly effective as zenker solders grainy coruscating beats to push the track through a series of climaxes y contrast s remix is utterly now both in its design and sounds like his recent remix of samuli kemppi the elgian producer lays down a complex framework of rolling breakbeats and splintered beats which sound functional and relentless this approach is softened somewhat by the use of a dubbier version of the original versions chords but the addition of an industrial strength grime-caked bassline ensures it kicks angrily the only downside to s latest rework is that if he maintains this form it may become difficult for him to devote time to his own work side from this minor concern is a worthy addition to technos past-future continuum

has spent chunks of this decade in archival mode from 2012s complete works series to this summers return to the crucial 96 album gymnastics that stronger fitter version of the album in which tracks were re-mixed from the original stems highlighted the foresight and terrifying brutality of the early birmingham sound live n n y c brings the point home recorded in a new york club in january 97 (and recently rediscovered by the producer evan kreeger) its no surprise that these tapes favour gymnastics classics is presented in an alt version that steers the originals stiff frantic aggression into swampier zones and are straighter retreads except the latter is pitched down a third for some reason as with many live recordings they swap studio precision for an in-the-moment energy that still roars out of the speakers two decades later two bonus treats round off the ep both favour noxious synth sculpting over forward momentum their phasing atonal loops bathed in delay these too have a dank dimension lacking in the studio originals thanks to some heavy reverb settings live n n y c doesnt hold too many surprises but its a valuable document of a key techno moment
this is a suitably entitled 3 tracker of techy disco grooves the title cut is as sleazy as soho alleyway with soft bongos dirty disco guitars and a spoken word sample that encapsulates the term sleaze and injects it into every orifice next up dicky trisco offers a more driving alternative stripping apart the vocals and letting the drums do the talking finally party in paris maintains the disco feel but strips it back to basics for a quality rolling dub mix
is a serious disco nerd hes been disco-obsessed since the 70s and understands the genres subtleties innately having explored almost every mutation throughout the last 30 years even so is one of his career-best tracks capturing the spirit of a musical golden era it focuses on hyper-specific sub-genres jazz-funk and disco-dub and expertly translates their nuances with a result that sounds like powerlines double journey mixed with dinosaur ls bang 5 considering the stellar production values of those records both mixed by the inimitable fran ois k thats high praise rest of the ep is solid but not exceptional features regular dego collaborator kaidi tatham on keys you can hear tathams contribution not just in his masterful playing but also in the authentic boogie sounds he coaxes from the synths nto featuring and is flamboyant with hints of a def mix production its poppy vocals will be loved or loathed black remix of wont a loopy dj tool that recalls the shuffle of z diz productions from the 90s is the packages curveball is enjoying a spike in popularity so its fitting that a genre veteran is producing work as fine as
say what you will about way that anonymous producer has conducted himself on online social networks; his music has always seemed to me anyway to speak far louder and much more eloquently than his words signing an ep to hyperdub is in itself no small feat and resulting self-titled double pack has since been used as a comparative yardstick after blew bloody and stumped doors f dubstep rule book with an array arrpegiated skwee-tronics and classic computer game-style synth hooks does much same pinning erratic wandering game over melodies against solid 4x4 kick drums on pumpkinheads fusing sharpened minor key riffs around circulating haphazard bass on and fusing similar 8-bit twisting melodies around crunching kick drums on bobble but real moments where s processes shine are on tracks that sound noticeably richer and fuller like stop/start contorted pads bubble dream synths and title track which pins sawing keyboards against a solid 2-step beat that comes complete with duel snares that clip/clop out unison giving beat essential swing it needs to worm into your subconscious and are superb examples eschewing his trademark halcyon coated arpeggio in favour some cyclical sparse keyboard-heavy 2-step its sound veering away from noodlesome snatches melody as displayed (admittedly very impeccably) on which comes complete with a snare that sounds like that last forced suck on a straw when your soda pop glass is emptying out and into solid glistening production charm someone like martyn who much like has a stylistic palette all his own it feels like has a cunning plan luring you in with promise what is essentially a collection beautifully skewed and slanted beat sketches ( longest track is just 4:17) but with a powerful quintet grown man productions included ep chooses instead to make your body work in conjunction with music buy this and youll get probably most complete peek into hard drive one dubsteps most promising idealists to date
for a guy who lists the meandering proggy sounds of yes and king crimson as influences on his myspace sure is single-minded in his approach to electronic music both tracks here do remarkably little more than bang away in search of a groove jackson finds it on in the form of a rolling techno groove that showcases yet another side to his varied production abilities jackson for those who arent familiar came up with deep house and nu disco imprints tronicsole and glasgow underground here however hes mining a lightly hypnotic techno thread and bringing in enough melody to get the border community types excited as well ( la bc the glam mix which turns up on the other side is a hyper-melodic dj tool that could have been penned by holden himself ) on the other hand goes back to his roots: its a deep house number that should fit neatly into sets of those working both the mannheim and new york varieties warm and chunky jackson rides the line between both and ends up with a pleasant little tune its the better of the two but no matter: the wide stylistic gulf between each track augurs well for his forthcoming full-length confusingly also titled based on this it looks as though we can expect an album and not a simple collection of tracks
are masters of refinement consistently able to shrug off the feeling of staidness despite a penchant for the classic techno templates the key mostly seems to lie in the duos slick question-and-answer type compositions melodies are simple hypnotic and almost never operate alone in for instance the gaps in the sparse bassline are filled with flaring chords and the even smaller spaces between them are occupied by a dreary two-note drone soloed any one of these elements might seem tedious but in concert they act like a well-oiled machine each component hard to separate as a more complex whole emerges the aptly-titled is simpler than most of the duos work rapidly unfurling brightly-hued chords like a flag in the wind not much happens after this a few chokes with a filter here a bass cut there but its galloping effectiveness is hard to argue with

fter a lengthy gestation period its taken a re-firing of thinkings records imprint which was according to the man himself forced into hiatus after only one release to finally bring the bubbly brilliance of ristol producer s to wax it might seem hard not to lump the synthesized style of in with the purple trinity sound but from the opening melee of swirling distortion and glitched synth loops its evident s got his own approach to production fusing foreign textures and found sounds with zipping percussion its when the crippled pianos pang into life and the drawn-out snare reverberates and breathes on until the end of the bar that you know you got something special in your hands is an anthemic slice of ristol that leans on the progeny of the citys peers to overwhelming effect its main riff is truly memorable and oh-so-devastating when thrown in as a curve ball into a teched-out mix on the other side meanwhile is a reworking by fellow ristolian peverelist flipping the catchiness and style of the original on its head while still keeping with his rolling minimal tendencies pev doesnt touch s main melody concentrating on the arpeggiating synth line that ran as a backup in the original he seasons this snatched hook with layers of effervescing bass and constant punishing percussion before unleashing a torrent of off-kilter melodics that will either make or break your listening experience
much of the critical attention paid to in the past two years has tracked his delicate refashioning of styles ranging from dubstep to techno to house into a sound all his own yours truly has been as guilty as any of breathlessly cataloguing the musical decoupage that has allowed to step out from generic convention into a fluid formulation different from all else out there call this a bad habit but its also been necessary considering the subtle manipulations of micro-genres on his records washington dc-based dutchmans debut full-length is the culmination of his broad-reaching experimentation to date album broadly is divided into two parts with the first seven tracks followed by a beatless interlude and then seven more but its two tracks that leap out on first listen: right star and se duo both appearing in the albums first half are the ones receiving repeat canings from dubstep djs and rightly so: yre both not only catchy but also warm and uplifting as well right star is anchored by an enormous bassline that feels like it was made out of 800-fill goose down se steps harder and is combined with d- s extraordinary vocal which tells a rueful story of love and loss in the albums most delicate moment on the second half the free flow between straight and stepping beats continues atmosphere draws darker in this section which wears its garage influences more overtly st and insanity are journeys into the dirty underbelly to which so pleasantly alludes trio feels more familiar than some of the music here and lacks a certain vitality as a result nevertheless they share the incredibly precise and polished production values that give the rest of the albums glassy surfaces their irresistible shimmer something you can easily hear on the stone-cold technoid glower of the 4/4 : or which is a syncopated study of louche charm its tone sitting halfway between swagger and a shrug voluminous sonic feast extends all the way to the beatless abstraction of manipulates genre elements here as building blocks subservient to musical meaning rather than predictors to that end he employs a structure of beats that progress seamlessly from the most solid bass foundations to the most rachitic webs of snares right star and se on their own would surely be amongst the strongest singles of this year but provides more than that: its a complex organic and compelling alternate world it has preserved the sheer joy taken by the most reduced dubstep and combined it with the ephemeral pleasure of house in a climate dominated by competent singles that are rightly forgotten soon after their release is an album that expands in stature with every listen
a respected collaborator of the likes of ricardo villalobos moritz von oswald and tobias freund has only released one other solo record 2013s transparenz given the ensuing gap you might expect his return to be an avalanche of pent-up ideas but if anything the german synthesist has got more tight-lipped with time will lynch identified a drab romance in the austere synthscapes of transparenz matched by the grey cloudscape on its sleeve this eps cover by s in-house illustrator jake fried features an even darker woodland scene in which only outlines can be picked out in the dim moonlight the music matches were very much in where the colour palette is narrow and the gestures restrained and cautious the musics scale has reduced from transparenz s broader kosmische panoramas into a series of up-close miniatures but its as rich as ever you just have to lean in closer most of the ep scuds along on a furtive pulse on its in the synth arps clambering over each other like spiders while background textures grow to a dull roar s dry tones throb and hum to a more neutral tune and the brighter is almost playful its sour metallic tones ping-ponging across a broader drone space the track develops a subtle shuffle as it goes which leads nicely into whos the closest thing to a dance track from a producer known for his work with techno legends not that youll be hearing this on too many dance floors: its electro-ish groove is sluggish and smeared nudging gloomily under the eps most downcast bit of melody in all this grey two slightly more expressive tracks stand out s polysynth tones drift between majesty sourness and moments of tender optimism leaving viscous decay trails in their wake the same reedy sounds return on where after a couple of minutes a rumbling bassline throws their wandering patterns into a redemptive new light its a dramatic moment of catharsis at least by the standards of this humble ep
the imaginary land that xavier thomas references on his fourth solo album as d bruit where ancient west africa cohabits with 80s new york isnt uncharted territory david byrne first travelled there on his 1981 collaboration with brian eno my life in the bush of ghosts which melded afrobeat rhythms and early sampling techniques with talking heads jerky funk more recently and further east in democratic republic of congo mbongwana star dropped post-punk guitars and spiky bass into the eclectic stew of african and american influences on from kinshasa one of this years most thrilling albums even thomas himself has previously dabbled in african sounds both on 2013s collaboration with sudanese singer alsarah aljawal and nigeria what from 2010s spatio-temporel ep on the french producers from the horizon lp the continent was just one of myriad global influences if from the horizon made thomas seem to have perennially itchy feet sees him resting them for a spell the rhythms are much more linear and less spasmodic the sounds more relaxed the proto-house house of is his most conventional dance floor cut to date: its serpentine bassline is adorned by little more than a few squeaky synths and its all the better for it the ricocheting echoes in tracks like suggest that thomas biggest musical touchstone these days might be jamaican dub the percussive roll of brings to mind nozinja s shangaan electro but most of the obvious african signifiers like the sampled chants on seem designed simply to add a splash of colour to the synthetic sounds is slickly produced but its distorted guitars have the same lo-fi feel as bands like konono no 1; the way some of the synths wobble sound like theyve been plugged into the wavering power supply of an african metropolis is a temporal trip as well as a geographical one the analogue synths in and not only sound like john carpenter but disorient like a sci-fi time machine gone haywire the albums psychedelia comes from the way sounds seem to bend around the edges theres a faint seasickness to the guitars and stumbling organ on it all makes a heady brew worth diving into
math rock emperors saw their crown knocked askew after a lukewarm reception to their second album gloss drop last year ut if this first in a four-part series of 12-inch vinyl remixes is evidence the album is about to have new life breathed into it the first outing sees two of kompakts much-garlanded musicians the and gui coming to grips with the material you know what you are getting with the former; true to form xel wilner takes the merest hint of the original and then loops it adding a smattering of digital snares and a heavy bagpipe drone theres no denying its raw beauty and hypnotising soothing qualities but you wonder how much longer the will be able to pull off variations of the same trick in contrast razilian producer gui loads up his reworking of with more ideas than an pple r d brainstorming session its like some alternative ond theme with a twanging rock roll guitar riff percolating throughout its seven-minute duration washes of strings waft the perfume of the kasbah behind it offset by a collection of digital squeaks and trills its a bona fide bar-raiser

1999 was a massive year for electronic music it was a year where boundaries were torn down and legends created no longer confining itself underneath to a niche market electronica began to spread like a wildfire across the planet a whole new era of music lovers exploring and experiencing new sensations with the help of the most gifted djs and magical producers painting lush cords and melodies for the soundtrack to your life big track after big track 1999 was a year that everything came together with my opinion the biggest track of that year to close the 1990 s in epic proportions space manouevres stage one was for a new generation s defining moment in the influence and emotional journey that could be had with or without the use of enhancements using vocal samples off the event horizon trailer as the backdrop stage one became a modern classic it s follow-up the pluto disko was a letdown in comparison with the success of the first release but now nearly five years since the original release of stage one the wait has been worth it as s space manouevres pt 3 is the true sequel that everyone has been waiting for ear candy from start to finish be prepared to witness one of this generation s best producers at his finest the original mix sees john creating a blissfully layout of tight drums and warm synths layered between keifer sutherland s vocal (just the addition of keifer sutherland s voice increases the cool factor) the atmospheric samples off of dark city gives an eerie and mysterious listening experience that doesn t go too dark and serious built around swirling perpetual sounds that injects with deep and dubby house grooves that is the hallmark of as the subtle percussion builds and builds the entrancing melodies and submerging basslines add a third dimension of resonance anticipation is constantly building and once all this falls into place keifer sutherland s voice returns in full scale as those memorable lines from the beginning of the film come in once the minimal breakdown builds again it draws deeper into the chamber until the rush of euphoric melodies is fully release the track of no one i mean no one should have an excuse to not have a copy of this in his or her bag of tricks and treats the flip offers a different spin on things s breaks mix is a strikingly piece of ghostly bliss john manages to constrict an entirely new track with melodic breaks that interfaces with keifer sutherland s voice everything here is teased throughout the entire way as the elemental sound-scape is embrace with the breaks nothing is hit hard and nothing is left undone with the main rhythm growing strongly to enhance the vocals using keifer sutherland s voice to lead the way for the finale lush melodies sphere heads the end of a journey powerful the breaks mix is a bonus addition for an already provocative release call john graham whatever you want: kanna stoneproof (1/3 of) tilt or the space manouevres but one thing for sure whatever alias he decides to take the result will undoubtedly be quality the main man behind the space manouevres has finally delivered the 3rd chapter in the unforgettable space series through a journey of deep and emotional peaks space manoeuvres pt 3 solidifies as one of the top producers first there was darkness then came the strangers and then there was
is an unassuming operation label boss matt densham a former swayzak affiliate has racked up about ten releases since 2009 yet hes never done an interview and most of his output receives little recognition the newest addition to its catalog comes from german duo (benedikt frey and david georgos) who first appeared on the label in 2012 with an ep of squelching house excursions called what we see the pairs latest effort the deals in slow-burning house beats that build into cosmic jams each of the five tracks follows a similar structure: they start with skeletal beats and then melodies basslines and pads rise gradually to the fore twofold circus opens with a bare kick drum and the tiniest of hi-hats and over the course of 12 minutes watery chords creep into the mix along with squelching acid notes cow bell and a heavy dose of celestial synths the technique of continually adding new elements occasionally poses a problem as the full impact of the more compelling elements is lost on for instance the bass guitar notes hi-hat patterns strings and breakdowns dilute the twinkling keys and throbbing bassline s strongest work here is a darker cut with a rubbery kick drum and tiny percussive notes in the background the tune is full of minute details tweaked-out squeaks gritty shakers crackling hand drums none of which are conspicuous enough to outweigh the others while some of the tracks feel a bit scattered feels focused
one of san fran s most talented duo s in jondi spesh return to the scene with a two track release on their very own imprint new blue dawn is a deep and intense affair from the very start as it builds with some nice flowing percussion and some deep and twisted effects and sounds some somewhat eerie patterns soon make their way into the track and help build the production especially late on as the patterns and effects become more twisted and dark breather again is intense and nicely paced from the word go and features a more intense array of effects and sounds that work nicely with the deep baseline that rides in the background it s a very nice production that adds to a nice welcome release from the us based duo

there are plenty of producers for who you can say their days are numbered but in s case thats unequivocally the case not because hes going out of vogue its just that after 95 and s go y marks the end of a series of day -oriented releases from the frankfurt-based producer what separates tresher from many of his peers is an ability to flavour his productions with zest and vigour but still steer a path around the choppy water of cheese bounces along like tigger on tartrazine; a piano motif tinkles in the background an understated bassline winds in and out and theres a decidedly teutonic bubbling groove its techno with a glint in its eye although some will argue that its a little too linear in its approach occupies a broodier place propelled there by snappy skipping hi-hats and twinkling buzzy keys that fizz and pop whenever the high tempo pauses for breath or a new element is introduced the crowd roars its approval quite literally in this case as tresher drops in field recordings from the reaction a set of his received at erghain last summer the dance music equivalent of the pplause sign smart move mr t
finnish producer lassi kaarle viljami vainionp was a latecomer to dubstep with early releases for labels like black box and innamind landing around 2011 like most artists attracted to the genre his music began to mutate as it took in ideas from other scenes over the years vainionp s latest release lands him on innaminds new sub-label and its one of his best records yet he shapes his dubwise swagger into broader 4/4 figures where the dread of dubstep gets channeled into something sleeker and more streamlined on dub techno chords drape over a lagging rhythm that feels vaguely sinister its how vainionp packs so much percussion into an otherwise stark framework that keeps things as lively as they are: may be slow but it packs a punch is a bit faster though it has the same severe poised sense of movement its the kind of wobbly techno that could find itself on a livity sound record which is high praise commodo one of latter-day dubsteps brightest prospects steps in for a remix of the title track increasing the tempo to 136 bpm and landing halfway between trap and dubstep his contribution is the odd one out on the ep but its just as well-constructed as the originals the unlikely dialogue between dubstep and techno continues to produce many great records and makes las sound on the verge of greatness himself
is the brighton-based louis johnstone a man whose all-caps twitter account paints him as something of a web-age prophet and whose prolific output for labels including astro:dynamics nna tapes and leaving makes him one of the most intriguing voices in contemporary electronic music johnstones discography over the past two years is best understood as a process of refinement: the more overt sampledelia of say 2010s caveman smack under the dem hunger alias has been gradually distilled until only the barely-there remnants of damage and decay remain with that arc in mind the excellently titled for cassette label is perhaps the producers subtlest gauziest work yet johnstone assembles these two side-length tracks out of large building blocks: 30 seconds or a minute of a single idea each cross-faded into the next moments recurring multiple times or bookending others to form oblique poetic sentences the results function like a particularly cryptic labyrinthine mini-mixtape a fine analogue for the way in which the majority of music is consumed in within that dance forms occasionally come under scrutiny: early in were treated to a baleful techno throb over which reedy synths chirrup restlessly; later on a hard-edged andy stott-esque thump holds sway for a minute or so the latter half of is dominated by a desiccated hulk of a kick drum dreamy detroit pads wheeling overhead but johnstones relationship to the current crop of noise-techno fusionists is only passing; mostly this is an album of weightless moments: delicate washes of electrical hum amplified grit in the wires burbling synth clusters and stringently buried melodics whats remarkable is the pathos that johnstone wrings from these most microscopic of sonic phenomena

is a young uk producer who makes gently broken techno his sound especially on eventide (a highlight from his resin debut) is colourful and lean a style he improves on for his debut on the equally fresh-faced label swings wildly its appeal is in the way its meaty kick is set against the floating wriggling leads a nice effect that has the physical impact of a heavy techno track without the oppressive force hodges remix doesnt reinvent so much as adjust it going slightly more linear lightly distressed and heavy on the delay effects mehringe is a dirtier take on the style with a pulsating bassline and a fantastically filthy hi-hat one-ups by swinging so drastically that it feels drunk its sandpapery chords and angry vocal samples sound a bit goofy however suggesting that is maybe better at working with melodies
markus fix and dorian paic are groove specialists like many producers associated with the frankfurt area the two have a knack for nailing a balance between form and function ts not hard to see where this comes from fix and paic are veteran djs with a clear understanding about what works on the dance floor you could just about cue up any track from the pairs respective catalogues and your set would be better for it the sixth release on hashmat ansaris records packs three more of those effective tunes judging by the enthusiastic message that comes with a release from two respected veterans like fix and paic is a big deal for ansari luckily what the record offers matches his enthusiasm and are two down-the-rabbit hole tunes with strange synth sounds and crafty drums matched to even trippier basslines is more high-impact thanks to a fat snare and retro-sounding low-end these tracks wont make or break your set but theyll come in handy no matter which room youre playing in
selected by club resident and mixed by german duo monosurround the tracks on are an apposite mixture of old and new of obscure cuts and well known moments with a bunch of citizen exclusives thrown in for good measure sure opening with the thin remix of s might be a bit o retrograde for some but considering its still stuart price miss kittin and s best work you can easily fall all over again for its string fueled epic grandeur its a feeling echoed throughout in fact by cuts inspired by n trance moods from ime ngles the expansive popof remix of veerrus s 0 and : you wouldnt head bang any of those but you shouldnt hold it against them either being vitalics label itd impossible not have some harsher moments though and its in its second half that the mix finally switches in third gear rnaud rebotini for instance offers a black strobe instrumental remix sans ivan smagghe but you couldnt tell the difference really of slightly demonic while frances own wonderboy goes for hand in the air euphoric rave y madness with (probably institubes best moment in 08 so far) nly s kraftwerkian nal bleeps sound o cute and a bit out of place at first but h r uf mit s grainy and dis rted bass line ends up feeling right at home next citizen regulars and vitalic wannabes such as and so far it seems the maximalist scene in france has been rotating around a parisian axis with attention strictly dedicated kitsun ed banger and institubes such short sighted appraisals though ignore the fact that citizen dijon based for those playing at home has also been a major force in terms of releasing brutal abrasive and compelling techno cuts that have helped rejuvenate the french electronic scene just as much as their capital city brethren in the end is more of the same in this underrated series its a compilation that feels both diverse and au go t du jour enough keep you interested for at least this summer and maybe a bit beyond nd hopefully it should make you want give the citizens catalogue some much deserved attention or at the very least become an unlikely citizen of montpellier clubbing scene

its hard to describe exactly how s nthem fails to come together but its easier to flip the question and ask well which parts of it manage to actually deliver on their promise the puzzled silence that follows says a lot about what went wrong here or if not wholly wrong then certainly nowhere near really right nthem was crafted by henrik schwarz and jesse rose two producers who know their way around some the deepest (and truth be told most dicey) aspects of where club music goes in search of humanism and soul so here together they dive into reggae with sampled vocals from arrington spence that have been cut up and laid over a bumptious bassline that carries everything else along that bassline though plays more like a tossed-off oompah caricature than anything that might signify as reggae and the keyboards that cycle through clipped patterns like something at a carnival dont help either theres a ham-handedness to it all that is surprising for schwarz and rose and a hokiness too live version on the -side proves much better thanks in part to some zealous dub tricks that abstract the whole thing and take the glare off the -sides worst missteps ut nthem isnt particularly fit to count as such no matter how its presented
coming straight from against the grains sister label is this absolute masterpiece of a breakbeat for those who have not heard of against the grain/ it is krafty kuts new label(s) which he runs alongside and freddy fresh side a sound check with krafty kuts a great intro track to any event basically this track starts off like any event/musical performance starts off - with a sound check - and the samples of a guy hosting the sound check suit the build up to this the heavy bass starts to kick in along with the horns samples and from then on this track will definitely wreck any event - its very bass heavy and phat whats even better is the breakdown probably done as a tribute to plump djs awesome remix of jds nine ways this track slows down pauses for a bit then speeds back up building up a vibe as it goes along whats that i cant hear ya my ears are ringing from all this bass side b devastate a bit more of a tribal break on the flipside decides to go into more of a early 90s rave anthem style complete with sirens and a really cheesy synth melody at the end its lovely this tune has been played at a few events recently and its one hell of a devastating track against the grain/ seems to be doing no wrong at this point in time with previous releases all getting good reviews from myself and other djs out there after browsing their website they seem to think highly of us aussies and will be collaboratiing with highly credible artists and producers from our shores - that i cant wait to see
any business school guyll tell you: its all about the networking making connections with the right people at the right time positions you for success take holy ghost the duo nicholas millhiser and alexander frankel were part of the shit-hot-for-a-minute hip-hop sextet automato ut once the group flamed out it stands to reason that millhiser and frankel casually mentioned to tim goldsworthy and james murphy of dfa who produced automatos debut that they had these analog synths just sitting in their apartments waiting to be dusted off thats probably not at all how it went of course ut there is a point: networking can only get you so far after that talent has to come into play and thats exactly what millhiser and frankel bring to their debut single with the label is one of the dirtiest little italo tunes youre likely to hear this year theres little space travel: the boys are focused on the here and now why do the good things happen in the past / streamline the news and trim the fat / i love the city but i hate my job / and this old city loves me back luckily french disco purveyor lackjoy is here to sand down the buzzing analog groove adding curlicues of funk guitar and strings thatll have you wondering whether you just stepped back into the 70s (even more so when the echo gets turned on in the second-half and things get a bit cosmic ) its a smooth ride one that cant help but remind this listener a little bit of the poppier moments from juan maclean

ever get one of those moments on a jumbo jet when you re crossing continents filled with hope for better times ahead e motion is the soundtrack to that many readers will know watson from his recent ra podcast or perhaps his track renaissance issued on planet e late last year but in fact the scottish producer has been plowing his own distinct vein of lush and organic techno for over a decade not much one for genres watson has never been an easy producer to categorise he has released on techno labels (dave angel s rotation imprint) house labels (ibadan) progressive affiliated labels (omid b s alola) and even ur s submerge output (he s one of the few non detroit artists to do so) this time his fifth (count em) full length cd arrives on detroit inspired who seem to have recognised that watson s unique talents are very much in line with their own quest to update classic techno signatures opens the album on a chirpy note it s a rhythmic shuffle with paper hi hats and a bass that bubbles under the surface but it s atypical of what is to come anyone expecting an entire album of floor orientated / rhythms should look elsewhere clarity and mindfulness are qualities present in the flowing rivers of the sound of tracks like and soft broken rhythms guide the way on the title track further pushing the album s attachment to the cerebral domain rather than the more physical atmosphere of any club an aurelon esque piece is a reminder of just how well conceived its big brother was a few moons ago this track ( ) and the infectious its with its wonderfully funky bassline raise the pulse gently providing a counterbalance to the downtempo feel of the album much like meaning of life or his remix of mr cs siren these tracks combine the emotional with natural sound rhythms to create a pacifying techno which is a joy to listen to like much of vinces work e motion is both delicate yet impossible to stop is the zenith of the album a clear night sky full of stars final curtain is the beautiful solitude a melancholic symphony of piano wispy synths and timid cymbal taps that belies those who ignorantly classify techno as music you should fear all of this should come as no revelation to those already familiar with watson a producer whose instinctual knack of weaving sonic textures with depth and sincerity has won him true fans such as francois kevorkian joe clausell laurent garnier and ur clue is in the title e motion is very much emotional electronic music forget genres forget the latest hot sounds forget the pressures of society and for one hour and eight minutes tune into something deeper

veda-who oh just a house producer with a voluminous catalog and an increasingly varied array of aliases who wants to keep his identity vague following releases from kink and humandrone his four-tracker confirms croatias as a deep house label worth watching like kinks leko and humandrones stay raw with us s grabs you by the collar and doesnt let go ts particulars are relatively simple: a repeated sequence of bright ascending chords and a slinky stripped-down house beat that makes the most of its white-hot hi-hats everything else is carefully controlled chaos much in the hip-hop-inspired mold of dj koze and pepe bradock noodly keyboard soloing drums run amok chopped-up grunts dub delay theres a lot going on but it never feels overstuffed; the whole track feels like one long extended climax the eps remaining three tracks are more restrained cloaked in basso rumble woozy vocal samples and a glassy spectral smear of keyboards features a gravelly meditation on the difference between house and techno does it really matter what plays over a chiming backdrop of pings bells piano and 303 managing to sound both murky and crystal-clear all at once while and v tip into tripped-out modal-jazz territory theyre unapologetically messy and thats just the kind of dance floor theyre meant for
the second release in finas white label series carries on the rugged bass-centric techno established by basslines without time ep this time tapping barcelona producer clip to deploy a few weapons of his own the acidy title track and the rumbling are both dark propulsive warehouse tracks their counterparts work in that capacity too even if they feel more generic dissonances may be the least distinctive of the bunch it employs a synth patch and sequence that seems all but ubiquitous: a soft pad rides one staccato chord phrase as slow hi-pass filter sweeps try to give the illusion of movement thankfully clip s drums sound more considered with big boxy kicks and sharp hats keeping things functional those drums are also the foundation of the two highlights they excel by using synths less for color than as vital components of each swung groove gradually dilutes the energy as it layers on ineffective melody but the opening half is visceral enough to warrant a spot in your next dark-techno session

so far danny bermans career which has included releases on wolf music and an album for sonar kollektiv has shown a desire to jump across genres and inject freakiness into his music his debut for stockholms doesnt veer too dramatically from that path is the first of two snarling house cuts showing off brawny kicks a bungeeing vocal and a pumping rhythm that sounds like three-quarter-pace hi-nrg a similarly raw mood infects listen closely and you can spot some hints of uk garage from the stiletto-sharp vocal stabs to double-time rhythms and hollow bass attacks perhaps the most lingering memory he leaves is where berman works some frazzled instrumental hip-hop la roots manuva the track which features massive bass and jagged beats would be a brave choice to play in dance clubs but you suspect berman would get a kick out of watching the reaction
on his ep the final release before his album drops on next year label boss flexes some new styles on top of his previously choppy mpc workouts the title track sups on some pims and proceeds to get down to a slow and jagged boogie and follow up with a more direct zest of funk zip and drum power and then wraps up his originals with an uplifting kill bill -esque comeback sequence there are three remixes on tap here kelpe sets cooly cruising along with s rhymes in the passenger seat gables remix of takes off on a more experimental tangent but is also has lighter gallic and folksy touches which help to break up the more direct and heavy tracks on the ep huesss remix of completes things with a guitar sample-driven take that doesnt move all that far from s original retro/modern bleepy funk sounds but also doesnt have to
debut album a small murmuration was one of s most fascinating moments in a 2013 full of highlights was a record that proved fabrics new label would steer away from pure dance floor fodder drew on everything from black metal atmospheres to drum bass sub ripples evoking a melancholic post party feeling full of fractured dance music tropes the remixes maintain that atmosphere even when they speak to fabrics main room richard takes the already beat light and strips it of its rhythms entirely opting instead to layer banks of synths in an oppressive droning backdrop to augustus vocal the originals oddness ramps up into something genuinely chilling matthew herberts version is more dj friendly vocal rolls away from the beat as gossamer kicks tick under a willowy bass riff its gloriously disconcerting the remixed version of sees original vocalist blue daisy team up with colleague hey zeus what was a fractured take on vangelis becomes a lithe hip hop jam with snares and kicks pounding with bared teeth as the pair trade horror core bars just like the album a sonically divergent ep is pulled together by a sense of dread this is feeling bad made to sound very good
just two releases into s mini-album series and theyve already cemented their ethos with submissions from len leise and cfcf rendering a vision of balearic in the 21st century its a sound heavily influenced by labels like ecm and windham hill full of fluttering ambience that moves at a gentle trickle so far the music has been more for spas than sunsets but the slow-moving beauty of the series is evident with the announcement that the third installment would feature germanys wolf m ller (aka jan schulte) it seemed that if not a funky world beat a heavier balearic beat was to follow schulte is no stranger to handing in no less than four remixes of jose padilla last year (the hand-stamped white label ones were particularly playful and tribal) for schultes percolating hand percussion tendencies are wedded to his partner cass (aka niklas rehme-schl ter) whose own work deeply explores the ambient side of things for the better half of the albums 16-minute title track the duo are firmly in rehme-schl ters side of the court a sound like resonating wine glasses opens the song soon mixing with strummed autoharp and field recordings of birds chortling and water gurgling it sounds so pastoral and natural that only when a bird warble spins backwards do you remember that the piece was carefully constructed despite its length the track feels like an anti-epic never gathering speed or growing louder instead its content to remain hushed and it soon slides back into the ether the breeziest 16 minutes you could hope to hear is even quieter the bubbles and chimes providing the barest of pulses duos new age sensibilities are evident throughout but schultes spritely hand drums perk up the b-side wooden thrums and struck metal brighten the pan flute and slinky bass of while most of feels like a foggy dream state closely resembles schultes remixes with his eclectic polyrhythms joined by darting buzzes and bird calls as it carefully falls away it becomes difficult to differentiate from the birds you might hear outside which seems like schulte and rehme-schl ters intent

s debut ep which dropped on samurai back in 2011 was defined by a quality usive for most young artists: maturity comprising eight tracks of tender lovey-dovey drum bass introducing presented sam reed as a devout pupil of drum bass legend calibre but what stuck out about reed was his intimate underst ing of that sounds appeal: minimalist drum tracks touched with piano the slightest bit of vocal without going overboard on the pathos he was no mere imitator the legacy of introducing has made one of the genres most quietly exciting newcomers after a stream of dance floor singles comes which fe s like a worthy follow-up to his l mark debut like many drum bass lps is loaded with high-profile collaborations but reed wrings the best out of his guests rather than letting them rule the roost the only real departure in style comes from who assists on the swooning downtempo cut elsewhere el fleshes out the stat y opener making it lif ike with quivering piano rhodes chimes a dream-team pairing with vocalist turns out as lov y as youd hope backed up with a perfect instrumental from reed his productions fe crisper trading flimsy synth instruments for bigger realer sounds the piano on wont (featuring ) booms like it was recorded in some gr cathedral the same goes for the latter of which is about as archetypal as a tune gets with drifting female vocals synths that ripple like j lyfish reed sticks to his softer side on with an emphasis on m ody egant decoration but unlike many of his peers he larg y avoids over-emoting ly with its vocal from zo gets the best of him its lyrics are too transparent its arrangement too prim proper also fe s a bit off with terse mc lines ( estate-type housing product of surroundings ) that fe half-baked whats more interesting about however is the way its harder drums seem to skitter slide forward like theyre skating on ice balancing an assertive sound with reeds egant sense of arrangement reeds approach is so measured that falls victim to calibre-album syndrome where lov y track after lov y track becomes a bit of a wash but complaining about too much of a good thing is just that the dips in quality on are few far between instead its a wistful late-summer drum bass album embracing the form instead of trying to reinvent it in choosing pure refinement the eminently approachable is bound to suck in some new fans music this gorgeous would catch anyones ear
malcolm pardon one half of swedish duo has a background in film composition i discovered this with little surprise sometime after first hearing pairs sophomore album sounds as much like a score as anything else of course the words film score can mean any number of things depending on the movie in this case however itd be some kind of epic where their first long player had moments of introspection and intimacy is all sweeping chords and bold crescendoes its the kind of stuff peter jackson probably starts the day with begins things starting from near silence its thrumming synths build dramatically for eight minutes before ending abruptly as if dropping listeners into a chasm prior to even knowing the tracks name its layers of tense synth had already imparted the required mental image take any cliff-ending chase scene by car horse or foot and youve got it too similarly opens with a deep tolling bell though its piano and misty synth work are more hopeful than the previous tracks foreboding leads the same sense of tension is present perhaps this time one can envision the inhabitants of a castle preparing for its defence a similar trick is employed for is the albeit in grimmer form setting aside further lame imaginings the epic tone of is pretty much inescapable closest the album comes to the gentle musings of its selt-titled predecessor is a three minute section towards the end with and two grainy pieces which act as a welcome breath yre the oddest of the bunch dark and quiet rest of the time things tend towards warmth; naturalistic emotive leads that reach for the sky at 11 minutes long exemplifies this at times sounding almost like a penguin cafe orchestra creation its little more than twinkling keys heavenly pads and unbridled euphoria of course theres absolutely nothing wrong with the colossal melodic structures employed here duos earnest creations arent saccharine euro trance after all each track on the album is impeccably composed their vibrant notes bounding forward with utter finesse however though its beatless or perhaps because of it the constant tension does get tiring res little pay off or at the least moments of quiet reflection seems solely an accompaniment for alps and plains some space for the bedroom and lounge would have been nice too
six years after their first release the cult label is as strong as ever following up on the comparatively high profile magic mountain high ep earlier in the year compiles four untitled tracks by a mostly unknown cast s effort melds a hip hop influenced prance with a purposeful gleaming melody that recalls joakims anthemic remix of antenas camino del sol tones things down with a prototypically narcotic cut as its shifty low slung arrangement underscores a vocalists bluesy mumbling croon the flip offers slightly more familiar faces who previously appeared on 10 contributes a techy playhouse style burner complete with tight choppy rhodes edits and a rumblingly funky bassline the finale is given to prolific swedes after several decades of under the radar activity the trio have been undergoing a serious reappraisal this year and for good reason their jerky minimalist approach is both old school and very peculiar their track repeats a simple coarse melody above a slow motion thump and while a theremin like tone fluctuates in the background the duo make sporadic attempts to screw with the other elements unassuming as these artists may be the variation on this ep proves that still feels the pulse of the european underground
affiliated with the wax:on crew from leeds magicbag has wasted no time in showing off a range of talent that takes its lead from yorkshires clubbing metropolis and simultaneously spreads its wings to encompass some relatively unknown flair from the nether regions of the house nation second magicbag sampler follows from its predecessor employing one of the uk houses leading lights on remix duties initially it was jamie jones remixing people get reals robin hood and now its simon doing the same for on the s dotbs headlining piece is a haunting piece of moody tribal funk in its own right; simon turns in a remix that is subtler than the original and which ups the tempo but not necessarily the quality louche resident favours a lightness of touch with the which relies on dubby percussive beats to keep things going but needs toughening up to really hold the interest something that gr sers does more successfully pick of the bunch for me has to be which has a nice line in concave menace and seems a bit more fully formed than the other tracks on offer its a good package though it just needs that extra special something to rise above the rest of the competition

there has always been a sense of playfulness about the camp thats why their latest release on their r w imprint comes as something of a surprise s in particular relinquishes nothing not even a hi hat as it marches sternly on it recalls tommy four sevens recent output but has spacier sound fields and is more restrained in its use of industrial sounds to create lonely shards of melody and texture the magnetism of lies instead amidst the subtleties of the whirlpool drones that circle the bass newcomer is responsible for the standout track however opening in ominous fashion with what sounds almost like a gong stratus seeps rather than marches towards a gloomy and hypnotic climax the kick drum has a particularly attractive acoustic feel to it perfect for a big system but its the gothic drones and coil like atmospheres that provide the spectacle ird watchers might notice that stratus is indeed the lack swan its completely coincidental of course but track feels something akin to a dance floor remix of the recent lack swan album on experimedia
after youve sent your last text cancelling plans for the next day nothing beats hearing a mean minimal banger on a pitch-black dance floor the romanian duo vinyl speed adjusts smooth operator packs one of these laser-guided bombs an eight-minute loop so perfect that it doesnt need to build up or down to do damage from the tough sub-bass to the precision drums every element in is primed for maximum impact the licks of synth that float above the rumbling low-end combine for a faint melody a flash of light in an otherwise rude tune best deployed with a long transition way after peak-time has passed its a hard-hitting weapon that combines technos intensity with houses groove the 12-minute a-side is more in-line with vinyl speed adjusts home scene theres a technoid pulse running through its low-end but the atmospheric effects and twanging bass synth sound straight out of bucharest has another rumbling bassline this time paired with squiggling synths and a clap that cuts through the mix smooth operator is minimal for djs who get straight to the point
for a certain type of house dj s debut 12-inch might be the perfect package released on the italian producers label is inspired by classic chicago sounds featuring two remixes by another windy city connoisseur nick anthony simoncino one of the records better moments though is when iocca takes the road less travelled after s reversed acid bassline fades out a blocky 8-bit arp pushes high into the mix until it begins to distort the smooth 303 pulse of is also good but the a-side generally sounds caught between two approaches iocca sounds undecided on whether to reproduce the chicago house style or refurbish it simoncino often does both which makes for ear-catching music his warehouse-shaking techno remix of tweaks ioccas acid squiggle into a deep purr freeing the space around it for a balanced medley of hi-hats and rides the remix pairs soft synth flares with larry heard-style hand drums in capturing the essence of his influences simoncino reveals both his familiarity with the source material and some tricks to freshen it up ioccas music might not have the same vision but as a label owner he at least shows curatorial nous
phill sebastiane better known as is the man charged with the responsibility of continuing the success of the fabric cd series due to the high quality of many of the fabric mixes the expectation of each release reaches fever pitch and as such a few of the mixes of late have fell a little short of expectations does this one fall short well yes and no the mix comprises of 13 productions from all mixed nicely and smoothly into a 74-minute package time 2 bump is the nicely executed opening tune with its smooth strings and subtle funky baseline to match don t hide is another highlight with its sampled vocals over an organ like melody and a trademark fabric house sound the mind in rhythm is another track that effectively uses subtle vocal samples over a more tribal ridden drum loop while bompazee uses a more bouncy baseline to grab your attention it is innit is a quirkier production due to its swirling percussions and our universe concludes the mix with a heavier kick accompanied with some well executed and delicate synths there is no denying that is a very talented producer from this mix alone it is clear to see just that as such there are high quality tracks that individually stand up well as a mix though some might say it lacks real depth and variety for me this is a mix that just misses the strike zone however in saying that i can easily see this appealing to many people has demonstrated some talent here a fact that should be taken into notice when you visit a record store in the near future
the opening track to s debut album encapsulates why the duo are one of s most tantalising prospects like their early ep tracks less proceeds than glides all cosmic synths cooing vocals and greg pauluss ethereal trumpet curlicues even in s apparent stillness has a limber bounce born in minnesota but long-term new yorkers paulus and nick debruyn are in their clever classically-trained way capable of fusing dilla hip-hop beats jazz and electronic music in a manner which speaks to clubland while atmospherically evoking a swelteringly hot day in 1960s harlem at their best they are a funky elusive heat haze for their debut album however they seem to have reined in their abstract tendencies to deliver a more direct set of something approaching songs songs in which their love of classic electro r b and hip-hop edge their fondness for techno this is never less than fun smartly re-treads new jack swing just as the t le track desp e s tired hunter / prey metaphor is an effective slice of pulsating dig al house at times though when they toggle between slick electro funk and smooth soul ( and to an extent it and ) they begin to sound like a refined chromeo which was never the point of or chromeo likewise the good-natured backpack-rap of or which you could almost file as acid jazz is too pol e and ineffectual re is a fine line between restraint good taste and banal y rather than kicking back might have been better off struggling to conjure the dense atmospheres in which the albums best tracks are shrouded: wriggling dreamscape or which is still sufficiently thick and heady overall sounds a l tle coy too eager to please perhaps something more radical was needed from the duo who helped the minnesota orchestra rework their track rain (all day) as a 25-minute improvisational piece whether or not these 11 tracks accurately represent what are about we shall see
theres something about early house vocals their earnestness their lack of polish and pretense that grants them a uniquely human character vocals by the likes of jamie principle and joey washington just to name two impress their emotional content on you with their sense of spontaneity but that was twenty years ago: is it possible to have such an effect today if denis kurtels latest single is any indication you can certainly come close: the vocals by guests of nature on her latest single the perfunctorily titled have a simple playful directness never becoming overbearing or sounding too glossy its a bit like listening to your friend who is a great karaoke singer you get pleasure from both the melody and a sense of fraternal intimacy marks the latest step in kurtels breezy rise having started out doing light design at wolf + lambs brooklyn parties she quickly joined the label roster and then skipped over to for a forthcoming full-length of which is a preliminary taste now some tracks hit you in the heart others smack you in the ass sits squarely in the hips like a low-worn pair of jeans the groove moves swiftly bouncing from the upbeat vocals to stretches of resonant bleeps and rising pulses with its good-time vibe the tune feels a bit like being greeted at a house party with a cold beer jamie shows off his remix versatility here by offering two distinctly different takes the mix amps the low end and winds everything tight into a hypnotic ketamine stasis that recalls jamies work in hot natured the mix is its brethrens mirror image adding some more fist-pumping energy with filtered swirls and terrific bursts of looped drums that make you feel like youre getting shot out of a cannon every 32 bars providing a dynamic linear sense of ebb and flow it completes a deep-house tryptych: party-starter late-night burner sweaty peak
zo zoe is further persuasive evidence of lithuanias growing talent pool (see also: mario vidis and planet mus few nolder) just ask maya jane coles who bagged the title track of the ep for her recent dj-kicks like its two ep siblings uses distinct rave notes in this case that means kicking off with a fat breakbeat and dynamic keyboard stabs that cease for 30 seconds to allow some mournful backward pads to join in the fun before turning full circle and heading back to the 4/4 party its a winning combination of subtlety and brutality is a more complicated affair a marriage of metallic uk garage percussion and rippling floaty dubstep-style synths on top of a bruising techno foundation tom middleton would be proud of the warm shiny analogue hug that gives you although theres no danger of you turning goo-goo over it the fizzing distorted mechanical rhythm that zo zoe underpins it with sees to that
whoevers behind knows how to play the game the french label surfaced late last year after some well-manufactured hype: long before there was a release date for its first record the outlet had a facebook page sprinkled with clips of big djs playing its upcoming tracks eventually popular deep house youtube channel cmyk posted tunes from its first record in full ll of this created a buzz that most new labels could only dream of ut does the music live up to the hype the tracks on so far have been lean and functional the kind of sunny music that most djs who play loopy house music have space for in their bag the sound has been almost too obvious however with bright synth stabs and pads simple breakdowns and chugging drums case in point: the two-track 003 its accessible with shuffling percussion and an afterhours-ready sheen and theres little doubt of its dance floor effectiveness shown by the number of top-tier djs playing these tracks 003 also recalls another sought-after sun-friendly record: tommy vicari jnrs recent the thing is vicari jnr did this day-party house sound better and weirder could find room for some innovation as it risks becoming a one-trick pony

andr lodemanns opulent digital deep house has always sounded a little bit trance-y blame that on the current landscape: whereas most deep house producers these days are focusing on making their tracks sound as raw as possible lodemann has gone in the other direction big hooks big drums big everything: lodemann doesnt shy away from a melody but doesnt come off as anything but underground lodemanns first 12-inch of the year for his own best works imprint further solidifies this reputation its release near to the first day of summer is no accident: title track sounds as bright and cheery as its name implies full of the sort of upward-building synths that make your heart want to burst when they inevitably interlock in the tracks second half also lives up to its billing keeping the sunshine under wraps in favor of a less obvious hook unfortunately it seems to go against everything that lodemanns music is about when he brings in the melody it doesnt seem like hes doing anything but offering a shadow of what might have been nobody likes a tease (especially when youve seen them put out only minutes before )
untold (hemlock label head jack dunning) and roska (wayne goodlitt uk funky figurehead and proprietor of the exquisitely named roska kicks snares label) team up for the first time here with an ep that also marks their first respective appearances on glasgows label the collaboration makes intuitive sense: both artists share a taste for chock-a-block percussion and buzzing biting sounds and thats what they give us here is unabashedly anthemic with a middle eastern lead that makes the tune instantly recognizable (i dont attend a lot of clubs where rewinds are common practice but this track seems tailor made for them ) its relentlessly energetic as roskas hard-edged conga samples tangle with untolds signature bassy squelch; shrieks and ululations fill out the sound field at critical moments adding to the sense of manic intensity slower and with a more pronounced 4/4 sensibility is clearly an attempt to put the house back in funky the press release cites kms and prescription as influences but aside from the presence of minor-key chord stabs and a wild pitch ostinato it sounds little like any of the detroit and chicago revisionism coming out of the continental european house scene for starters where neo-deep house aims for suppleness this is as brittle as a hay stalk dipped in dry ice from the staccato percussion to the bit-crushed lead thats not to say its not funky: all that clipped loping percussion gives it a powerful propulsive groove nd thats not to say it doesnt make some surprising references either: the bleating sax riff nods to big-room house tunes like enurs calabria which is funny when you think about it because commercial house of the swedish house mafia variety is currently working with very similar rhythmic ideas to those in uk funky of course this isnt mainstream house: its dark a little evil and willfully perverse (when was the last time you heard an apocalyptic reggae siren cutting through a house tune ) its success is due in large part to s ability to take well-worn tropes and flip them on their heads
despite being home to a solidly established psy-trance scene tel aviv is finally also becoming an exporter of quality house and techno but while most attention has been focused on guy gerber shlomi aber and gel abril thus far s debut artist album should vault him into the same league as that celebrated trio n fact it might just be the finest album to come out of tel aviv so far like his peers serves up a mix of the aforementioned house and techno and sprinkles it with a touch of trance and ambient but whereas late bloomers by gerber was a collection of different styles seamlessly blends these genres into one smooth sound and thats where its strength lies sure some tracks lean more towards one genre than another but at its heart theres an engaging and playful undercurrent that weaves everything together throughout ambient tracks like the subtle opener sit in perfect harmony alongside darker dance floor tracks just listen for example to how easily the spaced out bleeps of flows from the wake of the hardest track on the album future single a blistering marriage of minimal and melody and the emotional evince the future arrival of a mature neo-trance in much the same way as last years xico can wait by roland klinkenberg elsewhere is a quirky piece of house that you could imagine rocking terrace bars well into 009 the title track which also happens to be the finale seems to pull all of js skills together for one last meltdown of swirling synths theres not much to criticize here but the retro sounds of both and sound slightly dated compared to the contemporary feel showcased on the rest of the album f youre a dark percussion hound this isnt likely to be your thing is all about atmospheric instrumentals that rather than harking back to bygone sounds signal a bright future for melodic electronic music for those who like it deep is inspiring and truly immersive

true to the usual bullshit-averse attitude of his imprint peverelist is keeping background details on the producer behind this ep to a minimum we know that this outing for s sister label dnuos ytivil is s debut and that he has another coming up on hessle audio aside from that theres an obvious desire to let the tunes do the talking here thats fine though because as is generally the case with livity and livity-associated releases the tunes are excellent has a slightly less manic but similarly intense percussive spine as hodge used on dnuos ytivils last release the excellent amor fati a riotous hail of bass drums toms and splintering snares it adds various industrial wheezes and distorted screams along the way to produce a slice of rough grainy techno has a slightly more stretched-out but no less vital feel a bleak and restless beast it only occasionally breaks its central emphasis on slowly thumping bass with freakout synth digressions and dense foggy howls
returns to his own with two moody melodic and crunchy tracks suitable for peak time floors kicks off with a throbbing melody the precursor to the beats and bass line the overall arrangement is clean and tight with chords underpinning a soft and cosmic melody this is a real after hours number that grooves along but is neither overly clever nor complex with squelchy sinful but organic samples towards the 4-minute mark the swinging chords build and arouse the listener with the melody warping and punching in and out forced fiction is a bit more detroit inspired with short shakers a slightly more aggressive melody and simple samples and bleeps which carry the track along things get interesting around the 3-minute mark when constructed warbles begin piercing the sound system and the number really peaks overall this latest release from is a tight two-track ep which again illustrates a sound purveying modernity twisted with sonic chords of serotonin
the inner city mans third mix for trust the dj is a varied affair subtitled deep space it proves to be much more than that as we traverse eighteen rhythmic blockbusters it takes a while to get going the introductory build up perhaps a bit too long but then it bursts out of the blocks and into some samba techno yes thats samba techno - jesse garcias latino activo really putting some stress on the ivories with a similar piano riff cropping up later in areas habana tekto the mix storms onward some really pumping stuff from deetron mark williams and tim taylor v andy slate and saunderson himself presents inner citys say something changing the direction of the mix at just the right moment from here on its classy cuts from the likes of bryan zentz and sean colt before the ghost of good life returns in devilfishs man alive that distinctive old school keyboard sequence sounding as sharp as it ever did the deep space techno then plays out with renato cohen and ignition technician who throws his hands in the air along with the rest of us the more you listen to this excellent cd the better it gets - another essential selection from trust the dj
i m not quite sure what a bambusbeat is but i like the sound of it stepped into the limelight confidently with last summer s doppelwhipper a track that made many a top ten list in 200 his second full length album does not disappoint flying out of the gates with the bouncy and light-hearted ananda delivers eight upbeat energetic numbers no dark and moody elements at work here is full of positivity and bounces along with a jig in its step the album s underlying motif is percussion with african drum rhythms providing a textured soundscape throughout it s easy to lose yourself in the subtle shifts and gradual builds of the relentlessly hypnotic beats there s also an energy to it that keeps the album moving along effortlessly try as you might you won t be able to resist dancing to it the first half of the album is pure dancefloor has a bit of a house feel to it albeit with carnivalesque rhythms and a hypnotising repetitiveness is more aggressive and driving perfect for peak time with lush basslines and high-octane synths takes things a step further swapping groove for a subtle build that launches into a wash of mad decaying synth sounds rinse and repeat the next two tracks show another more jazz influenced side to ananda his production skills on are second to none: masterfully cutting and pasting the live jazz drums of oliver frank ananda puts together a detroit pastiche using only bassdrum hi-hat snare and a bassline it s a fresh and original approach is something different all together a proper laid back jazz number albeit one with some weird and wonderful elements thrown in namely a sample of the howls of ananda s pet dog sisha the most classically ananda track on the album is a live version of a bit of a look backwards perhaps as the original version was released on treibstoff in 200 with a psychedelic trance-like feel to it this is the little brother of doppelwhipper minus the huge drops finally the relaxed and down tempo built on lush piano key strokes cools things down nicely closing the album on a sweet note it s warm and deep and it ll leave you with a grin on your face and a feeling of satisfaction with ananda has put together a cohesive album from start to finish not just a compilation of singles as a side note the two bonus cd tracks and are excellent as well good job mr ananda
go way back out of london and nine members deep fusing free soul elements such as jazz hip-hop house funk and reggae (or anything with a groove) the influence of bugz is often underestimated new album promises rewind requests all notting hill carnival long the first carnival float is playing no more a nicely souled out percussive number that ll put smiles on faces with its light keys and dreamy melody move aside follows dropping low and ghetto with crunchy street snippets and punchy vocals intoning sorted sorted with bembe segue at the mic and seiji orin on drum programming this is one of the bigger cuts on the album and it really works live proving djs and producers can cut it in the flesh with bembe segue again on vocals (and she s done a lot of broken beat tracks) redhanded is the first real broken number and its tricky drums and sinister percussion will get you thinking about your steps on the floor meanwhile consequences is a downtempo cut with cosmic samples and stardust keys with vula assisting bembe at the mic and kaidi tatham on keyboards consequences will spark with sa-ra and platinum pied pipers fans rocking spots like cielo mid-week with its grimed-up basslines it don t work like that is deep too intelligent and too genre-bending to rock the council estates it s one of the best tracks here vula takes full control of vocals and she s smooth emotional and glitzy while drum programming comes courtesy of cliff scott my money is on kenny dope dropping this late late in the evening right i ve finished my jerk chicken just in time for happy days will the fonz be busting some shapes to this it s a disco-tinged baggy-jeaned entry with sultry vocals by yolanda quartey this is a hands-in-the-air affair i can hear it spinning early on maybe at the end with phil asher or domu at the decks most edits here have seen the nine deep collective works in pairs or threes but don t stop the music pretty much involves everyone with vocal chants over fx/samples and grungy basslines it s nice to hear bugz having fun elsewhere the dancefloor friendly inna row pushes us around with jumpy keys juicy chords and uplifting vocals courtesy of vanessa freeman bugz have ditched their earlier instrumentals in favour of song-based structures on this album and worla hurt is the pinnacle of it: a nice and slow nod to rhythm and blues and when sunday evening at the carnival draws to a close the fonz will have one more request: with its catchy video booty la la crossed over big this is not a new edit its release a few months ago took the industry by surprise introducing the bugz collective and the broken beat scene to the charts on fabric 12 needed to push the boundaries more production-wise and thankfully sounds tight but this is more than just another album and another project to plug these guys should be proud of their year-long project: the result is one of the summers most catchy quick-footed and bouncy albums top marks also go to its stage crossover potential: this album will unwind live right up there with booka shade or the acts on 2020 vision jiggy beats souled out grimed in will be replayed again and again on myspace it s the sound of a london collective sounding too damn tuff to beat

before pierre serafini made all-over-the-map beat music as opti and he also ran a neat little label called airflex labs hes now settled into knife-edged techno that cuts its own path between uk-style experimentalism and continental orthodoxy is the first release from a new label out of paris called and its a promising record for everyone involved the ten-minute title track is probably the one thatll grab you at 132 bpm its a formidable slab of techno with an electro-inspired twitch like something objekt might play its well put together and not terribly austere thanks to the abstract synth melodies in the background the key to is in the hi-hats: after a lengthy build they come in stiff and rigid forcing a grid onto the otherwise broken groove works with the same template as while the slower defutata gestures towards bristol with its surly broken beat what comes through is serafinis way with percussion his rhythms feel strangely organic and his drums tend to slip and slide instead of merely marching forward listen to the frantic percussion on its like tribal electro with long builds high-drama melodies and a keen ear for rhythm serafini has delivered his most intriguing record yet
oth of s debut tracks gaze long into the distance and operate on vast horizontal landscapes for their meandering ten-minute durations they land pretty much fully formed and barely break stride slowly shapeshifting courtesy of various minimalistic melodies and drifting ethereal spirits s main feature is drunken hiccupping synth sounds which tumble up and down in front of long downbeats and slinky hi-hats s you gradually come under the dial bosss spell he wakes you up every so often with what sounds like a skype dialtone floating miles above before allowing you to sink back down into his oh-so soft pillow of beats kurma (a japanese mountain is a japanese tea) is slightly grittier by comparison its bassline grinds as much as it rolls and theres a tension in each bar that contrasts with the decidedly detached dreamy aura of the flip
it is perhaps something of a risk for fabric to have chosen to mix so soon after the disappointment of balance 016 and while hes in the midst of promoting a new album it would have been easy to say that theres just a bit too much going around at the moment nothing could be further from the truth however as is a return to (mix cd) form for s bastien devaud on par with his much lauded t the controls mix from 2007 scan of the tracklist would suggest that not much has changed between devauds last three mixes: the eclectic selection of a pure audiophile he ranges from the not not fun label overlays of jazz and cushions it all with a sleek underbelly of vocal driven minimal house and detroit techno classics kick off directly with the optimistic splashes of rene l wes but within a matter of seconds it finds new feet with the percussive squals of and the uplifting beach boys meets styled vocals of s is up next and the mix never looks back from there opening sequence introduces the plot a somewhat woozy adventure that feels like a tale of spiritual discovery mood of is always heady but calm searching and experimental without being intellectual generous use of voices from different eras styles and cultures is both humanistic and comforting like listening to a guru or teacher vocalist mimu even intones soul one peace one journey during s remix of as if to make the point clear taken as a tale of discovery there are two telling peaks of enlightenment first is rgys remix of s own breaking which shimmers urgently like an impatient mirage and brings to a close the first run of tracks kid s vocals are affecting and reminiscent of bj rk but perhaps even more so of a female rthur russell who himself makes an appearance on s remix of second peak comes soon after with two remixes of from s recent impermanence album key here is a certain absence of vocals with s sleazy lyrics diminished in the suitably named whisper dub and dio s back to back the two tracks take up a relatively large proportion of the disc and are supplemented by vocals by and more subtle layers of guitar noise from only downside of is arguably the run in to the conclusion two versions of s remix of maurizios domina often clash oscillating between working and not working complicated in particular by the added orchestral layers on the ruff mix arranged by francesco tristano it is eventually the strings and horns that triumph leading to a coda or epilogue of that somehow seems more elegant and peaceful after the temporary maelstrom preceding it indeed as s voice fades into memory the overall sensation of having listened to is of arriving home after a journey feeling cleansed reinforced and refreshed

sydney based group represent a comedic side to the realm of hip hop offering humourous lyrics with clever wordplay combined with tight infectious beats and turntablism the group is fronted by mcs maccy d and breaker j dj diverse on the turntables and production is handled by mez became a household name when they released why do i try so hard - the groups tirade about wannabe american homeboys in sydney now the boys return with their debut album filled with more of that same goofy flavour that weve come to expect club shakers documents maccy and breakers drinking adventures in various establishments (mainly pubs bars rsls) where they partake in games of bingo pool and darts singing karaoke and they drop a cheeky hint of playing on anzac day its alright is a party driven feel good number in a similar vein to the jump up styles of cypress hill and jurassic 5 while diverse cuts up samples to provide the bridge mc maccy d and breaker j drop cheeky references about various types of alcohol - sydneys version of the alkoholics hardcore for sure opens up with the two mcs discussing how everyone thinks theyre soft so they grab the f**kin mic and tell it like it really is its all tongue-in-cheek though - you can sense the satire in their tones and lyrics as they deliver hilariously funny lyrics and clever word associations even mez parodies the production styles of wu-tang clans rza as he drops hard head nodding jazzy beats teeming with deep bass lines and trumpet riffs maccy and breaker provide a link between hip hop and sport if rap was a sport where they take australian sporting names and a few internationals and turn them into clever word associations its something for the sporting fans out there as they drop names from mundine and kostya tzuyu to hopoate and shaquille oneal internal combustion sees the two mcs battle each other cutting each other up with diss rhymes they finally take it too far when they take it out on dj diverse so he cuts them up with a series of turntable disses to which the mcs have no comeback - ouch theres no mistaking the australian flavour permeating through the album - only australians will really get the references dropped in this but after being subjected to american hip hop culture for so long have finally come out and delivered a proper hip hop album which promotes all aspects of australian culture from drinking at the pub to the australian enthusiasm for sport and our tendency to promote ourselves to the rest of the world personally i found the album quite enjoyable especially the hilarious references to australian tv and sport recommended for those who like the beastie boys and ugly duckling
fred peterkin drops the final installment of the codes metaphors samplers following decembers second volume just ahead of the the full album part 3 is again three originals and a remix sends acid-flecked chords over a spacious score of detroit futurism that while falling a little short of peterkins past glories is one of the series strongest moments is instrumentally rich but the yearning vocals give it a cloying feel on the b-side paces a rigid thud through a blur of dulled chimes and pristine kicks before deepblak boss aybee strips-down and de-funks to stirring effect each volume has its moments but overall the codes and metaphors series has fallen short

theres a kind of sexy contrast to the idea of on smallville the hamburg label is known for trim and gently emotive house while stephan laubners style is loose and dirty his records full of grubby kicks sand-paper hi-hats and queasy-sounding melodies together theyve released some of the best music from either camp most notably the near-flawless dub house ep from 2009 laubners new album on smallville mines this common ground more than ever before digging up (between the cd and the lp) seven previously unreleased tracks two old favorites and four loops s promising as that may sound something here falls flat is an artist with a very specific palette but he usually still has a lot of range his albums on something are in turns soothing and dissonant semi-ambient and in their own way ravey ( dark energy something is raw ) meanwhile pretty much stays on one tack the entire time: dusty dub techno with thick drums and muddy basslines there are some great tracks here and melies are both beautifully delicate despite their meaty beats and mbit is laubner at his most mysterious but with such a uniform feel overall its hard to get to the end of this thing without feeling a little restless this is especially true of the cd version when it comes to full-lengths laubner has a format thats always served him well: double-vinyl packs with six or seven new productions plus a batch of locked-groove loops smallville released the album this way but also as an unmixed cd with two old tracks: and the both are great but theyre nearly five years old and they sound a little out of place here they also add another 22 minutes to an album already an hour long still is an artist who sounds inspired even at his most ho-hum with its frosty atmospheres smudged textures and all-important gravelly drums will still do the trick for many of laubners fans (especially the djs) even if it sags as a whole
given that is best known for straight ahead techno on labels such as audio ulture hotflush and well rounded the first release on his label is surprising if only for the remixers involved hris arter jd and factory s nik olk void who presumably adopt the different voices of the eps t s eliot referencing title has plenty going for it theres a hookless verseless structure that wanders prettily and a couple of colourful synth crescendos but sadly the drums are cookie cutter stuff and s post blubstep vocal is forgettable on his eerie slowed down remix hris arter rips out the vocal adds swells of bass and renders the central synth line ghostly and thin drowning everything in a murky reverb and are longer than they ought to be and suffer from tiresome vocal samples on his remix of the latter void wisely loses the vocal introducing a high tension flurry of synth stabs and slabs of distortion jd s remix makes a funky bassline the focal point dabbing on a time stretched vocal and stacking up glassy tinkles mournful strings and foggy claps though deserves credit for stepping outside his comfort zone the originals are clearly overshadowed by the remixes
over the course of the past few years the droog crew has attempted to build a scene around their parties in los angeles its a distinct one something far different than the warehouse vibe enjoyed by droid behavior or the middle ground carved out by robtroniks compression events and its one that many detractors have claimed is all flash little substance whatever your view and most techno fans in los angeles seem to have one its undeniable that droog have built something in the city and its something that has a loosely defined druggy minimal sound attached to it thats the immediate impression you get at least from the debut ep on the crews new imprint which comes courtesy of a collaboration between lee foss and jamie jones foss a man who never met a loose -fitting tanktop he didnt like has been a staple on the la scene and droogs parties for about as long as the group has been around moving to the city after a long stint in chicago jones meanwhile represents the growing ex-pat community in the city he doesnt live there he makes his home in london but plays often enough in the metropolis that he might as well pay rent at damian lazarus place the sound of their debut as i mentioned is psychedelic minimalism the tracks induce the same sort of feeling of vakants finest moments except these arent thicketed forests of sound theyre deserts seems to cut up an 80s classic dismembering its spare percussion and reassembling it into a plodding number that luxuriates in buzzing synths a quick-hitting and never-ending guitar riff and a vocal sample that gets you close to remembering where it all came from meanwhile begins like jones summertime but soon gets caught in a rut substituting an organ lick for forward drive heads is the best thing here as it takes advantage of the fact that it doesnt go anywhere in particular swaying back and forth unsteadily for most of its length somehow pushing forward despite itself via disembodied vocal samples a spectral synth melody and a droning organ
describe as the most punk shit theyve ever released this is no small claim coming from the sometime home of lo percussion and huerco s but its a pretty accurate one the producer is brazils and the tracks strange distorted beats that are house music only in the broadest sense have already seen a cd-r release through his own 40 foda/maneirissimo label the label also hosts habilidosos louche boogie and digi-jazz releases as dj guerrinha; its easy to see why recognised a kindred spirit the title track is the punkier of the two the pots-and-pans percussion might constantly drift out of time but its hard to tell through the distortion the kick drum strays so far into the red that it sounds like somebody booting a paper bag around the studio at the two-minute mark yet more crashing drums and an injection of synth goo bring things to a head but the intensity doesnt last habilidoso cant seem to leave the thing alone constantly adding and subtracting elements to further heighten the chaos agronomia is more tuneful but just as weird its guitar melodies processed into strange warbling loops that play out over a ramshackle beat there are glimpses of a psych-disco anthem in there but theyre just that: glimpses in the delirious torrent of ideas the sheer density of it is exhausting but excellent fun too
fresh from their 1 label 1 mix and 1 artist album rankings in ras 2008 year-end polls will release an album by entitled (guys we like you already: you dont have to stump for more votes ) but before we have well an ep of four tracks three of which have apparently not made it to the full-length and while the contrarian in me desperately wants to tell you how ostgut has lost its way id be lying for those not familiar klock is an ostgut man not a panorama bar denizen that means what we have here is stripped-to-the-bone techno shorn so completely of its emotion that it cant help but ooze it anyway shimmers its way out of the gate with both a beat and melody that shiver its dark and pounding but also slow easing its way through while its synth slices through the murk to become clearer and clearer until it seems as though its about to cut you and then recedes backwards like nothing happened meanwhile lives up to its name and builds a cold groove out of a sibilant cymbal and a kick drum that never lets up heads the flipside and its business as usual but a step above what has come before it five bell notes are all klock needs to induce a trance-like state over a steady kick marking time before the main attraction a fluttering synth blurt shows up is the only track here that is slated to appear on klocks forthcoming album and its an inspired choice for this ep relatively beatless aside from a swishing hi-hat it sounds like a pop ambient audition with more shimmering synths and markus guentner-bells for those wondering what might have in store its a tantalizing glimpse at the sheer breadth of sound that klock is capable of is good but promises to be even better
since the late 2000s has taken a destructive path through electronic music mulching together glitch and ambient pushing digital audio to its limits and reducing trance to its beaming core trance the italian artist has found his muse 2012s quantum jelly was the first major step into the unique sound that has come to define senni and even at the beginning his ideas were clearly outlined on every lengthy slowly unspooling piece only one instrument was used (rolands jp-8000) which was recorded live to two channels without overdubs trance had rarely sounded so austere and certainly never so clinical four years later the only real difference to sennis first record for warp is that the synths sounds are now multi-tracked edited and treated with effects yet those seemingly small changes to the approach have afforded this singular style a wellspring of range and expression syncopated whipcrack rhythms and fizzing supersaw waveforms streaked throughout ricochet between stuttering frenzy and blasts of anthemic hooks before senni breaks the track down to its delirious center and then blows it into towering proportions this all happens within three minutes like a manifesto or a battlecry maximizes sennis so-called pointillistic trance as a diamond-cut alloy of euphoria chugging rhythm harmonic elegance and hyperreal sound design you probably wont hear a better executed synth composition this year re isnt one drum sound used on but for all intents and purposes its an ep of dance music physical percussive and loop-based despite their stark arrangements these six tracks can be more slippery than a sophie single club spectacles rather than bangers songs like and dazzle and confound with their walloping chord stabs popcorn-popping synth tones and comically bright melodies only after digesting them completely might you really be able to dance along with them s penultimate track dials things down is trance as balladry: slow and dreamlike but with the same weight and hyperbolic urgency of everything else that senni can pull off such a balance without losing his core ethos is the mark of an artist at the height of his abilities
plays one of the best live sets in dance music his hands flow across the keyboard as he constructs the meditative and musically accomplished deep house for which hes known his mastery of piano flute and percussion is evident throughout his catalog where youll find joe claussell-indebted spiritual house hi-tech jazz and featherweight folk his virtuosic playing has led to collaborations with the likes of henrik schwarz vakula and dj nature on his latest album he channels a style last seen on a 2013 track with anne clark between shadow and lights where new wave ebm and industrial overlap though 80s synth music can mean different things to different people the cure to a former teenage goth twilight ritual to someone steeped in esoteric minimal synth youd be hard pressed to pick out 80s influences in to figure out where takahashis coming from you need go way back to drp the band he founded with tomoyuki murastige formed at the end of the 80s drp was indebted to ebm the name was short for deutsches reichspatent and they released a full-length on dirk ivens records this conceit results in some of takahashis trackiest material to date as opposed to the free-flowing piano and flute solos that have defined his past work he mostly limits himself to chord-driven atmospheres some direct nods to the era emerge sounds like industrial music as played by john carpenter samples a new wave vocal pitching it up and down until it becomes its own alien lead but takahashis dubby live percussion helps distinguish from its forebears the remaining highlights have little to do with takahashis beloved daf or front 242 amounting to stripped-down takes on his signature sound works a winding bassline and shuffling percussion into excellent off-kilter funk is a rainforest beat track that concludes with paranoid synths takahashi seems uninterested in slavish recreation instead taking subtle production cues from the era nods to his past verge on the imperceptible a gated snare here a roland arpeggio there in a 2013 feature on resident advisor takahashi said : ideas do not run out s 12 tracks running to around 80 minutes demonstrate his sincerity though the album is framed as an oblique homage to 80s darkness kuniyuki uses as a jumping-off point for a sprawling range of styles the unwieldy and sometimes thrilling results sound like no one other than him
for those who worry that the classic strains of detroit techno may be extinguished kirk degiorgio offers up exhibit dds-2 a new ep from 26 year-old londoner toby leeming the producer who goes under the name has put together a three-tracker for the dance music vet that recalls some of the best the motor city has to offer speeding along at a brisk pace but never forgetting that emotion is paramount sounds almost too easy each track perfectly constructed and perfectly tuned for maximum dance floor effectiveness s curling synth riffs are brought to bear via almost industrial rhythms things arent all gloom and doom however as both of the other tunes are on a more uplifting tip is especially glorious wringing all it can out of its lengthy chords while gets to an ecstatic place courtesy of an acid line that bubbles underneath leemings sound palette on is defiantly classic-leaning leaving aside innovation for a narrow craft-orientated focus as such many djs will find that they have tracks that sound mighty similar in their bags already if youre looking for slight variations on tried-and-true formulas however theres few better examples in than this
cassegrain make functional techno with an experimental twist but when the duo are left to their own devices alex tsiridis as rhyw and h seyin evirgen as their music gets even weirder evirgen debuted his solo project last year on ed davenports label with incantations which boasted three spangled peak-time tracks and a dubbier warm-up (or down) track -05 evirgens follow-up and his first solo outing on is subtler and better this ep is all about the details the title track is rubbery and ravey theres not much to it but tracing the morphing blips and buoyant beat is fun is a tease and sounds pretty normal until those odd bass hits get tossed into the mix theres also that soaring sensation that keeps on going after the drop an introverted trip applies pressure from the low-end like the rest of -05 its for sound nerds who like to get down
james greenwood is one of s newer signings but hes closely tied to two of the uk labels biggest stars: erol alkan helped him craft his debut album as and he collaborated with daniel avery on that producers 2013 album drone logic averys textured throb and alkans crossover flair both resonate on channeled through greenwoods reedy voice and synth-pop sensibilities every snare hit writhing bassline and dose of reverb feels purposeful that sheen makes the lp sound generically stylish in its less inspired moments but with its effortless blend of familiar ideas a little bit of post-punk a dash of depeche mode a hint of techno is sleek and modern in a way thats hard to dislike three eps leading up to the album each offered an instrumental track and a vocal cut instrumentals (like red smoke which stole the show on erol alkans recent fabriclive ) were impressive and dynamic while the bite-sized vocal tracks squashed those ideas into radio-ready chunks takes the latter approach presenting a side of greenwood that he hasnt totally mastered yet lets talk about the good parts first: the singles and still sound as smooth as they did last year and ups the ante with quirky percussion and a brighter vocal melody that recalls new order greenwood deftly explores ballads too bringing his voice down to a whisper over more thoughtful productions particularly with its warm hues of 60s psychedelia meanwhile shows some fault lines starting to form clumsily dumping a vocal on top of a rhythm section that sounds like it was stuck together with chewing gum records second half lets loose ditches the hooks for jackhammer repetition colouring its drab foundations with bright streaks of melody really hits pay dirt its the track that best meshes his synth-pop and dance floor styles rinsing out a killer hook before jetting off into a closing section of vigorous arpeggios and hard-hitting woodblocks more distinctive than or the moody crosstown rebels vibes of shows greenwood starting to wring the most out of his influences on the rest of though he still sounds like a fledgling artist its not that greenwood is amateurish (this is a very professional-sounding album) but rather that hes still finding his way around what could be a powerful synth-pop formula is a good record from an artist who is probably capable of a great one
and unknown to the unknown have a lot in common both go about their business reliably never following trends or trying to earn cool points and though are often experimentally minded and unknown to the unknown is a clear-cut dance floor label they both have a sense of humour as such feels like a natural development provide four quirky dance floor cuts that slot right into unknown to the unknowns no-bullshit style if youve ever seen play live hunched over their instruments with their foil hats bobbing up and down you wont be surprised by the zany funk of which sounds a bit like a mangled disco bassline pasted over a casio preset the same goes for with a frazzled kick-snare pattern that feels surprisingly hard to follow and then theres where lay down a percussive workout and then throw a blaring synth note on top an addition that seems like a joke but eventually makes an odd sort of sense only with its electro touches hints at s darker side
this is one amazing record taken from the /tim deluxe underwater sessions volume 1 mix album this is available for a short time only on single-sided blue vinyl almost impossible to categorise this some how manages to combine ambient / broken / acid / progressive / tech / latin house all in one continuous brooding monster that when it really kicks in will simply rip any club to shreds this month s personal dancefloor dynamite no doubt
those of us caught up in the current interface between techno and noise were perhaps expecting to increase or at the very least maintain the level of beat-based experimentation luke younger displayed on his two previous titles for granted neither was overrun with groove yet each featured vital excursions liskojen y off the impossible symmetry lp lurched along with zoviet france-style percussion blown-out for 21st-century ears title track to last years silencer ep meanwhile was a brittle chunk of pagan tribalism that had fonal records written all over it but on the veteran noise-head subverts expectations by excising nearly any trace of rhythm ep opener might be moored to a submerged throb but its a throb that surrenders to manic marimba-like pitter-patter and malfunctioning oscillation screech even more telling are and both of which are marriages of muddied (yet well-layered) electro-acoustics and feedback and negative space drawn from early 90s japanese noise 10-minute title track is younger at his most meticulous by the halfway mark after a thick wave of metallic resonance plateaus his sound collage and artificial field recordings conjure a vision of a rusty freighter swaying on a cold black sea on board is a pooch (one that gives a single sharp yelp) and somebody (younger ) hammering away on a massive pipe organ tune he plays feels awfully lonely
with this promo coming from who has a reputation for making good quality house and breakbeat (also he is a bit of a party monster ) this is evident from kick off a side starts up with a funky 2 step breakbeat working its way through to fat rolling warped bass dropping into dark obscurity clever production and a nice clean mix give this tune a quality feel the flip kicks off with a nice build up spooky synths spiralling in and out then drops into bouncy bass line for the crowd gradually drops to drum and bass line a roller which combines meaty beats with a simple yet effective groove s this as you would expect from is quality
newcomer on his website states that his series of white labels aims to make subs rattle and be a convoluted mess of dubstep 3-step post minimal wankstep shithouse acid wonk well then it seems that by disregarding conventions in a big way hes got everyone very excited indeed on the back of a single 12-inch hes managed to get bookings right alongside the likes of loefah and peverelist and have even more key players singing his praises nyone of course has the potential to do his or her own thing but its the way he does it thats important; theres a deceptive amount of control if you look closely enough ased around raw machine drums hes so off the beat it makes you wince in sympathy for the circuits crucially though the seams never quite split takes a while to come in idling its time around a 2-step slanted straight beat with twitters and shrieks punctuating things wildly its fiercely heavy raw techno shot through with insane melodies the drums boom and reverb is liberally applied with a sense of open space throughout applies this to familiar dubstep/future garage effect although the magnitude of it and the feel are more remarkable like its both challenging and slamming: a wicked combination
somewhere between footwork and baile funk lies who hails from the unlikely location of denver colorado a place that has little to do with either genre that said chap is a member of the teklife crew even if teklife is based in chicago their affiliates are now spread all over the world an indication of their influence with a title like chap gives us an indication of what to expect from his ep what he delivers is no-frills and stripped-down but this isnt a mere sample pack its more akin to a hip-hop breaks or battle record but these tracks arent so simplistic they can be enjoyed uninterrupted on loop and are perfectly functional as dj tools each of the three tracks contain only drums and brief vocal samples that sound like favela party exaltations essa and throw in a few synth stabs maybe even a full vocal phrase if that doesnt sound like much (the five cuts come to a grand total of ten minutes so in a sense it isnt) the impact of so few elements hits hard both footwork and baile are exuberant party styles and mixing the two together is a natural fit that no one else has claimed it feels funky fresh
on this 1 sided promo goes solo with this moody 12 entitled numb it begins with rattling effects and not a beat in sight for the first few minutes a solid kick comes in and then the hats follow the kick hats and effects merge beautifully to make a great early set tune a slow stabbing synth comes in deep into the track but overall this works very well as an opening record as proven by kasey taylor recently in his sydney gig a great solo effort from stephane proving he can do the business without often partner in crime john creamer due to hit stores early with a meat katie remix which didnt appear on the promo unfortunately
a joint project by and regis first surfaced in 2009 with map output - 1/2 presented a more spacious and less frenzied sound than previous showings yet one that remained grounded in raw industrialism and throwback purism ir most recent release largely sees that aesthetic continue over three tracks each with its own distinct vision cross the eps first two tracks rch and a and a youll find no contrived white noise or breakdowns loops that drag on for that little bit too long or even dj-friendly intros and outros instead mutilated yet strangely melodic synths and hammering war drums entwine to great effect across both efforts making each a handy weapon for the adventurous selector to closes things out with a flurry of shifting rhythms and sinister vocals its the most retro sounding thing on offer here the only one not destined for regular club play thanks to its largely frantic intensity and a commendable companion to its more floor-friendly counterparts
after putting it all on the table on glass eights his peerless 2010 full-length more or less stopped releasing music: besides a handful of remixes the last few years have been bereft of his painstakingly arranged and devastatingly gorgeous compositions though he was sorely missed his absence may ultimately have been for the best: the hype surrounding the new yorker-turned-berliner truly distracted from the fact that he was as good as everyone said he was now that the bubble hasnt so much burst as deflated with grace roberts can get back to making beautiful music and thats precisely what we get with the low-key a simultaneous distillation and reinvention of roberts rich atmospherics that might not have been possible immediately after glass eights with the ep opens as if roberts has just awoken from an impossibly long sleep: its tumbling pitched drums can hardly carry a rhythm and woozily intertwined cello and piano have to seemingly pull themselves out of dissonance the title cut finds roberts once again on even-footing but s music-box stomp more mount kimbie than modern house feels worlds removed from the straightforwardly danceable vein hes known for after sifting through strange chords on an old piano on roberts slips into a 4/4 beat on but thump aside theres very little party to be found in its woody drone and twinkling high-end doesnt sound like the you remember so much as feel like that music did its a shiver youll be happy to have running down your spine again
okotek memnon and seroya ives are just a few of the guises of who is starting to make some lasting impressions with his quality production work holmes was given a great opportunity this year to lay down a remix kot s i want you (for myself) and in turn have given him the chance to shine the ritual dub provides a brilliant tribal almost religious trek through pure house music an array of drums and percussion gel nicely together with the distorted vocals and following the break funky bassline hooks are added to great effect the divine creation mix would shine through on any rainy day with its warmth and minimal sounds tearful synths low beats smooth melodies and swirling vocals create a setting for this seriously groovy houser

jsm is a new label project from saele valese a low-key berlin-based artist who draws inspiration from the works of the american photographer francesca woodman its first record comes from valese by way of the alias and was initially snuck out through hard wax back in november before this wider release offers two compelling unfussy cuts of droning introspective techno both untitled that approach sound and sequencing in a similar way youll find syncopated kicks and a sliver of hi-hat in each along with a heady mixture of long tones random ticks and thick reverb it all feels uncomplicated and its careful sense of restraint stands out the a-side is a melancholy effort thanks to some gently descending minor-key synths the b-side is a little more expansive and its tambura-like tones are perfect for zoned-out situations valese plans to grow jsm slowly with releases from a couple other artists later in the year but for now is a promising start
danny buddah morales follows the double pack release from pier pressure on this new york based label with rooster sammy are back on remix duties as they turn in yet another deep chunky house affair with twists and turns throughout thanks to some quirky cheeky synths and smooth vocals quirky effects do good things for this pretty solid remix yet again from this dynamic duo buddah s main mix for me doesn t possess the energy and creativity the a-side had in abundance more tribal business here that really doesn t do enough to warrant the track of the release that s left to the pretty impressive a-side that saves this release
the new lp from berlin upstart hearkens back to an era when the album served the fundamental statement of a musicians aesthetic this is in no small part due to the young producers diverse ear graef has been making waves in the underground house world but as he recently told ras will lynch he spends most of his money on old records he cant play in clubs rivers meanwhile was originally conceived as an instrumental hip-hop album it has a loose smoky feel that owes as much to beatmakers like madlib or j dilla as it does to any house producer a casual synthesis of dusty jazz hip-hop and house rivers speaks to graefs formidable talent album opens with a lead thats in turns menacing and comical vibrant synth flanked by saxaphone introduces graef as our fearless guide unbound by genre orthodoxy like a good writer graef varies the length of his statements dance floor tracks like a previously released jan hammer-style burner stretch out over six-minutes cheekily titled by contrast is a rhodes-driven jazz vamp that fades out almost as soon as it begins graefs omnivorous ear and precocious youth allow him to fly without a net pulling off risky musically ambitious arrangements most significantly he ditches the samples that drove his early records opting instead for heady instrumentals that echo proggy 70s soundtracks or jazz classics like herbie hancocks chameleon one of the albums highlights has a jogging bassline that calls to mind the nostalgic dance sound mastered by andr s wayne snow adds his tender vocals to and the result sounds like james blake with a fetish for boom bap percussion in yet another nod to golden era hip-hop rivers shorter sketches often include a dry institutional voice didactically pointing out the properties of the various drums and synthesizers graef isnt interested in melting your face with peak-time club tracks instead he takes playful trips away from the dance floor to keep the listener and himself interested this is serious music that refuses to take itself too seriously
brussels based djs kong and gratts inaugurated their label late last year with xosars retreat 2 rapture san sodas remix on that package was billed as a one time only outing for his xan xoda alias but the name pops up again on the labels second release as he teams up with gratts as their track is called a belgian phrase that apparently means hot air which is about right for this weightless three way confection of gently crunchy bass soft pads and bongos australian producer ben suns remix is billed as his interpretation and his if it aint broke dont fix it quote in the press sheet rings true his version is little more than some light sanding down of a few edges belgian dj eklektiker is a resident at kong and gratts basement party and he contributes the other original on this package under the name is relaxed shimmering fare with tropical percussion gently thwacking away as a pretty synth melody flutters in the foreground londons sisterhood close the package with their interpretation of by far the most floor ready thing here it kicks stealthily forward via delicious rolling bass humming pads and glowing high notes ending things on a relatively energetic high
well its formulaic tech house read one comment the last time i reviewed something on this spanish label nd he was right until now half peruvian half italian and berlin-based is the first man to break the mould for the barcelona label turning in a massive curveball in the form of la a nine minute organic percussive opus at the heart of his label debut weaving together finger clicks congas heavy-hearted chords and solemn strings the thing twists and turns through various melancholic moments without so much as a single kick for company it does have some nice moments but frankly is a much more appealing prospect in the hands of british orchestral musician joash his remix is much fuller but equally organic with plucked bass and swinging claps veering into extra jazzy territory its suspenseful without feeling cluttered and come the end really sounds like some deep house-loving philharmonic group jamming in a basement: impressive stuff elsewhere x-press turn in a super lively and classy fairground house interpretation with myriad rhythmic lines wiggling in its wake before also contributing a tougher more stripped back beats version of their own remix patinos other original effort is not that standard either: clipped and bobbling beats fall over themselves in their surge forward beneath lingering organ notes and a refreshing neo-soul vocal its fluid warm and likeable confirming the ep to be more worthy of your ear than you might expect
as neither member of paris-based franco-argentine electronica duo fritz lang are called fritz or indeed lang it suggests they are film buffs naming themselves after the great german auteur theres certainly a widescreen approach: s headline features are its meowing synth bass stabs ice-crisp drum programming and languid vocal its perhaps too semi-reclined for anything more than a warm-up set but theres talent at work here the flip believe is an electro-samba jam session which doesnt quite live up to the presence of the lead track le s take on is yet another impressive notch on his bedpost with definite echoes of pepe bradock at work in its restrained jazz inflections chocolate-rich pads and hypnotic pace another frenchman ben reworks by stripping away much of the originals nuances to leave a driving groove with trippy bolt-ons befitting a producer who has recently hooked up with juan atkins metroplex imprint
severed heads were a rotating cast of misfits that emerged from suburban sydney in the late 70s with as their ringleader ir early music harsh pretty deeply odd provides a glimpse into an australian experimental scene that moved in parallel to the dominant narratives of the late 70s and early 80s ellards use of tape loops in particular foresaw the wave of sample-based music that was to follow as the 80s rolled into the 90s he was and remains an avant-garde larrikin the kind of guy who made music with watermelons and cooked vinyl over an electric stove severed heads catalogue is strewn with half-forgotten tapes and records all of which is catnip to reissue labels vinyl-on-demands 2008 box set remains the most thorough severed heads retrospective to date but this year saw medical records and get in on the action medical reissued two lps from the mid-80s since accident and city slab horror while put out an extended version of the bands best-known song dead eyes opened ellard himself remains wary about such revivalism: people will be bitching about limited editions at my funeral he said on twitter recently is behind this latest release lp a collection of ellards solo recordings that originally appeared on two cassettes: and snappy carrion both of which came out on ellards own terse tapes label in 19 though the music has long been available digitally via bandcamp the tapes were hard to track down and the music had never been pressed to wax of all the severed heads-related reissues that have surfaced in lp is the most adventurous each track is glued together by warped tape loops samples taken from radio and tv scrambled electronic signals and primitive drum rhythms ever the tinkerer ellard used this reissue as an opportunity to remaster the original material and finish off previously unheard sketches from early 80s res a crunchy sweetness to whose timeless qualities were recently demonstrated by joy orbison on his essential mix song title is a reminder that ellard was using a roland tb-303 bassline in 19 putting on him on par with charanjit singh as an acid house precursor i havent been able to shake the vocal on spoken by an unidentified woman in a soporific voice a testament to ellards knack for sampling same machinery is used to toy with ebm ( ) industrial noise ( ) and ritualistic drum tracks ( ) strangeness always attracts others ellard said in an ra exchange last year hes right music on lp may be 32 years old but its magnetic pull feels as strong as ever
solid groove aka switch releases his first mix album and the clue is in the name these house beats are no nonsense and straight down to business opening with his own cracking remix of blaze s do you remember he hits a funky groove early on with the bassline on induceve s get some groove as switch get on downz is a deep deep vibe-led track that s been ripping up faith dancefloors then nathan drew larsen twists the electro blade just a little more in a minimal track there s a pause for breath with the stop-start pain from stefan goldmann the riff complemented by kristiina tuomi s vocal this leads into the blaze classic my beat give yet another remix by solid groove surely one of the most frequently remixed tracks of recent years a balearic flavour is noticeable throughout induceve s second track issamippi before some twisted fragmented vocal tracks bring the mix to a close a nice keyboard loop dominating the final solid groover last orders a decent debut well mixed and with no pretensions perhaps just lacking that extra wow factor to propel it into the big league but solid nonetheless
first time i saw rous ndy gardner together as a duo was in january 001 at fabric t the time the lads known as the s were relatively unknown outside of london it was glaringly obvious though that this would not be the case for much longer as they both had the dark gloomy room at fabric in a frenzy what really impressed me then was their ability to keep the tempo of their performance at epic heights for an extended amount of time is no doubt a key to their amazing success they have experienced during their career years on sony playstation soundtracks levi commercials sky sports appearances behind them i was interested to hear this fabriclive 08 mix to see if they still have that element of madness they readily possessed on that cold windy night on saturday 13th january 001 screechy intro is very indicative of the s live performance as are the baselines of nova by up front s very own squeaks leeps is pretty much self explanatory while contact by the s again is another impressive production by the duo using a deeper approach then the previously mentioned track s cakehole is undeniably a highlight with its effects deep baseline of the first half of the mix which has a smooth flow without hitting any real peaks two on a by takes the mix into the first peak a nice piano line mixed with fast furious beats rock by has a killer electro baseline swirling effects making it a definite climax of the mix we move to a funky electro heaven with the s mix of s electric ppliances while the stab mix of hey by two has an early 0 s italian house feel to it a sure record to bring the smile out in anyone mix then ends on an all time high with the very classic patrick cowley mix of s classic i love fans should know what to expect from the s in this instance the latest fabric live instalment doesnt disappoint 0 tracks in fewer than 70 minutes with the energetic mixing track selection you have come to expect from the two this is as close as i can describe this cd in a sentence enjoy
is the most versatile producer on the labels other core members abdulla rashim varg korridor deal almost exclusively in blackened melancholy be it with gloomy deep techno morose ambient or angsty industrial but you never know what youre going to get with whose catalogue spans galloping peak-time techno to balmy head nodders june his album from last year was a modern techno gem the work of a multifaceted producer given room to stretch out he limits his scope on his second solo 12-inch since june but still finds ample range in a relatively limited framework this is good news for djs who get four cuts for different parts of a night many will be drawn to a track that recalls mike parkers wormhole techno but is more jacking the rest of is more subdued though no less powerful and which could be an offcut from june are at house tempos and should appeal to the styles more adventurous selectors only is particularly abrasive making it a little out of place next to the delicate efforts that said it wouldnt be an record without a curveball
initially rising to prominence via his 2008 cut-up disco revivalist smash sexvibe its funny to think that s latest offering was recorded in the same year the track has a wonderful subaquatic throb and wouldnt sound out of place in a darkened warehouse its expertly layered and maintains a level of restraint throughout jackmate strips the track down but ups the urgency is reminiscent of a west coast house jam from around ten years ago something summery and groovy which could have come out on seasons recordings it has a bouncy vibe and its jazzy hook has an air of familiarity but still sounds fresh violas remix of is perhaps the most idiosyncratic offering here the vocal holds its own but jostles for position with the sampled acoustic guitar which recalls but doesnt imitate the well-worn prescription every night riff
with josiah wises voice and songwriting would have been memorable no matter who produced it this much was clear when he performed with only a grand piano at the release show for his debut ep last week the song is mostly just wises tragic tender voice wilting over a few piano chords and he carried the unplugged version easily the involvement of british producer the haxan cloak however is what takes to the next level is devastating enough with the heartbreaking lyrics about lost love but bobby krlics mournful synths and earth-shaking sub-bass make the feeling that much more physical their darkness pairs perfectly wise sings of shame desperation and loss his weightless voice winding up and down in gospel spirals im fine with you being a liar he coos to an imaginary lover on the eps peak emotional moment im fine with you being a killer im fine with you being suicidal no that shit dont bother me none where wise draws our eyes to a dark side of humanity krlics sound design suggests a similar kind of abyss one thats impossible to look away from wise is classically trained and foregrounds his orchestral inclinations the violins french horns and timpani evoke operatic levels of drama especially with krlics giant noise crescendos that punctuate the story unites the powers of spirituality and sex wise grew up in a god-fearing family regularly attending a pentecostal church and gospel forms the backbone of this record but it also oozes sex not just because of suggestive lyrics but because of wises voice which seems to shake and sweat with carnal desire he makes spirituality and sex feel mutually reenforcing rather than contradictory (its been suggested that posits sex as an act of faith) the title track in particular captures that feeling with celestial harps and a deep terrestrial bass that sneaks up quietly its an unusual pairing much like wise and krlic and it forms the tension behind a remarkably evocative record
this limited edition press featuring two stand out tracks from (aka mark wheawill) have recently gone into circulation last year ra reviewed mark s debut album which featured a distinct array of tracks reaching many different genres here mark has opted to remix one of the best tracks of that album chemistry plus adds a nice production called blinded by the sun the chemistry club mix is a big slice of old school synth action tied in with a gorgeous melodic main stay that has the lips whistling along continuously the mix starts off slow with rolling and sustained sounds alongside an effected bass and melody as the build finishes the tracks gets sucked into the main melody along with the old school hooks as the simple beats and percussion float along smoothly the breakdown gets its own special treatment with nice pads and xylophone samples which add more depth as they are mixed together with the other melodies as i had said before mark s skills with melody are always infectious and remain the attraction here excellent tune blinded by the sun (ode to bt) is more a journey into sounds and samples with animal noises and atmospherics teamed up with rolling synths and light melodies the long build at the start gives the track a good start and when the mix kicks in the rolling and gritty synths come to the forefront with smooth beats and the remaining animal samples lots of nice little melodies can be heard throughout in the background or out on their own and add nice depth to the mix two solid original tracks here from showcasing great productions especially in the melodic area if you like your music uplifting this is for you

i remember at last year s sonar by there were three distinct crowds in the techno room it was sweaty and wild eyed outside at the d banger stage it was pretty girls and well groomed boys in bright colours waving their cameraphones in the air like they just didn t care and at the dubstep stage it was student y boys in muddy brown clothing ostentatiously smoking spliffs and trying to skank moodily and this is what i ultimately find funny and ridiculous about dubstep there s a massive gulf between the image of the scene and the people who actually listen to it lets be honest there s very little that s urban or dangerous about dubstep now that it s gone global it s basically idm for the facebook generation but pretensions aside we all need to be grateful that dubstep exists because it s pretty much the only scene around that isn t some sort of revival or tribute to something else (yes you could argue that dubstep is a tribute to digi dub etc but please really ) so dubstep is a new idea and that s great but you also need to be able to dance to music a couple years back when dirgelike loefah halfstep tunes and meditations on bass weight ruled the roost actually getting down and doing a jig to this stuff was well nigh impossible of course the word on the internets was you have to hear it at fwd to really understand but that didn t help the rest of us much things have moved on since then partly due to djs like n type championing a more up front style and now in (co author of last year s anthem ) has dropped what s probably the full on danciest dubstep record yet with but in a move that probably appalls a lot of hardcore dubstep fans this is not dancey in a skanking reggae manner it s dancey in a fist pumping techno manner to make a lazy analogy is the d rush of dubstep key features of this album are: 1) pounding kick drums trips has a kick kick kick snare pattern that s only a whisker away from being a full on 4/4 thump 2) harsh speedy hoover noises uses synths that would make joey beltram and marc acardipane poo their pants ) melodies you all know the one from (although whether two notes counts as a melody might be debatable) and bulb uses a similar device re are even housey chords on motions 4) jacking basslines i just invented this term but that s what they are re s none of the kind of meandering all surrounding sub bass that you sit back in like a giant sonic beanbag instead tunes like have stuttering aggressive basslines with lots of midrange that invite jerky hard dancing what does that add up to heads down one arm in the air bouncing on one leg and calling for a rewind in all probability album bursts with energy and is forceful from beginning to end all the tracks have solid chunky grooves and the only real misstep is where a hip hop beat and a your love style synth combine to make something excruciatingly sludgy and dated sounding my favourite moments on the album are actually the two mellowest tracks and the where uses more organic sounds and a bit of live bass to create an almost broken beat vibe before the real heavy bass drops on it s own terms is a tour de force this will really move feet and fists and reach out to new audiences for dubstep yet to my ears the word for this album is effective rather than delightful you can t submerge yourself in s music the way you can with burial or dmz it just lacks rhythmic complexity of the latter and the emotion of the former relentless testosterone addled toughness grates terribly after a while too and a few of the sci fi sounding samples are definitely the wrong side of the cheese line you could never expect dubstep to stand still and there s no knowing where it ll go next but as an evolution of the sound represents a trade off re s a lot more energy and a groove that s defined enough for large audiences to dance to but in exchange the sense of space and depth and a lot of the genre s potential warmth and sexiness have been sacrificed there s more step but less dub in other words d rush is a lazy comparison but still a relevant one much as the techstep sound opened up jungle to pilled up ravers worldwide but lost it the support of its original fanbase has probably alienated much of the fwd crew with this but will have gained fans worldwide overall you need to at least give this a listen because it s definitely new and it s definitely relevant at least to anyone not deeply immersed in the dubstep scene it s great to see this music continually changing and who knows maybe the dubstep room will become the sweaty wild eyed one this year
few upcoming producers have as high a strike rate as the belgian artists time 2 express label might as well come with a buy on sight sticker and his releases for lan have been of a consistently high standard whats most impressive about his music is his ability to sound utterly distinctive and forward thinking while using what sounds like just a few elements sure there have been comparisons to the berghain sound the residents regularly chart his work and norman nodge even delivered a superb remix of van hoesen last year but in understanding and appreciating his work it would be as instructive to point to peters sound design work for theatre and mixed media as well as his deep understanding of technos past theorising aside builds on all of these influences and even makes a nod to the dubstep shuffle a moody bass that seems to constantly ebb and flow sometimes more intense often less so is joined by skipping percussion and a fragile melody that remains in the background throughout below 30 is straighter and more focused on techno functionality but here too van hoesens rumbling bass keeps changing fluid but always visceral mlz provides the remix of and decides to go for the jugular while it could be argued that it loses some of the originals subtle nuances the truth is that the spiralling filters jack-knifing hi-hats and evil acid sequence augment the original production is more proof that is van hoesens for the taking
t might not always be clear to those living outside of north merica but since its inception in the mid 80s the miami winter music conference has despite the apparent commercialism and frivolousness surrounding it created a sense of community between djs producers promoters and record labels who live continents apart has often stressed the conferences importance to him especially since it allowed him to escape montreals closely knitted community enter international networks that went beyond canadas early rave scene and develop working relationships that are still going strong today n that sense its not really a surprise to see turbo s label paying homage to the floridian mecca with a compilation unambiguously titled apparently first met finnish producer who worked on his cover of sunglasses at night at wmc the duos latest creation and one of this compilations exclusive tracks proves their relationship is still a fruitful one elsewhere the kind of techno the label has championed over the last 18 months is surprisingly under represented turbo seem to be opting instead for something more suited to sunny terraces and beach parties like the quirky house of s or the sleazy disco of n s remix of the recent single the mood gets slightly more forbidding thanks to who delivers and teams up with on the albums closer a similarly martial exercise in sub aquatic bass and sharp synthetic pads next to this newer crop of producers a veteran like disappoints a little his austere sounding anemic compared to what comes next: verl a bouncy slice of warehouse techno s is a peculiar inclusion especially in the way its siren like motif recalls electro houses most annoying and populist moments but the collections credibility is restored by dj s muscular remix of s and ron s lightly acidic n the end is similar to wmc itself: unchallenging but with peppered with interesting discoveries
his interview with resident dvisor jacob martin said he was someone who liked to make an entrance a musical sense his exuberant personality often shines through mor fati from a 2014 dnuos ytivil 12-inch would be the life of any party and the central riff on burned to memory from last years berceuse heroique 12-inch had an outsized swagger on he pulls back on cocksure gestures hes not showing a softer side necessarily but the music is more reserved than usual title track works its magic slowly for the first four minutes keyboards prod and acoustic plucks circle in tight formation when the first kick drum lands after more than four minutes the track stays steady theres no cliff-edge breakdown no sudden left turn but martin uses clever details including sudden pitch shifts spinbacks (especially effective when he phases the strings) and crunchy gunshot samples and a pair of ambient tracks further pare down martins sound former is the more contemplative of the two and has an eerie stillness generous reverb on the chimes and choral notes evokes a cathedral suggests a sense of peace too though not at first its arpeggiated lead commands the opening minutes before martin soothes the musics urgency with warm and comforting bass notes even when creating restful moods his music is exciting

tin man and jtc s releases on records suggested a state where one more cup of coffee would vault those behind the hardware from comfortably caffeinated to hyperactive the newest offering the debut 12-inch by los angeles-based fully commits to the belching smokestack imagery of his name a trio of remixes includes a fantastic acid house party-starter from atom b o y centres around a magnetic synth line thats shackled to a synth pop kick-snare despite some whimsical flourishes its the most utilitarian of the four tracks dj stingray adds incidental grumblings of the factory workers as the main melody is mixed up in excess dust and metallic particles auxons remix is ornate but sacrifices the bass progression while a dayglo rave piano thumps in search of a foundation the clear winner comes from atom who throws kinks into the assembly line with a ramshackle un-quantized drum pattern the organic percussion is contrasted with the gaudy futurism of acid swells its totally raucous wiping away the dust of the other remixes and making for a wonderfully heady display of peak-time playfulness
though s immensely important tectonic label helped to define last decades dance music landscape some of its founders most trailblazing work was released on other labels to wit take on punch drunk or punisher on planet mu even if our collective selective memory might allocate them to tectonic mia is a compilation that collects the bristol producers work for other imprints from 2006 2010 one that incidentally also serves to remind what an innovator rob ellis was during dubsteps underground years like any such collection theres not much rhyme or reason behind the tracklisting aside from the roughly chronological order what does render the compilation somewhat coherent is its most obvious factor: a master producer he possesses a gift for percussion some of the heaviest but also most nimble in the dubstep sphere a skill which allowed him to create both tracks like the stirring (here in its form) and the frantic of the no matter what hes experimenting with it always sounds like him one or two extra drums squeezed into each bar or at least it feels that way lp contains a few surprises including excellent remixes of and the latter of which is a wonderfully restrained 115 bpm crawl underlining the unusual meditativeness of ellis steadily repetitive rhythms re are other tracks that are forgotten gems in the catalogue like the atmospheric lurch of dream even better tucked away on track 99 is reportedly s first ever dubstep production its a hesitant track that lacks some of the detail of his later work but still sounds recognizable with its slow burn chord progression a neat little look at his origins mia suffers from a few baffling omissions 2010s croydon house an early defining release for swamp81 was a more recent highlight for ellis and one that signaled he could do more than just traditional dubstep but instead of the flagship cut we get its (still solid) flipside this compilation also presented an opportunity to shed light on even more lesser known material such as his work with pavel ambiont it may have been better served by simply collecting every track that had released on other labels into a bigger package; after all its not as if a second disc would have interrupted any cohesion but those are rather privileged complaints for a disc that rounds up some hard to find or out of print rarities and puts them in one simple digitally available package its one of those things that you dont really know you need until you have it; and though youll still have to go hunting for old punch drunk and swamp81 to really get the best of ellis career this isnt a bad place to start mia is a perfectly decent way to re investigate the history of one of dubsteps originators and likely discover some new favourites in the process
jimpsters has had a busy year or so releasing a string of beautiful deep house cuts with beautifully emotive sounds ranging from the lush melodicism of kyodais mi rhumba to the funky strut of andre croms tell me the london labels latest the / ep keeps that trend (which truthfully dates back to freeranges beginnings in the late 90s) intact produced by the wazi wazi labels the ep is framed as an ode to the germans producers two home-base cities though he must know something about that we dont as weve never thought the town as a hotbed of stripped-down spine-tingling beauty ut thats exactly what the eps supplies via its simple rhythmic template undulating bass tone shimmering vocal sample and dreamy keys all sitting beneath a quivering string pad its a hypnotic groover that conjures an almost imperceptible tautness one thats only broken by a buzzing minor-key synth line that adds a hefty slab of meat to the cuts bones at the midway point the tracks no lies ad infinitum remix from chicago phenom savile manages a neat trick: using the originals elements its as laidback and delicate as the original yet its imbued with a sense of foreboding thanks to a tough dj pierre-style kick pattern subtle effects and a slow-burn build that amps up the originals tension finally theres which utilizes much the same elements as (vocal snippet heavenly strings muted keys) but trades its plaintive aura in for a lightly boogie-fied feel largely through the addition of a disco-funky synth-bass its the capper to a great year for freerange and bodes well for the burgeoning career of the talented penner

is the 20-year-old wunderkind hugely responsible for dubstep s blow-up in the last year his debut lp was a potent mix of sinister basslines and laid-back dub vocals with jazzy two-step and straight-out grime on the bill as well fans of that album are in for a bit of a surprise with his latest as he s done away with the playful chilled-out vibe that criss-crossed in favor of far darker sounds is less opener more peaktime material: relentlessly steady bass syncopated drums and star wars laser sound effects collide on a tempo that s far faster than usual for dubstep much like his first hit midnight request line lose is dubstep through-and-through but with definite crossover appeal for bold js the same can t be said for the ep s other two originals boxin and both of which are unapologetically wicked boxin strikes a nice balance between high-end creepiness and low-end wobble and would complement a scene from one of those torture porn horror movies quite nicely is decent dancefloor darkness with the bass plunging further and further down the scale while a female vocal moans me daaaaance make me hot ut with a yawner of a breakdown and six-minute running time goes limp long before it s over unmemorable holdover heck featuring queen on vocals finishes things out fans are sure to dig the lose track and boxin would make for solid ammunition if you re ever spinning a vampire club night and heck on the other hand are little more than filler
its an artist-label combination that seems like buy-on-sight material often known as miss fitz s style is trim sexy and deep but also a bit twisted and drugged out in other words exceptionally compatible with s signature sound ut somehow this particular pairing of artist and label almost feels like too close of a match; dont know doesnt reveal anything new about either party that said nidams prodding rhythms and tinge of surrealism make this 12-inch a very funky and effective dance record that certainly doesnt disappoint oth tracks have fairly similar arrangements consisting mostly of dry percussion warped vocal hooks and jagged bass-heavy rhythms the title track stumbles along with a rigid lumbering gait while woozy vocals slur and moan and major piano chords provide warm splashes of color is a bit more of a ketamine jam less melodic more trippy and drab the -sides vocal part is reprised joined by panning warbles tambourines and a floppy electric bass recorded so clearly you can hear the action buzz this is the eps stronger track (by a hair) but it needs a decent sound system to really prove itself otherwise it might just sound like basic clumpy minimal s with the record in general its neither nidams nor s most memorable effort but its still weird and punchy enough for the discerning djs crate
since klockworks released an ep in 2013 the ukrainian producer has steadily risen through s ranks hes become a regular at berghain and frequently plays alongside the clubs residents at parties around europe last year he released on s sub-label unterton but is his first record on proper its easy to see why kyle became so popular he has a subtle but striking style that recalls sandwell district defined by negative space and carefully eqd percussion might be kyles most prominent release but its also among his most understated three of the four tracks have long beatless intros while any big-room touches like parts of the luke slater-esque banger flicker rather than dominate using bright and hopeful sounds like the brian eno-style melodies on or the spaced-out detroit worship of he makes straightforward techno feel alluring in particular is full of stunning spacial details that are easy to get lost in feels like technos equivalent of a major label debut taking what made kyles earlier work stand out and giving it a polish
s who s fraid of may have only come home with the bronze in r s top tracks of but it will surely go down as the year s biggest tune when edms history books are written no wonder then that it s now on its fourth and fifth official remixes courtesy of breaks bigwigs stanton and house hotshot paul following a trifecta from merican techno s past present and future kevin saunderson udion and tanner ross gets a major fish-out-of-water rework in its first trip overseas stanton roll up their sleeves and gut it like a rusty old uick installing some v8 breaks and a flamed-up electro paintjob much like the mental picture this evokes the remix is unimaginative and a bit cheesy little more than the breaks version of vonstroke s original the breakbeat is rad though; ultra punchy and begging for a vocal acapella to really sail home come on vonstroke s laptop jockey neighbors the best mashups in the world ever are from san francisco right get on it paul takes the same blueprint but hilariously reads it upside-down scratching his head and crossing his eyes clocking in at just over twelve minutes s remix has more in common with pink floyd s on the run than vonstroke s original there are a few bleeps from the memorable first break in scattered haphazardly throughout but for the most part mr seems interested in taking it further down the rabbit hole for three-quarters of the way its a near-relentless low-frequency synth wave inexplicably ending on big uplifting yanni: live at the cropolis synths this ones strictly for the no one s listening warm-up set and fans of the original would do best to shy away ut fans of pot and the visualizer feature on your computer s music player would do best to kill the lights crank the sub take a hit and strap in
the title seems like sly self-deprecation referencing the rigid tunnel vision of contemporary techno of producers like ironically is actually one of the loosest tracks ive heard from the london producer but of course its all relative this is still heavy industrial-strength stuff the kick threatens to slip off the rails the violent and punishing chords tear audible holes into the tracks fabric and the hats are reduced to slurred bolts of jagged electricity the whole thing can barely contain itself and the feeling of freewheeling abandon is thrilling in the context of a style that usually sounds like its methodically plowing through subterranean passages unfortunately could also easily be the work of several other like-minded producers in fact its all very surgeon especially the pockets of sumptuous reverb that periodically bubble up; and while its a good impression it feels derivative nonetheless its that elevates the release skidding dangerously as a lovably frantic cowbell saturates every iota of empty space between the kicks the unexpected breakdown drops the bottom out for tense panting and horror-film pads and the sudden interjection of human sounds into s factory-powered beats is initially jarring of course its paranoid and soaked with perspiration in other words it fits right in one things for sure: s unfailingly high production values make up for the occasionally impersonal functionalism

is a record that can be judged by its cover: this one with its artisan florals will be beautiful the record comes from japanese producer who you might know from his mister saturday night release people are changing the tracks all recorded last year are rammed to the edge with sound they are filled with odd percussive flurries (a telling title: drummer trix ) overall this results in a zany brand of house and techno but sanos not so easily boxed in the first track is a stunning hook woeful croons and sparkly flutters create a busy but serene environment like the insides of a butterfly farm things stay charming on with its starlit keys and noodley brass the is the records functional burner: slick breaks punchy drums and blown out piano are packed together finally and parades by with spurts of saxophone and african chants with people are changing sano showed off his crushing side here he proves he can be colorful as well
its been two years since aquarian released his last record a striking self-titled ep for uno so this two-tracker is cause to salivate well that and the two accompanying recipes (for braised pork shoulder and udon with bacon and kimchi) marks a new era for the new york producer inaugurating his label is aquarian at his best: searing club melodrama built from whip-crack breaks ground-splitting bass and acrid techno adornments its made to tear a dance floor apart and comes with extra fervour thanks to its rave horns and grim demeanour is another weapon the grotty bass kind it sounds like a long-lost uk dub with swampy bristol atmospherics and london grime fx but the drop takes things into an ominous headspace thats harder to pin down such subtle inversions are what make aquarian records stand apart from the rest of the breakbeat techno bangers out there
the next release on the always consistent imprint comes from latvian born producer and dj has been getting great airplay from desyn masiello for the last half year not just the original but also the uplifting david ferrero mix on the flip the original mix on the a-side is a great summer house anthem it s smooth and quite simple in its approach with some delightful piano riffs and drum patterns making it a great outdoor summer style production david ferreros park remix has a slightly tougher feel thanks to a more upbeat approach the great piano elements from the original survive intact but ferrero adds a stunning melodic breakdown midway into the track and nice deep driving basslines all in all it s another very good release from and one that will appeal to those who love their house music smooth and melodic
one of the great things about going to a club is hearing how certain tracks are supposed to sound subtle sounding tunes you might have previously considered mellow warm up tracks turn into bombs while cuts that seemed in your face at home may offer little in the way of surprises theres something special about the first kind case in point: hello s the eight minute a side of playground vol 1 the first release from new tokyo label listen to it on soundcloud or monitors at home and you might write off as a low key groover only suitable for a partys opening hours but in the club you can feel safe playing this to a packed room thanks to heaving sub bass and a collage of synth snippets that only get weirder as they get louder s jazzy and shuffling and label co founder s darker occupy vol 1 s b side both emphasize atmosphere over any one particular element rendering the tracks breezier and more tool like than hello s poignant roller seems to be the first official collaboration from longtime friends daze maxim and jan kreuger lets hope there are more tracks on the way
in an arc from hauschka to kerridge contemplative electronic music is flourishing at the moment the duo of martin and richard dust (two thirds of sheffields lack dog) are the latest to untether themselves from the demands of the dance floor inspired by itamae the japanese chefs who watch a sushi master at work for five years before performing their first practical task the dust brothers spent two years establishing a set of strict rules and methods before they set to work on listening to the album requires a similar amount of patience: headphones close-listening and openness to its abstractness and skeletal precision eats have by no means been abandoned purrs with a sleek funky momentum familiar from the lack dogs work propels along on a sparse shed-ish breakbeat reverberates with the staccato rhythms of detroit electro these tracks are invigorating in their brutality and adventurous djs will make good use of them ( particularly) taken as a whole however isnt defined by motion but atmosphere in a way that recalls kraftwerks radio- ctivity and the corroded textures of current industrial techno is blasted and wintry a devastated wide open space but one that echoes with distant morse code and crackles of radio static the beats ebb and flow but the dystopian tone one of almost cosmic emptiness and longing is what stays with you if that makes sound bleak it is ut there is a cold sombre beauty in its nuclear winter aesthetic a lonesome soulfulness in its sense of alienation the tracks that bookend it are terrifying and exhilarating the sound of worlds falling apart the astonishingly good (and hilariously named) reichs is much more delicate and wistful its watery refracted chimes heart-breaking it may take months to fully absorb an album that is in the best possible way uneasy listening
danish producer tobias hj rnet k is a new face to drum bass and his proper debut comes on an unlikely platform while is based in hj rnets homeland its first two releases have focused on classic-leaning house with just a touch of the hardcore continuum cruises on a submerged 170 pm heartbeat with all the smooth autopilot elegance of the sleekest detroit automobiles the nighttime voyage feeling is enhanced by swirling streams of slide guitar (not unlike fracture neptunes recent customtone ) now for something completely different: lawan is tapped for a remix and provides a speedy house workout his work here bleeds into techno as he takes a drum pattern and feeds it through an especially angry reel-to-reel machine snarling and repeating its broken loop until it becomes sufficiently menacing over the massive tectonic shifting it calls a bassline the bits of slide guitar are a brief reminder of the beauty on the flip but its largely elegant beauty on the one hand and gruff mechanics on the other oth are new looks for the fledgling label but both fit to a tee regardless
s sixth album was created during a difficult time for the chilean-born berlin-based artist following complications during the birth of her first son alejandra iglesias was ordered to stay in bed for three months during her second pregnancy it was during this time before safely giving birth that she produced in a bedroom studio built by her husband matthew styles despite its origins the album is far from a difficult listen lead single is unabashedly optimistic the soulful house sound of american west coast house labels like om is a touchstone which iglesias turns to again for most of sounds as if it wants to swaddle the listener like a newborn in particular feels as light and fluffy as a blanket of cotton wool even more so than on 2013s dimension d iglesias makes her voice the focal point here pairing it with more conventional productions every track has a vocal sometimes multitracked into a choral wash sometimes as intimate as a whisper sometimes sounding like kate bush in many ways these would sound like simple love songs if you didnt know the circumstances that inspired them when she sings we just want to hold you / see you over a warm dubby bassline on it captures the impatience excitement and uncertainty familiar to anyone whos been an expectant parent the delivery of i can see that im losing you slowly on is as poignant as the songs fragile piano dedicated to her eldest son s emotional refrain i dont want you to leave / i dont want you to stay might seem conflicted but the music is far from messy and confused: gentle deep house with a little acid burbling in the background a portmanteau of the names of iglesiass sons also translates as courage but any ideas of bravery in the lyrics dont really extend to the music theres none of dimension d s dark dream-pop and certainly none of the experimental weirdness found on albums like 2009s anemik save for sounds aimed at the radio as much as the club and in making an album of accessible pop-tinged house iglesias has played things safe but in the end what outshines the polish on the surface is the deeply personal emotions at s core
factor city is a label based in barcelona spain factory city s releases span styles varying from electro techno deep techno electronica and post-disco this is release number 6 for the label and it is another absolute gem first up is the ep s title track happy monday the track begins with a lonely beat clicky finger snaps and laid-back percussion in the background there are blurred spacey and melodic synths and atmospheres the track shuffles along as the melancholic voice of the very talented undo are introduced overall this track has a very electro-pop new wave feel to it next up is welcome welcome has a groovier rhythm and is characterised by a bouncy bass-line smooth pads and stabbing electro synths on the flip is the final track titled the sparrow it starts of with lush pad sounds before the beat drops to then introduce a grungy synth sound as the tracks continues twisted effects are layered over the mix this is a sensational ep the standout is the main track happy monday with the brilliant vocals by undo this is definitely a release that should be in the boxes of every dj if you like this one make sure you try and dig up their previous release (spare time the phantom car) which is equally brilliant
aka pete ogrady is not a selector as many have come to understand the term he first emerged in the late 00s as a producer alongside a wave of dubstep influenced uk artists he made an immediate impact 2009s hyph mngo from his debut ep was a ubiquitous dance floor hit ogrady has steadily made music since much of it bass heavy house and techno mostly coproduced by boddika in recent years however hes become equally renowned for his djing as comfortable playing unreleased throbbing uk techno at summer festivals as he is playing leftfield cuts in intimate clubs (a 2016 podcast for shows both styles and several others at play ) the latest selectors compilation purposefully reflects ogradys uk heritage (hes the first british contributor to the series ) where previous editions from motor city drum ensemble ng marco and marcel dettmann have represented particular sounds or eras ogradys focus is geographical he pulls tracks exclusively from british artists several of whom are lesser known the airy digital soul of from 1989 was made by yin agbetu a prolific producer of soul and dance tracks through the 80s and 90s (hes now a social rights activist and filmmaker ) a rephlex released cut by y aka jason comes from an artist who went on to work alongside jarvis cocker as relaxed muscle and wrote songs for the pretenders and marc almond also includes more familiar uk dance music touchstones artwork aka arthur smith surfaces here under his alias most of course will know him better as one third of dubstep group magnetic man or via his association with the dubstep institution big apple records is a dizzying techno tool far removed from say let of this acid released earlier this year r s a 1991 track from reinforced records is a bleep era precursor to the hardcore and jungle with which the label became synonymous ogrady doesnt neglect the present either s aint is a spoken word ode to house parties and one night stands s captures her distinctive diy brand of r b influenced experimentalism all pitch shifted vocal samples and irregular drum patterns from builds curiously its constituent parts gradually coming together into a chugging machine led groove as with past selectors releases the compilation isnt without its pricey discogs wantlist staples but its more than a collection of in demand records in looking to various reaches of uk club music history highlights a musical heritage that ogradys clearly spent many years as a dj and record collector getting to know
is next up on the segment imprint and his unloads two brand new tracks on to the discography of this pretty solid label first up is the title track deeper depths and although it does display some fine sounds and smooth drum patterns the track for me lacks a little direction as a whole for me it falls into the trap of almost disengaging itself from the listener due to its lack of direction despite this the track is quite nice in parts but it doesn t have the elusive cutting edge again knowledge breaks is a smooth breaks cut that flows quite nicely throughout but for me again lacks something giving it the touch that it desperately needs not a bad release but you have got to expect something a little better from this often impressive label
i absolutely hate call no me i think its one of the worst records ever made and i just have to hear the opening bars of it and i have to leave the room why am i telling you this well is eric prydz who was the man behind the tune and this is his latest release for his own label and to say im pleasantly surprysed (sic) is an understatement nile opens up with a kick drum with an arpeggio ruff steadily building up underneath it this builds up slowly before the main bassline comes in and what a beast it is a full on almost electro style sound which will sound amazing on a big soundsystem the twisted sounds come from all angles before the track changes and goes into an almost trancey section with an uplifting key change which reminds me of corporation of one the real life for some reason its amazing how many different ideas prydz packs into this track but they all come off well creating a surefire floorfiller on the flip sucker djs is a much more techno influenced track with the same dirty sound but without the key changes and if your a fan if the current electro influences then youll definitely be into this overall this is a very strong release by eric prydz and one you should definitely track down

knows the value of subtlety its a quality that has taken him very far very fast: after moving from calgary to berlin he quickly found a fan in marcel dettmann enough has been said about what dettmann sees in ford so lets talk about why his music resonates so strongly: he makes rock-solid techno with a surprisingly gentle core you could hear that in the breathy chords of arco pitcairn or any number of the near-beatless tracks hes made which hold their own in a club despite a lack of kick drums is the first release on fords label and at first it seems more straightforward than its predecessors but the devils in the details might have a steamroller kick drum but the bassline and lead synth roll around its contours gracefully while submerged snares add a hint of atmosphere a beautiful two-chord progression and an early breakdown offsets the gut-punch of turning it into an idm daydream features impish drum programming that tugs the track in different directions without interrupting its momentum those tracks are utilitarian but striking but its the final beatless track that shows his unique talent like the tune that introduced him practically floats by while the percussion sounds like it was recorded through a wall the real star is the chords the bright icy synths that feel as grandiose as any techno anthem on ford manages to inject distinctive traits into straight-up techno
its been quite the month for l s dropping four singles in a month while also announcing a new ep from thunder tillman and a moscoman full-length newcomer might get lost in the shuffle if only due to the fact that he doesnt have the easiest name to keep tabs on his discogs artist page hilariously links his first single to a french tango artist and a spanish crooner from the late 50s while obviously an error that does suggest that the berlin-based djs music might be hard to categorize which is part of its thrill dabs a dollop of harmonica into a pistoning electro-tinged track whats nifty is ramoss way of chopping vocals so that they hit like steel drums these snipped exhales and gulps making the track increasingly claustrophobic even more mesmerizing is it starts off as a paranoid acid track fidgeting as a glob of bass gradually settles into a somewhat steady pace while the -side increased its tension becomes looser as it goes the shakers eerie synths and guitars nudging outwards and making more space s it continues to mutate the track sounds like utechre as rendered by cuban percussionists

is it ever a good idea to remix a classic the debate has been back on the table recently on his new 12 inch the first release since his album last year kevin mc uley tackles a pop dance favourite if you overlook the corny rapping s which was released in 1990 and reached 2 in the uk charts is still a nice example of the rave era optimism that was sweeping the uk at the time on his edit mc uley focusses on the tracks dual sense of euphoria and melancholy he takes the originals stirring pads and famous vocal refrain i wanna give you devotion lays them over a faster sharper beat and introduces a new bassline and synth part its a tasteful retouch one where you can almost sense mc uleys original question to himself: i want to play this track out but how can i bring it up to date lthough its billed as a remix the version of s on the side is more a clever reimagining of an acapella the hessle udio crew have been playing it for a while and its exactly the sort of thing that seems to excite them as djs: a stripped back rhythm tool that creates a striking contrast with the tracks around it mc uley sets up a punchy razilian style percussion loop pairs it with a massive bass stab and twists s whoops and shouts to keep the track barrelling forwards where the side feels like a pragmatic update for the modern club this one has spades of individual flair oth however are textbook examples of how to take on the past and win
s like they never left are largely credited as dubsteps progenitors with their debut album in fine style cementing the dark garage style that would eventually mutate into what we now call dubstep (or what we called dubstep back in 2005 anyway) not to mention that their debut release launched the label the imprint that propelled skream benga and more to fame 2004 follow up to the rescue removed some of the light footed skip in favour of cannabis saturated paranoia more dubstep than proto dubstep then they disappeared altogether after founding member benny ill revived the group with new partner jay king last year with the impressive single two other original members allegedly join him again for quest for sonic bounty the idea of a reunion album in a world as obsessed with unceasingly forward trajectories as dubstep seems almost oxymoronic but quest for sonic bounty is so satisfying and complete that it makes the intervening six years irrelevant thats not to say their dubstep is regressive or passe: it just sounds classic horsepower have stripped back their sound to its barest elements replacing much of the middle eastern tinge their early work had with something more north american frontier the reverberating migrant thunderclap of opener sounds like a futurist western movie set in london and its subsequent track continues nudging towards the motif quest is all about classic dub (and dread) make no mistake but the group still find new things to say and new ways to say them takes an uncharacteristically aggressive angle for the group but the sawtooth wobbles combust and healthily diffuse their pent up energy rather than endlessly see saw the album is most inspiring at its weirdest: combines floating metallic drum samples with rainforest noises a hellish and primitive dubstep inversion of their inimitable gorgon sound closer white finally brings those exotic tropes back in for a skewed sliding axis of wonky dub chords breaking out into the peyote fueled psychedelia horsepower have been hinting at for years however one of most divisive idiosyncrasies is in full force on quest for sonic bounty : film samples the album samples dialogue excessively and when the result isnt cringe worthy its usually just annoying on the distracting samples come close to derailing the considerable groove when they work they add to the smoky tavern atmosphere while not all the rhythms are terribly inventive they all sound amazing bright weighty and crisp classic era dubstep is a sound thats become either all too ignored or viewed through rose tinted glasses but its ancestors show that theres life in it yet
justus k hncke s two previous full-lengths on was ist musik (20 ) doppelleben (20 ) were slightly frustrating affairs both albums were filled with clever pop structures quality sound design subtle shifts in mood but somehow they tended to fall short of pure emotional captivation partly of course this was due to k hncke s notorious vocals which are at times just too deadpan at times just too camp (check his destruction of j rgen paape s seminal so weit wie noch nie for the evidence) but the albums were also occasionally marred by k hncke s weakness for soft-focus disco with kitsch rather than glamorous decadent results combines many of these tendencies but happily it s a much more satisfying listen so much so you ve got to wonder what inspired the difference perhaps this more muscular sound is down to k hncke spending a lot of time in the clubs or perhaps it s a product of his new studio (located in an old butcher shop) the newfound help of the album s co-writer/producer fred heimermann (certainly on but likely more) might also be a contributing factor but perhaps there was just something in the air those leaves on the pop ambient-esque cover after all do look suspiciously like marijuana k hncke s disco tendency come to the fore on several tracks but more confidently than on the previous two albums with its 70s strings is downright funky would in an ideal world play on radios in cadillac cars with whitewall tyres molybd n lives up to its elemental name (attn non-scientists: molybdenum is a heavy metal) mimics more disco ball glitter than disco sound itself with sparkling stabs of sound winding analogue washes more overtly disco is the brilliant opener which pays strong homage to slave to the rhythm but then develops its own melodic narrative grace jones isn t the artist from the past to get name-checked the first single from the album is a cover of krautrocker michael rother s track from his 1977 lp flammende herzen not disco but big on authentic retro synths guitars all underscored by strong beats a motorik groove k hncke also gives himself a work over updating from total 7 while 26 one of the albums most potent tracks seems to borrow the slick bass riff from thomas/mayer s panic room the most notable departure from the past however is the absence of vocals (it s be) is the only track to feature k hncke s voice even that is limited to repeating the title as a simple refrain the music underneath meanwhile is promising but the sentiment of the track is a little too simple to be truly anthemic elsewhere purely pop-ambient tracks such as (trans: spooky long-range effect ) capture more evanescent emotions work nicely to change the pace of the album overall apart from a few flat moments (such as the closing title track) this is an excellent pop techno record
dutch producer cut his teeth on marcus intalax s revolve:r/soul:r imprints as a straight up drum n bass artist but slowly he has evolved out on a limb to be one of dubstep s more interesting prospects this is s debut single on his own label following on from his blistering roken 12-inch on revolve:r the two cuts here might not crack the same humid punch as roken and its -side shadowcasting ; instead they show another side of s sound in progress s its title suggests is smoother and more luxurious than his previous work replacing snarling bass rips and curls for melodic terrains and real grooves cascading melodies open the track and playfully interweave into complicated uplifting patterns while the bottom end is almost tuba-like holding steady beneath the melody while the snares build momentum is a more experimental cut but it s still compelling with slowed down voices and droning waves of sound giving way to a dizzying spiral of dubbed riffs shattered voices and crisp snares the key to both tracks is an equal measure of good sound and good composition some of s arrangements are the most involved in the business s his own press statement says what you are listening to is the musical side of dubstep or the dubby side of techno couple this with some label art by influential street artist erosie and you cant go wrong recommended
apart from a recent single for belgian label curle is the first new material from thomas brinkmanns project in the best part of a decade so is eclectics a worthy successor to the seminal iii released back in 2001 is it even worthwhile comparing both works as is often the case context and timing are everything: nine years ago iii predated the minimal explosion and its influence both in sound and design were readily apparent in the years following its release eclectics finds itself amid radically changed circumstances minimalism has become a dirty word downloading has in the eyes of many producers devalued music and there has been a return to sounds from the 90s and in some cases the late 80s in the house and techno spheres it is tempting to posit the theory that faced with the perceived devaluation of electronic musics cultural capital the german producer has reacted by using the image of a urinating horse on the cover whatever the reason the music is as just as playful and provocative with its juxtaposing of splurging distorted bass with dreamy dubby chords sounds like brinkmann is taking the piss out of the basic channel/chain reaction copyists and the serious techno noiseniks in one fell swoop appears to do the same for overly tasteful house music with jazz licks and guitar riffs copper-fastened to a slinky funk bassline while on u it sounds like the german producer is ridiculing disco house as he pitches up filtered loops pitting them against hardcore bass stabs sees brinkmann take on another trend of recent years deploying one of his trademark stripped back rhythms to exaggerate the dubious qualities of kompakt-style trance of course the danger of presenting oneself as a cultural satirist is that the tables can quickly turn but brinkmanns talent and imagination allow him to avoid this scenario both dont the and show the sound explored on iii has progressed their angular stop-start rhythms populated by grimy acid and searing basslines anwhile finds brinkmann in more reflective mode; the tracks understated gradually unfolding groove shows that all joking aside he appears to be concerned about the state of the world with a robot vocal sample that sounds like it was lifted from 2001: a space odyssey talking about computers causing global economic disruption in the main however brinkmann is content to act as a cheekily astute sonic magpie: as soon as schum(ichi) which fuses vocal samples done in the robotic style of kraftwerks radioactivity with distorted pom pom-style techno kicks in its obvious that this is the role he was born to play
s techno bangs as hard as anyones but what youre really feeling is the drama of it all from the stereo-panning breakdowns of take the plunge to more recent synth jams of operatic scale dave huismans music revels in stacking suspense and conjuring shocks ts no different on his latest ep tension is palpable throughout the title track until squeezed between warping sirens and a dark melodic coda its drained of oxygen that sense of anticipation is ever-present and huismans capacity to ambush listeners is largely intact opening with broken techno that flashes like a distant strobe catches you off guard with the close-up ring of a cowbell before coating the drums in lush synths the latter points to another side of huismans production work a love of rich layered samples his sound collages are dense and moreish and when they blend with propulsive energy as on his fever lp the results are remarkable which is only half true of whose b-side finds huismans a little stuck s melodic slosh of synths revisits the sound of fever s aquatic family affair without adding much to it evoking uk funky the snaking synths of mine a recent past without any distinction is thrilling in places and enjoyable in others but it ultimately feels inessential

mike oldfields has an image problem its the track that helped make sir richard branson rich it was the theme for one of the most famous horror films ever made the exorcist and its a cornerstone of the prog-rock canon it is many might say very uncool ( n incredulous discogs user underscored the point when asking who in the name of god does a remix in ) on turns a slightly rearranged segment of the original piano intro into a double-time loop nudging the phrase across his beat even in an abridged form the music is instantly recognisable but this isnt vintage some of the atmospheric overdubs curling wisps of noise doom-laden pads clang against the track at odd angles and the recursive piano loop could do with a break now and then on the other hand the tracks floating countermelody gives the ear something else to focus on and the drums escalating stomp is a hallmark of vincents classic work of all the remixes out there this is surely one of the most interesting the b-sides acid sound also has issues with overexposure what sets apart is the ambient swirl of noise around the 303 sequence: the squalls of an aviary engulfed by what sounds like intercom static or an industrial-sized steam pipe of these two tracks is the gem but will still turn some heads

lobster theremin havent said much about their plans for new offshoot label judging by the romanticism of its name and first release from chester producer and dirt crew alumnus it seems a good bet that itll play host to sun-kissed ethereal fare nyone who caught the bloos first solo ep from earlier this year will know what to expect: sensuous jazzy atmospheres dappled with rhodes notes and the pitter-patter of drums straight from a caribbean beach percussion underpins all four cuts positioning the ep in a sweet spot halfway between the club and a smoky lounge the first three tracks stick a little closer to the latter environment with the glowing piano notes dusty tape hiss vocal motif and padded kicks of the slapping discordant percussion in down has an almost abrasive feel by comparison kicks off with a thudding kick pattern before it relaxes into the eps most laid-back humid moment is a good deal more floor-ready but uses similar ingredients to get there its unhurried twanging build-up and kinetic vocal loop highlight a solid opening gambit for
house music was born out of amateurishness mple documentation exists that shows that the early results were more often than not basic when a handful of enthusiastic chicago clubbers started toying with drum machines in the 80s needless to say these early blunders paved the way for more sophisticated works ut somewhat ironically the pioneering underachievers have come to play a genre-defining role lack of means resulted in a minimalist aesthetic; because of this chicago house will eternally be associated with words like raw rough and muscular in case you didnt notice: thats why he goes by the name of jack far from a dilettantes work s return to erlins imprint is chicago out-and-out: it contains a re-edit of the out-of-print lleviated track from 2000 as well as a fresh production when the label re-issued adies classic ep time reveals last year it was welcomed by a storm of appreciation and charted by the likes of marcel dettmann and loco dice continuing its historical mission released two prescription classics by chez damier earlier this summer on the new sublabel g o d (good old dance) to the beat feel the rhythm of the beat beat beat beat repeats a commanding male voice over a warbled squelch of a groove nd thats it: as simple and effective as that not for nothing this track has the parenthetical: club only less convincing is the -side a more nervous instrumental update of adies jack template: somewhere around the middle a chirpy acid line and dubbed out keys emerge: gladly they add some breadth ut thanks to the standout -side this ep is well worth the money heres looking forward to the next chicago treasure is bound to unearth
its fair to say the vocal skits on s debut album will do little to assuage those who like pinch think dance music doesnt suit the lp format though they are moderately thought-provoking (musing on why people make albums in the first place and stating that you would think everyone knows this music comes out of a black community ) they dont make the record any more coherent overall stead they break up the flow of tracks that in isolation seem keen to induce listeners into a far-gazing trance with their glassy melodies and metallic synth lines that richly melodic sheen is something that characterises most releases on worthys label and it lends his own music a unique personality for someone who admitted to ra in 2010 that he was still very much a producer in the making worthys done a good job of forging a signature sound all i ever wanted to do was be myself says a voice on the opening track and in that regard he succeeds s like are wired up with rusty percussive lines staccato synths and spiralling pads that place you right at the centre of worthys cosmic sound world most of these tracks have icy pads and oversized hi-hats so loud in the mix they make your eyes water this makes them seem to jump out of the speakers not least on with its early planet e soul and manic one-finger key bashing res also something otherworldly about the way ( n c rides up and down the scale with thudding drums deep down below and rattling percussion off to one side its a track that shows the albums great sense of space rather than hurrying from a to b these frosty cuts stretch out in all directions often leaving long trails in their wake
sure we all like envelopes to be pushed and genres to be bent but sometimes (most of the time maybe) you dont need to reinvent the wheel its enough when something just sounds good this new set of tunes released on the berlin-by-way-of-italy label and produced by the duo of massimiliano pagliara and rotciv sounds very good indeed the particular wheel on display here is the same one utilized by metro rea in the early days of this millennium: midtempo schematized electronic disco and boogie precisely arranged and pristinely produced borrows from the mid-80s classic call me mr telephone (the italo disco cut by nswering service not the slightly more hyper cheyne version produced by mark kamins) with the originals loping rhythm guitar line and simple piano phrase augmented by a burbling 303 and a two note bassline straight out of the classic house school of bottom-end action the title track adds cowbells an electro-boogie bass handclaps and some infectiously squelchy synth bits to the mix; on a is the moody one of the bunch they all sound gorgeous but arguably overly studied there will perhaps be some who think that everything is a bit too precise and pristine for those folks theres a fabrizio rerub of which transforms the original into a subtle disco-funk groover its top-tier percussion arrangement (dig that ride cymbal ) adding a bit more life to the cut
even in a scene known for its collaborative nature ristols kowton has had a busy working with peverelist hyetal and julio ashmore since last year his music has occupied a supremely effective middle ground between grime early dubstep and the earthy house of stl and levon vincent with recent single tf going off like a cluster bomb his solo cut on this collaborative 12-inch with julio ashmore what doesnt hit quite as hard but its a marvelous addition to his catalogue nonetheless all razor handclaps and subs that buzz violently through overdriven speaker cones the wide gap between kowtons raw-to-the-bone jack tracks and the smooth stadium-optimised curves of ashmores music makes the two seem unlikely bedfellows on though they pinpoint an undeniably effective middle ground kowtons drums arrive with typically martial force but their impact is softened a little by a bulbous booming ashmore bassline and an earworm of a vocal hook which pushes the track towards anthemic territory it might not be tremendously surprising but the sheer disjoint between the two with kowtons distortion corroding the otherwise catchy accessibility of ashmore makes beguilingly peculiar as big room tracks go the techno mix finds kowton relocating it to the basements where his music feels most comfortable slim-lining the mix and stretching the vocal out into something approaching an anguished whine
uzz can bog down an artist but its not particularly easy for audiences to contend with either how can we really hear an artists music through all that noisy chatter s by a london duo whose musics been rinsed by everyone from pete tong to t williams is just the sort of record you hear about before you actually hear it ut once you do youll quickly be too out of breath to be interested in conversation assy straightforward and absolutely crawling with earworms answers the buzz by cutting right through it expansive yet pulsing and raw the title cut is what you might find if scuba peeled back the neon-and-glitter veneer from his last year of productions found only on the vinyl release is more manic its bass jabs and high-impact handclaps battering you toward a knock-out of an ambient breakdown on the digital exclusive a simple vocal hold me what do what do emerges from the throb at once softening the sound and heightening s urgency ll three sounds are about as light on their feet as any music this slamming could be a collection of big tunes that arent interested in being anthems
there has always been a sense of humorous devilry in nicolas chaixs work even the sinister stabs of lucifer en discoth que his 0 anthem as i:cube were delivered with a sly wink on his latest release on versatile after a hiatus from the label chaix unveils a new alias which emerges from a curious source the label says chaix was inspired to produce after finding a 9th-century french etching but why dither on the story when there is much to enjoy in s debut the a-side has two versions of the first is a bustling house track built around skittering conga-like percussion spurts of acid and a warm bassline but the most prominent element is a hushed french vocal presumably chaixs own which revels in its false sense of foreboding this vocal is all that remains on the subsequent free mix a mariana trench-deep sidestep into beatless acid against this enveloping backdrop chaixs vocal takes on more a sinister incantation-like quality is chaix at his most freewheeling its modulated crust arcs in various levels of intensity over trippy percussion bizarrely the sampled chatter of birds appears near the tracks end its replaced by the nervous intensity of the swirling closing track in which chaix yields to his inner devil
work unspoken has finally got the release it was looking for on shinchi with a quality lineup of producers ready to get busy on the very fine original michael thomas or otherwise known as blackwatch has been on the end of some impressive tracks of the last year or so the original was licensed to deep dish s global underground moscow as the boys have been quite aware of the michael s recent production original mix the original displays a versatile blackwatch in his element first up are the moody vocals and simple effective basslines the beats seem controlled but still driving alongside the vast array of noises and sounds which add to the deep feeling of the track one thing that amazes me is the minimal melody and how effective it is as it paces along with the beat giving it a lighter sound between the deepening groove as the mix hits the breakdown the atmosphere starts to swirl with the haunting effects standing out in stereo luke chable remix luke is certainly the flavour of the last few months with many releases being showcased on many labels here we see him turn in a different direction with a gorgeous break beat remix what amazes me is the originality of luke s beat programming and what he adds into the pot the basslines astound as they tear apart any sound system with its low droning as the track enters the breakdown a sprinkling of a catchy little melody flows over then it is interrupted by the drop of a totally different set of break beats that are totally devastating it is quite an achievement what luke has come up with here and that he can create a two dimensional track which is sure to cause a stir jim duval remix jim is saaed palash s studio engineer and here we see him get freaky and nasty with a tough techy monster the perscussion is fluid as it reels off the unusual high-pitched bongo sample but the fun really starts with the impressive funky edged bassline and echoing vocals as eerie as they are a glorious rolling atmospheric loop gets the full granulising treatment and gives the remaining minutes of this reworking a greater edge of excellence this is a brilliant remix and gives the djs something to tinker with in the clubs jas remix from previous experience jas deep and soulful grooves are always a treat from each release i am able to hear something tells me from the outset of this remix that i have been mistaken firstly the track accelerates into a steady rough n ready beat and then we are treated to the stabbing dark synths which remain prominent throughout tightly arranged percussive elements whip and slap with nothing taken lightly here at all overall this remix is aggressive to say the least and is best unleashed on the people who can handle a good whooping

is the second single from s debut album forever dolphin love released on erol alkans phantasy label its a weird watery song with shades of atlas sound gruff rhys or a folkier bear in heaven; the guitars and acoustic drums move with a lilting almost caribbean shuffle and the voice sounds like tiny tim taking alternating hits of nitrous and helium its all dreamy diffuse and a little disorienting count on michael to find entirely new dimensions of pop hiding inside the contours of the original he does away with mockasins tentative atmosphere swapping out the cobwebbed guitars for sturdy synth bass and light-hearted xylophones all set to a bold major-key chord progression; mockasins vocals become newly assertive even though they never rise above a falsetto whisper its in keeping with supermayers great remix of rufus wainwrights tiergarten but less driving and a tad more whimsical it feels like much of kompakts best material like a sleeper hit the kind of thing youll hear in three years and wonder desperately what it is the horrors tom also has a go at the song; his remix is a super-slow sort of space disco full of congas and keening synths with strings and layered vocals giving it the faintest touch of the sacramental like lindstrom reworking arvo p rt

sydney-based breakbeat producer (aka stu tyson) provides australian based breakbeat label breaking point another dancefloor destroyer in the form of bonx originally appearing on timmy schumachers return of the boomschwack bonx highlights s fascination for the 2-step sound - a sound that originated in the uk underground and urban circles and suffered dramatically when the uk media tied it in with all the violence erupting in the scene boomschwack had featured bonx with the slip of the tongue mix mashing up heavily syncopated 2-step style beats with a futuristic outer space keyboard melody and a ragga style bassline complete with bouncy bass stabs and sci-fi movie effects bonx takes 2-step aboard the international space station playing breakbeats to intergalaxian ambassadors for the single release hes kept it pretty much intact since then but has invited mc duo lords of the fly to provide mc lyrics 2-step and ragga style mcing seem to go hand in hand and lords of the fly provide the perfect vocal offering to sit on the track its pretty catchy and guaranteed to get even the laziest of toes tapping and the single features both instrumental and vocal versions of the tunes and also radio edits - it definitely deserves radio play
its rare for a new producer making classicist dubstep to get noticed these days (beyond the usual diehards) but discovery v i v e k has been finding himself at the centre of a lot of attention unimaginatively-titled is vivek shardas fourth release for the label and it sees him progressing slowly but surely track like does absolutely nothing new really crashing drums carefully surging lfo supposedly ominous speech snippets and creepy dulcet chords but it does it well enough emphasizing subtlety over obnoxious volume loads up the groove with slurred tribal percussion a suitable addition to the dive-bombing alarmist synths and dubwise horns while is shardas take on garage-esque swing weighed down with the heavy-hearted moodiness and dulled evening vibes of the rest of his work its the eps title track thats the real winner; like its not exactly new territory but its so perfectly executed that the context feels irrelevant smoothing halfstep lurch into lush and gentle brushstrokes it ambles along beautifully with careful minor chord piano stabs and hushed diva gasps your typical eyes down track it justifies the eps generic title because it manages to reach a new ceiling for a sound that often allows for lazy functionalism s he lines up more and more releases its becoming clear that shardas talent lies in the little touches he adds to conventional dubstep the lush synths he sneaks into his tracks and the majestic almost sensual way his drums hit
with surgeon and karl oconnors british murder boys project consigned to history and speculation about its implosion still doing the rounds on message boards both parties have moved on and are working on other collaborations surgeon performs as frequency 7 with ben sims while oconnors first release proper with james ruskin as they remixed ruskins lahaine is re-launching ruskins blueprint label may not be as extreme as either producers back catalogue but it does expertly use some of the sounds and many of the production techniques that are common to their work the title track has a measured pace but its panning repetitive groove is underpinned by heavy kicks that give it an edge likewise panel beating drums and raw acid licks provide the clubby with an unspoken sense of menace shows again that the devil is in the detail; its deep dense unrelenting rhythm populated by bursts of steely percussion guarantee the end result is dynamic rather than monotonous is nothing revolutionary but at a time when the re-emergence of harder techno threatens to be railroaded by big room bluster or worse still trance indulgence the dark side is safe in these veterans hands

jamie odells sixth album nd wasnt awash in obvious singles though typically refined as r s kristan caryl pointed out it suffered from a polished sheen [that] is sometimes hard to penetrate it made for a more than pleasant home listen but wasnt top of the pile for djs seeking club bangers se remixes which rework two of the albums deepest moments arent nearly so reticent dmittedly reticence has never been a problem for kink though his version of the albums title track doesnt scale the heights of say his remix of deetrons out of my head it puts odells soporific original through a similar wash hookiest elements are beefed up the organic drums and chimes are given a more electronic polish and in the final third he teases in a euphoric detroit synth line that puts the track firmly in peaktime territory ndre ns remix of is dubbier opting for a more early-hours atmosphere that at first seems content simply to roll meaty subs beneath minimalist synth flickers ut then comes the breakdown n takes elements odell employed as mere texture and layers them slathers them in reverb and then brings back the opening bassline that recontextualised crackles with new energy where the originals were shy of development these remixes revel in their final acts
makes an appearance here for the 9th release on his imprint and the production comes with a solid original mix as well as a king of cool breaks mix the original mix is first up and on the whole the track is not too bad but nothing outstanding it s helped by a pretty good baseline however the drums and other sounds that caress that baseline are somewhat lacking a nice twisted set of sounds come into the play midway in adding the touch to take it up the notch it needed to go on the flip is the king of cool breaks mix and for me this reworking is slightly better then the original mix as it adds a nice quirky touch which works very well with the baselines and original melodic sounds of the original not a bad release here with the original providing a nice moment but it is the quirkiness and unique nature of the b-side that gives this release a nice lift
fter a sterling turn on turbo tim van de meutter k returns to hotflush with a further slice of shifting restless techno is a little less glossy than hotflush debut rooted and like its title would suggest its a marathon favouring the same thick brute textures as his turbo work is all about the big clomping hunks of metal he calls drums subtly morphing over a bouncy and overdriven bassline just when you think thats all there is to the track de meutter throws in a pumping chord motif that sends things reeling into climax with its leisurely yet insidiously epic pacing cant help remind me of len fakis rainbow delta another track that made peaktime pyrotechnics out of what seemed like simple unassuming elements the b-sides are simpler affairs utilizing the same formidable grasp of texture and maximum impact as ller with its persistent chord progression is arguably even more melodic than the -side but its brutish breakbeat doesnt carry the same gliding momentum while is a downcast thumb-twiddler that dips into the same deep house territory as change on his first hotflush ep with a lead track that might be his best yet and two lesser but still competent tracks continues a strong year for the belgian newcomer
first appeared earlier this year on a split 12-inch crime city discos debut record with the summery reathless the two tracks on jaktmarks first solo slab could barely be any different yes theyre still house of the slower variety but where reathless was blissed-out and sauve here the swedish producer shows a wistful side the centrepiece of the eponymous track is its meandering bass sequence for the first half all its accompanied by is a series of washed-out claps with their bite completely excised on the whole it almost sounds like the work of stuart li k asic soul unit until the breakdown that is when jaktmark introduces gentle splashes of electric piano and similarly washed out hand drums from here the mellow chords take over from the low end offering an easy ride to the finish though on the surface it sounds quite different to his debut the unhurried progression is the same uses a similar technique a fluid bassline leading before a diaphanous motif enters at the halfway mark its not quite as compelling though; the offbeat chords which run the whole way through feel a touch arbitrary still ergmarks ear for harmony continues to impress; is well worth the pennies

sultan and the greek (aka tone depth) have been responsible for countless remixes and productions over the years working together on tracks from people such as portishead whilst having original productions showcased on high-class compilations such as deep dish s toronto global underground rezin encapsulates smooth beats and rhythms with gorgeous synths which constantly take effect throughout the track the breakdown is long and teasing with soft stabbing synths and low sounds but is brought back in with solid double beats and distorted effects the track remains quite minimal throughout with the element of groove around each corner the valentino mix of rezin picks up the beats showcasing a strong percussive element with the original melodic loop and rolling acid effects some strings are introduced into the breakdown and give off a moody feeling which are then greeted by some wiked synth chord action alongside building melodies short pounding bongo samples come in every 32 beats and really add to each section from breakdown to mid climax nice interpretation on the melody by valentino wadi is another minimal emotional piece which features beautiful vocals atmospheric sounds and simple baselines the melody rotates as it drifts in softly or is looped and reverbed but the main feature here is the vocal as the lyrics push the track along quite an impressive release with deep house on the menu valentino s mix will give you that dance floor hit
hasnt released a full ep through fachwerk the label he runs with mike denhert and sascha rydell since late 2012 that wouldnt mean much except that save for the odd remix or compilation track here and there lindau doesnt produce for anyone else as a result his latest ep is an overdue return for the berliner two sides of lindaus sound are on display here is the kind of clever tool both house and techno djs can use laying stifled stabs over a punchy bed of kicks clicks and militant snares theres not a huge amount going on but its certain to keep any set moving forward the title track on the other hand is pure blistering techno razor-sharp synths slash their way across a relentless barrage of thumping drums and rhythmic maracas building towards a single devastating crescendo
arnhem-based producer has been involved in the progressive end of trance and techno for more than two decades since leaving france his home for the past five years for the netherlands hes networked with some illustrious compatriots its resulted in him snaffling an ageing yamaha keyboard from danny legowelt wolfers (albeit for his son says klinkenberg) and securing a spot on whose curators joris voorn and edwin oosterval have attracted a notable roster ripperton stimming and deetron besides voorn himself to their label over the past half decade while there are still vestiges of his trance heritage here most notably in the tracks melodic throb klinkenbergs sound has developed into dub-techno explorations 1 neatly balances a mechanical bounce with bass thats wrapped in thick fleecy layers on klinkenberg samples his young son (him talking not using that keyboard) on a slice of lithe sinuous dub ambience this is an ep that doesnt pretend to break new ground its best to just succumb to its hypnagogic wash
continue their remix series with the second of four vinyl releases of in house producers keeping it in the family back to back style and nja get the once over this time a la pan pot and gummihz who set out to claim back the spotlight from the label s two leading names undoubtedly the biggest moment on thus far gets pulled apart by the pan pot production team of marco resmann tassilo ippenberger and thomas benedix like their dog track this digs deep: it s shadowy tech house with a seductive bass and tribal tappings that ll cast a spell slightly similar to the stefanik sound at times this is a worthy remix of a great original s ddicted is next on the chopping board with lexander tsotsos (aka gummihz) given free reign to slash about with his scalpel man renowned for his elasticated frequencies and general wobbliness lexander serves up another trademark tripped out mindbender sort of a guido on valium type of vibe here with the mid range given a spacey feeling via bags of delay however if the prosecution has a case it might take a very openminded dancefloor to appreciate this very off kilter piece of work berlin is a place of inspiration for many at the moment and home to the posse with its rave influenced minimal sound it seems like an exciting place to be the label does provide something different from the multitudes of minimal out there but whether floors outside berlin will lap it up as hungrily is another matter
returns with his first outing for after remixing jesse rose s its so in late 2006 arrives on saul s busy label this time with added ergonomics on the flip from isol e saul s effort comes as a breath of fresh air miles away from minimal tick tock and electro anthems du jour his style here rolls a lot deeper than most with crisp seductive arrangements building analogues riffs and simple percussion definitely one to build sets with is a warm deep house number that ll likely have charles webster and gilles peterson all over it grower isol e is a name that slips under too many radars he should really need no introduction his refit here is a wise one: the original did not need much changing and isol e keeps the cleanliness the lead lines and the chugging slow bpm adding only his usual attention to detail in the form of subtly bent chords small flicks and gorgeous pads of the two i think the isol e remix holds up more; it has a worldly wise accent and it ll definitely get the reaction required if dropped at the right time sonar by day anyone once again the blueprint of deep house is influencing all - bring on the 120bpm parties
as members of bristols young cho collective neek and amos childs have various projects on the boil but as o vmv m they do one very specific thing: loops across a cassette and an p last year they locked a motley collection of samples into elegant slow-mo repetition y stick to this humble remit on their follow-up which features another ten tracks each passing in the slow blink of a drowsy eye yve refined their technique and bits of o vmv m have an emotional pull lacking on the duos other records this might be down to the skilful use of singers sometimes theyre obviously sampled as with the delicate womans voice in which stutters and flutters over the gentlest hint of a head-nodding beat sometimes it might be the duo themselves as on where a male falsetto emotes over gorgeous twirling rhodes and sometimes theyre processed into a raspy melisma beyond recognition: is quietly pretty is gloomier o vmv ms straightforward sound lends itself to a surprising variety of moods but this ps best moments are on the sweeter side soft-rock guitar of makes for an excellent opener and with its gentle melodies is the highlight darker moments arent so charming particularly whose sinister piano and downpitched voice sound like a moonlit encounter between dj screw and bohren der club of gore
scroll facebook page and youll get a strong sense for the kind of music thats inspired the east london labels launch posts of tracks by the likes of fj der monoaware and gasometric run convey a love of techno built from off-kilter rhythms and dubby sounds the uk artist fold whos one of a group of otherwise anonymous producers behind the label showed similarly deep tastes on a recent nts show which featured a guest mix from the newcomer responsible for wsrs first release comprises four dreamy broken techno cuts delivered in punchy high-definition clarity though the tracks vary in pace and mood theres a freshness and full-bodied feel to the eps sound design throughout match this with adventurous drum programming and a keen ear for melody and youve got the basis for an impressive debut the opener takes a couple of minutes to get going before unfurling one of this years funkiest and most supple basslines with its puffy pads and weepy earworm centrepiece has all the early-hours glow of a great sued record if slightly more polished the same goes for the title track which crawls with unsteady percussion and hazy heavenly chords up until this point positions himself firmly to the left of the dance floor but to finish he takes one step to the right wouldnt is charged with the rude energy of the post-dubstep days all entwined rhythms bassy stabs and intermittent police sirens like the rest of its production values are top-notch
is a label out of malm with a fondness for the deeper sides of techno as well as trolls and gnomes (as you might have gathered from the name) a key part of its mission is the artwork which comes from john bauer a painter of warmly imaginative creatures and scenes launched in late 2012 and a regular host of events in malm first release a typically plaintive one from recondite called waldluft came out last july the label now finally returns with the sleek spectral sounds of s modersk rlek ep hpa is 12 minutes of test-depth techno the longest track prc has made and one of his most subtly cerebral its filled with rhythmic ticks pitter-patters that grow from a simmer to a boil and the sort of precisely contoured aural architecture that hes become known for is more straightforward floor fare all rustling hi-hats airy drones and a heavy acidic lead that makes for an ideal layering tool last is a low-key remix of hpa from svreca who drops the originals stirred-up underbelly but keeps its spacious gloomy vibe and adds intensifying sprays of static and jangling percussion later on with albert van abbe handling the next release and inigo kennedy also due to appear in some form the future looks bright for

a press shot of arms folded and holding a keytar says a lot about where hes coming from the french producers house music is bathed in rich american synth-funk influenced as much by roger troutman as dr dre shorn of the drexciyan spasms on his two eps for clone crown the sugar cane chronicles vol 1 is a feel-good record bathed in buttery bass and sunlit synths its melodic dexterity speaks to gritnesss years spent as a session player for the likes of d m-funk mike huckaby and louie vega on preachin and gritness runs wild with his keyboard and hes at his best on these tracks next to them feels undercooked and superfluous gritness really goes for it on : as it approaches a crescendo at least three instruments jam in unison held by a loop on the verge of bursting it could easily have become a mess but gritness never gets carried away with his virtuosic performances the sugar cane chronicles vol 1 draws from the same pool of ideas but gritness mixes things up on stayin its pensive top notes help balance an otherwise sweet record
is it possible to call someone who has put records out on the mighty perlon imprint underrated if so k stephan laubner would fit the bill then again he probably prefers it that way resident of sleepy harz germany pictures are scarce of the producer his deep house productions reveal little about him and his ambient field recordings yield even less in fact the only thing you can really say for sure about laubner is that hes deeply interested in grooves and how he can extend them forever laubners latest for his own records imprint like his other vinyl releases for the label have a variety of locked grooves that should allow inclined js to transcend their seconds-long length ut as you could hear on mark es r podcast the same goes for the longer tracks too which comes first on this 2x12 package does little more than work a well thought-out drum loop through the paces while simultaneously wrapping two pieces of analog funk in and around the proceedings its a simple trick and one that laubner uses again and again throughout lest you think this type of thing is easy though think back to the last time that minimalism like this worked so well my touchstone is mr oizos nalog worms ttack sure laubner may be the stoner older brother into house music and quentin upieux the impatient -addled child of hip-hop but the comparison is an apt one theres not much to be said about laubners tracks because like oizo theres not too much to them is the sound of melancholic restraint a dirty loop echoing into infinity surrounded by otherworldly elements that rarely do anything but push it further into the stratosphere exquisite stuff
formerly known as throwing shade has a wide musical range her nts show has been an outlet for jazz rock synth pop electronic music and field recordings from across the globe clubs she plays a rich selection of funk disco and house as a dj she exudes confidence; as a producer she has yet work it out the past few years shes yed with several styles pop techno post-internet hybrids but the results sometimes fell flat now on her full-length debut for she makes another subtle shift on a bona fide pop album the london artist goes back for something that dance music has left behind: fuzzy washed-out guitar the lp brings mind bands like my bloody valentine and slowdive but only as an echo rather than reinvention iqbal feeds her guitar vocals and 80s-sounding synths through spacey delays and then arranges them in light and mellow pop tracks the barest constructions are some of the finest is built on just three sullen elements chords vocals echoing guitar where iqbals vulnerability becomes arresting blushes with half-sung lyrics and gauzy guitar plucks has a heavier drum pulse but the rest exists in a haze: the cloudy vocals the glimmering loops the psychedelic guitar where iqbals past work felt like a sugar rush now its more of a smolder pop verses are another uch that give the album broad appeal sually spoken or cooed iqbals lyrics are as easy grab as an extended hand especially if youre a 20-something in crisis besides love iqbals lyrics are mostly about the pressure achieve on she sings you live die / the skys o high ntitled a house track overlays its silkiness with the fear of being unfulfilled ( is a flower / fear is right behind she sings ) on the albums highlight to the lyrics ring true any dreamer with a day job rushing by with warm pads glowing chord changes and the plushest of basslines its the most electric track iqbal has ever done but sounding like a band also has its drawbacks iqbals case its because she doesnt always come close enough the drums on some of the upbeat tracks lack a natural feel something thats troubled iqbals records all along even if the shimmering reverb gives the veneer of guitar musics past its hard really rock out tracks like or theyre dreamy sounding but the rhythms are dry and rigid the effect is atmosphere without a core this doesnt s p from being a nice album with enough listens youll even catch yourself humming its melodies but the ideas come close feeling generic his criticism of iqbals last ep andrew ryce described it as throwing shade by numbers that is airy pop with a predictable approach on this lp guitar music provides a new direction but not necessarily more impact
is essentially more of the same from the label that brought you obis jam rapy ep both records are love letters to vintage uk garage with a particular focus on rhythm: the grooves are extended and they flicker and flex relentlessly bristling with micro edits and neat details s new effort though the stuff around the drums is a bit different titular twinkling bells are arranged into dissonant melodies on augmented by puffs of spooky background atmos think el bs pre dubstep paranoia also dials in a pretty bold compression setting making the beat lurch like a mutt on a lead in the latter half noir ish rhodes chords offer some welcome relief thats the original version anyway version reworks the bells and notches down the tempo allowing the dubby bassline to carry a bit more weight following jam rapy s lead a remixer is then invited to work in a different soundsystem style res a digi dub flavour to prince s two versions version transposes the bells onto a slower dembow beat where they trade bars with an aggy two note bassline version is surprisingly chill thanks to its smeared midrange chords supplied presumably by the titular casio keyboard both do the job but its in uk garage that the obstacle label really excels
ever since his 2004 tech-disco smash which conquered dancefloors in both its original and remixed form (courtesy of dominik eulberg) steve arnes has taken that track s title as his primary production moniker (releases still appear under his own name and his process guise) it s been a reasonably quiet year for arnes so far despite having remixed hot chip to well uninspiring effect and having commissioned versions of his own 2005 belter man in ox from the talented likes of patrick chardronnet and ndre kraml so this new 12 on cologne s arrives to a real rustle of underground anticipation well the first thing to say is that neither track on this excellent record lives up to the mighty and nor should they be expected to that track emerged at the right time and at the right place fashioning something perfectly discerning and original out of familiar components while eulberg s epic reimagining upped the warp factor to the point of darkest ecstasy and remains arguably the german s finest moment oth those versions have been if not copied then absorbed into the language of modern 4x4 production a curse and an accolade that is unlikely to be repeated the eponymous -side to is nonetheless an entirely satisfying affair dubby but sharp minimal house that rhythmically-speaking favours disco snap over techno thud but is full of the kind of hyperactive edits and gritty squiggling computer melodies that make it a worthy tool to have in your box it s not however one of those tunes that ll have people coming up to you and asking what s this there s a concerted shift in style for on the flip; while is a deliberately sparse uncompromising groove (no bad thing) the -side recalls dj t s finest moments tasteful electro-house with plenty of melody and beef and a high-pitched synth motif appearing two minutes in that ll put smiles on faces any time of day or night in short a top-notch 12 which fails to eclipse arnes finest work but blows a fair few of his so-called contemporaries out of the water if you dug man in a ox get your mitts on this
next up on robbie rivera s imprint is a release from dj rooster sammy peralta entitled alongside an original mix and a capella it comes armed with remixes from robbie rivera himself as well as the very much in form steve angello first up is the original mix and the production flows quite nicely with some crisp drums and some deep moving baselines as well as an electro tingled riff the electro elements become stronger as the track progresses with stronger riffs after the first breakdown especially not a bad production even though i m not too convinced by the vocals robbie rivera puts his remix in on the a-side and it has a very strong baseline in it from the word go as it rumbles its way for the most part of the track it is a very good remix with the highlights being ht every strong low end sounds as well as the twisted and eerie effects steve angello s remode mix on the b-side has his trademark funk to it with sinister base tones working well alongside busy hi hats and looped vocal effects it s another very addictive remix from angello that is for certain the a capella is on the back of the b-side for those who may like the spoken vocals of the track this is quite a good release with all 3 mixes being strong dance floor mixes that is for sure
summarize the second entry in dj harveys project in only two words easy: harvey sings nd those figuring that packs of marlboro reds might have given him a tom waits-ish gruff that throat of his is surprisingly ritpop-sleek if a bit nondescript t its best it recalls level 42s mark king but its not the kind of vox to lend itself to the somnambulant track its line that its nice sleazy one should be wary of anyone stating upfront that theyre either its not helped by the rest of the lyrics more successful is more in line with harveys renaissance stomping with weird electric droplets all around the beat it somehow stakes a ground between robag wruhme (especially in the tiny echoing moments that dot the track) supermax go figure that the melody line reminds me of of all things janet jacksons pleasure principle for a dj who best embraces the lizard mind lets hope the next slithers toward such principles
freu am tanzen has put out plenty of records by a healthy number of good artists ( dj koze and onur zer among them) but its best known as be g the home away from home of the wighnomy brothers together and apart thats not a small th g but its also true that apart from (whether as rolf oksen or themroc or just himself) and and sometimes with them the label itself doesnt tend to make the spotlight its home freu am tanzen is variable like any label is but theres a steady state quality to its work that tends to fa a bit when proffered piece by piece conversely thats just the quality that tends to make for a good compilation con nse it down and youve got a statement freu am tanzens newest collection isnt a masterpiece or anyth g but it is one of those multi artist discs that move as one th g with one purpose a patchwork that plays like an album and each appear of course the former with the patiently bubbl g hero house gone slightly pop of crucial the latter with halfbottle whose slow warp synths ch g g percussion and whapp g little breakbeat make it sound like someth g from an art jungle comp circa 1997 but its material not personnel per se that make hum its more songful than you might expect and that helps give the proceed gs some heft dehlia s tense vocal on s low key soundtrack ish is a good example the other plus here is the exceptionally good sequenc g gli s effortlessly to s lower key but tonally similar halfbottle is s natural climax with s cooled down coke bottle percussive as its obvious coda: slurry space cl ed synths that loll and stretch over a muted version of the hall oates i cant go for that beat pattern the one stumble comes at the f ish with the liberate comedown of s whose spoken bill drummond sample ( imag e wak g up tomorrow morn g and all music has disappeared all musical struments and all forms of recor d music: gone ) sounds a little cloy g after the relative mo sty of all that prece d it you take your chances with comps
bent on solitary window gazing apparently doesnt want anyone to obstruct his view seattle-based producers a bit of a recluse withholding his name in favor of his nom de recording with only a free download ep to date his debut album is bound to bring him even more attention frostbitten and serene melds deep 4/4 pulses with vivid treated guitarscapes that evoke seasonal transitions things that fall crumble and get iced-over every year only to hold warmth within until all passes over for green again blending snowblind ambience with touches of techno and shoegaze could have opened any of the cold-bathwater tracks on slowdives pygmalion for example hes mining territory similar to artists like field or even pantha du prince but with longer lapses in consciousness and plenty of stylistic thumbprinting all his own my mention of 4/4 thump against such enveloping long-birthed ambience is sure to recall wolfgang voigts gas project and certainly doesnt shrink from the likeness both and resemble voigts throbbing lullabies; they emanate the same kind of easy rest like living organisms at peace and slow-breathed but when allows the seams around his guitar treatments to show as with the elongated guitar drones of or the swaying beatless froth of he stresses the tools over their effects he moves away from what at times seems like an almost naturally-captured emotionality a sound design at once formed in the studio but also somehow bell-jarring overnight stillness bird hush its these moments where his moodiness is most distinctive e-bow guitar of lifes and yes his titles are cheerlessly apt ripples and sways into its sudden meaty rhythms while is even more effortless in its expanse with static singing the edge of guitars that linger and moan so long they begin to resemble classical strings though i hesitate to return to the comparison inevitably many who hear will write it off as sometimes a too-literal approximation of one of modern electronic musics monoliths but alludes to the british rock music of the late 80s/early 90s just as much as classical or ambient works and patient listeners will soon notice just how sturdy his tracks are for all of their affected fragility fter all gas is finished fields making hotel soundtracks and krankys offering windy carl records mark xxii (not a complaint) sure may owe such artists a drink or two but on his debut hes making such beautiful fingerswirls out of the stuff they left behind that eventually the debt may shift
sticking to the s ethos of pushing brand new sounds emanating from ristol the focus for its 11th vinyl single is squarely on a producer hailing from jokers purple-clothed camp of south western synthesizer dexterity s approach is different however from the aforementioned joker and recent signing gemmy sure hes using the same dr dre inspired g-funk leads but the feels like its rolling around at about 95 pm a far cry from dubsteps standard 140 pm efore you get to that though we have which rolls on stripped-to-the-bone percussion in the same way that shackleton layers drum tracks over each one another to create that essential drive piles on moog textures as if his life depended on it utilising midi strings horns pianos and an array of incessant melodies constantly evolving through instruments and melodies he shows not only a sure hand for creating hooks but a desire to ply as many of them into three-and-a-half minutes as possible ut back to : sounding somewhere between an 80s action film love scene and a square bass-driven hudson [mohawke] heater drops saxophone melodies and double time hi-hats the sexualisation of the brass section definitely gives the track a passionate-on-screen-love-making-montage kind of vibe that evokes teenage memories of averting your eyes from those awkward moments in films when your parents are sitting right next to you in the theatre its on this track that s production really shines; he manages to inject his incessant middle 16 bars of pure bass pressure with an air of understated elegance as he twists the delicate texture of grand pianos around the 80hz onslaught
sci-fi-influenced electronic music is a clich at this point cant shake a stick without hitting a producer who cites films like blade runner and ghost shell while dystopian narratives and imagery are equally commonplace it makes nathan micays latest project as seem dubious at a glance capsules is based on katsuhiro otomos classic 1988 anime akira whose aesthetics have since permeated popular anime and science-fiction films but micays approach saves the music from abstract lip service: he samples the original soundtrack and dialogue from akira reshaping it into a mix of dance music and downtempo electronica a career highlight for micay capsules is an inspired and personal piece of music even as it stays remarkably faithful to its source material akira is about a young motorcycle gang in 2019 who get wrapped up in a conspiracy much bigger than them saga involves the government the military and the untapped psychic powers of one of the bikers tetsuo its an emotional story about friendship set in a grim cyberpunk universe and it came with an equally affecting soundtrack from shoji yamashiro a mix of traditional japanese instrumentation with 80s pads and synths the music still sounds vaguely futuristic 25 years later making it good source material for dance music sparse arrangements are easily funnelled into stiffer more rhythmic forms concept of remixing an ost might seem like a gimmick but micay is a versatile producer who can pivot from making post-dubstep anthems to uncanny trance throwbacks capsule s highlights his multiple talents as micay expertly translates yamashiros mix of wonderment and anxiety into a record of alternately wounded and energetic electronica capsules is split between slick dance floor cuts and atmospheric pieces capsules transforms the fragile bell refrain of tetsuo into a storming trance-y monster complete with the rousing basslines micay learned from years of listening to old global underground mixes dips into low-slung trap with the films unmistakable squealing woodwinds while kiyokos is a sad beatless track that uses micays proggy leanings to heart-tugging effect micays handling of akira s more recognizable elements is savvy akiras and colonels scientists both incorporate the childlike chant from yamashiros dolls polyphony former is an uplifting sasha-esque glide while the latter leans towards deep house with a tunneling bassline that captures the nervous excitement of tetsuo finally discovering akiras burial site dont need to know the story to enjoy these moments but if you do youll know how compelling micays retelling is perhaps a nod to certain cd versions of the ost theres dialogue all over capsules chants of a-ki-ra emerge every once in awhile and snippets of speech offer updates on the narrative those cheesy bits of english overdubs make capsules feel all the more earnest which is the key here res no way you could pay tribute to something as widely lauded as akira without looking just a little goofy micay thankfully seems unbothered by the thought this is an artist who openly sings the praises of prog mix cds from the early 2000s plays xpander in panorama bar and made ebullient tracks like tengo and flute dreams when you get down to it capsules is just the latest record that finds micay wearing his heart on his sleeve
following the set of remixes from paul rogers return to the forefront with a quality release from chris gainer and paul rogers in their guise as they deliver three varying tracks in this latest release readers waves pt 1 is on the a-side and it is quite simply a top draw productions the beats are lively and up-tempo and a smooth rolling baseline gives the track a upbeat vibe for the most part nice melodic synths are a nice welcome midway into the track as it continues to build and the changing of the tone of the melody is also a solid method used by the duo quality melodic progressive at its best with this track comfort guide on the flip is quite unique with the speed of the track measuring at a smooth and chilled 100bpm smooth beats flow with twirling effects and smooth strings all playing their part in keeping this track nice and melodic at a chilled and downbeat pace to be used for those late night or early morning sunset sets intromate is a nice cheeky bonus track on the end of side-b and can be used nicely to open a set with its smooth hats and quirky effects a pretty strong release from with the a-side in particular shining brightly with its melodic overtones and driving baseline
michael fiedler the berghain resident also known as is a bit of a late bloomer granted hes always been good he and errorsmith have been making riotous club tools as mmm since 1996 but its only in the last few years that hes stepped out as a solo producer the result has been a series of electrifying dub-informed techno records all released on his hard wax-distributed label one though still something of a well-kept secret their taut rhythms and reduced aesthetic have made them a favorite among berlin djs his latest ep shows him further perfecting his singular style the title track is in full effect: a lean and tactile slice of techno with drums like carved porcelain and chords like rubber in a subtle flourish the snare hits only on the three lending a dubby wobble to an otherwise linear beat drops the 4/4 pulse completely to deliver a menacing ultra-wide dub groove once again the composition is bold and sparse its immaculate drums floating in space
used to go by hatfield peverel junglist massive hatfield peverel being the bristol-based producers essex hometown and jungle being the genre most important to him tessellation or tiling is when a shape is repeated over a surface without gaps or overlaps its hard to think of a better description of jungles core technique in which discrete breakbeat units are stitched together into a delirious patchwork of syncopation tom fords music does this at lower tempos: drums and melodies loop in dense orbit their repetition inducing a powerful hypnotic effect this approach has made him one of the most distinctive producers in recent british dance music though low-profile he has helped reorientate uk dance floors twice: first as a key bristol dubstepper of the late 00s and then as one third of who set the hybrid techno coordinates followed by many young producers his first album since 2009 doesnt reflect a third breakthrough moment instead it consolidates and celebrates an inimitable style at its best the albums deft configurations of familiar sounds are enough to make you fall in love with his tessellations all over again the stronger tracks come in the albums first half offsets a ten-ton sub-bass throb with chord stabs that spray like spume it has the trademark feeling of hovering over a euphoric drop moment that never quite comes s emotive charge is heightened by a tightly swung groove: snares and skeins of trancelike melody skid across the groove trailed by a controlled avalanche of claps toms and ride cymbals echoes the most austere productions in its menacing slouch and sinister dial-tone arp in usual style these hits are delivered without flourish or extravagance a brief beatless intro and outro are the only concessions to the album form otherwise his ideas are presented with a directness befitting a dance 12-inch this only becomes a problem in the albums second half as the energy dips slightly is a fairly straight nod to detroit with light-dappled chords and driving 4/4 a little too spacious and sombre lacks that junglist rush the subdued is an odd choice for the albums final full track it gives way to a stern ambient outro called and maybe thats what this album represents: a levelling out of fords sound at least for now but flatness isnt the only thing that defines a plateau theres also elevation not many producers reach his giddy heights
mother tongues offshoot is a hip hop label dedicated to showcasing the talents of female hip hop artists both on a local australian level and on an international level previous releases have included the compilation first words and also mc treys debut ep daily affirmations for the latest release they go to france and exhibit one of frances few female mcs - the french equivalent of missy elliot 6 years after the release of her debut album black mama laistee returns to the fore with her follow up her music has a catchy pop appeal very similar to the sounds of missy elliot yet she has a tough street oriented rhyme style which some compare to mc lyte whereas i would put it somewhere closer to eve the album features a wide range of hip hop styles there are r b infused tunes like diamant noir (black diamond) featuring the vocals of lynnsha which let tough laistees rhyme style shine yet keeps things dancefloor oriented karai-b-o has a bouncy carribean feel similar to tunes like 50 cents p i m p and gives listeners a taste of laistees carribean roots laistee pulls off a cover of aretha franklins classic 60s hit respect entitled un peu de respect and its an all female head to head battle as she goes up against diams for control of the mic other highlights on the album include the latin influenced douce france which features a flamenco guitar riff and provides a nice lead up to cette nuit another tune with a latin groove and more r b soul vocals she also teams up with one of frances hottest production teams tiwony for negropolitain and from the sounds of it it has a jiggy club-oriented appeal isnt the saviour album destined to change hip hop forever it is however a fun release one that is aimed straight at the dancefloor and highlights the strengths of the french hip hop scene due to my inability to speak french its hard to translate what shes rhyming about but from her flow and tone she doesnt appear to have the bitchy and indeed porn-oriented appeal of rappers like lil kim perfect for those who are fans of artists like missy elliot and eve and have always wondered how their styles would translast into french
is the first release on a new opal tapes sub-label called beatrice annie its maker jon pritchard is formerly known as the beats producer young montana as such this is an ep from familiar if obscured faces it contains recognizable elements but theyre served with a twist take which mostly does what it says on the tin by serving up fugue in a classical albeit digital style only to finish with a detuned supersaw la lorenzo senni the effect returns in eventually merging with baroque melodic arpeggios with ghostly results go d fi re and have the structure of a woozy beats track with a low bitrate vaporwave makeup go d fi re has a young montana -esque see-saw swing while has the klak-klak heartbeat of 2-step and mangled vocals parts of might be familiar but it induces a sense of wonder tinged with confusion a sure sign that youre experiencing something new
if s cosmosis vol 1 got back to basics for the sci-fi- and synth-themed king britt project then vol 2 confidently stays there this second installment of the philadelphia natives series follows the format of one techno track on the a-side and two beatless pieces on the flip and britt is once again in top form in fact might one-up the jittery thrust of sonic six tapping into a cosmic off-kilter groove somewhere between dubstep and dub techno icing on that ones cake is a sawtooth bassline that creeps in to carry it all to the starry expanse above vol 2 gets vangelisian on the b-side a turn from the hi-def synth experiments of faith and past instead and are more tuneful almost symphonic and the style befits but for all the poignant melody and rich texture what makes these tracks stand out most is their smart use of rhythm britt crafts an entrancing syncopation from the multi-layered synth patterns in never losing sight of their interactions through every flux and phase throbs with the steady pulse of rolling three-note bass arps its hard not to wonder what would happen with a beat under these tracks though that would probably just undermine their impeccable composition

having built up a head of steam with two impressive releases for pictures music debut once more shows a predilection for snarling sharp-elbowed tech-edged house tightly-wound tribal drums dominate joined by vocal samples stretched taut like rubber bands and a tripped out synth motif (are there hints of superchumbos revolution in there ) it threatens to go nuttier than it actually does settling to play out to a gritty percussive throb champs builds around a more looser framework of click-clacking wood blocks sharp flashing kicks and some nice jabbing pads the use of quirky vocal samples are still there although in truth you wonder if theyre a bit too intrusive and might benefit from being stripped out altogether the best of the triumvirate is a coarse mid-set pace changer which quickly moves from canter to a brisk gallop of shuddering metallic thuds and finger-clicks
when was last time you heard a song that ended with a mouth-trumpet solo or that paired lush pads with sound of a ilet flush probably never such goofy sound experiments are often avoided in worlds of house and ambient but andy wilson (aka andras fox) has no problem following his cheekiest impulses on self-titled debut from his latest alias said be literally an homage his fa r who apparently was a plumber and fond of hosing down his driveway also teases idea of dad house wards realm of dad jokes whats more striking than musics love of non-sequiturs however is how well it balances m with a remarkable sense of groove and casual beauty weird as wilson can get from track track hes never far from pure enchantment surely that dedication sublime carries over from records like overworld and embassy cafe where wilsons delicate musicality and transportive dance sounds trumped any o r inclinations and when those ideas are brought ge r with a wacky attitude and skipping funky grooves ir juxtaposition is even more engrossing its all produced with a newfound clarity and precision o tracks like and find wilson using his new dynamic best former floating seamlessly between swirls of synth and pop-locking beats while latter flips its titular sample every which way among slippery drum patterns cool chords and a plaintive clarinet that balance is less convincing on p o e t s which pairs a standard 4/4 rhythm with spritely string stabs and new age chimes heartfelt and carefree track is certainly charming and a fitting closer for eclectic but it doesnt lean in element of surprise that makes rest of record so enjoyable a similar argument could be made for and yet res something about downtempo piece that makes it stand out the ample space wilson arranges his track with from room reverb on a sharp-cracking snare and generous bass boom p synths lazy ping-pong and yes flushing water sounds is enveloping and rich pristine and pointed and it all flows so gently that by time beat disappears five and a half minutes in its impossible not be lulled by each disparate sound as it all unravels it started feel weird sampling from a culture that i wasnt a part of and something that o r people could do conceivably way better than me wilson ld ra in his 2014 breaking through profile and tackles that problem head on by returning his personal roots for inspiration and letting his gut instincts run wild (no matter how bizarre) wilson has built ideal home in which his music can grow
interdimensional transmissions new offshoot makes a great start with the ep from a well-regarded figure in the us techno underground vines output has been slow but strong (just one example is his killer remix of erikas gardeners released on it in late 20 3 ) begins with the blistering broken-beat title track its a forceful production geared for peak-time use thanks to a menacing bassline and relentless piston-like percussion but its expansively arranged and stuffed with details with a skittish melody surfacing in the middle the track is probably best when given some time to breathe in the mix a sprawling 4/4 cut is similarly nuanced but more restrained its better as a layering tool with a prickly treble and reverb-drenched chords lower down lastly theres four tense minutes of industrial drones and sky-on-fire ambience that tops off an excellent ep and one that instantly marks as a label to watch

re are large dollops of techno influences in s music the synths are spartan beats are red raw and a minimalistic approach is maintained throughout but nasser himself seems to think he makes house its addictive stuff nomenclature aside the romanian producers second outing for is an impressive and consistent package adopting a kraftwerkian rhythm is smothered in cavernous synths and dragged along by an odd bouncing bassline deep below the surface of lie indistinct subterranean beats while above ground theres clatter and a spattering snare/hi-hat combo that builds in intensity joined at every turn with more layers of percussion quirkiest of the quartet welds a metallic thwack to dreamy pads before the stoned title track rides in on a cloud of whirling synths heartbeat rhythms and a rattling percussion
tin man and gunnar haslam have at least one thing in common: their romanticism the former is admired for exposing the elegiac potential in that most overused of tools the 303 as for l i e s affiliate haslam you need only look as far as his bera range ep to see that he enjoys bit of soaring majesty as such you might be able to hazard a guess as to what the pairs debut collaborative release as sounds like and youd be right at least in part the chief attraction here is almost symphonic in scope a dense grid of percussion barely lets up for the duration but its the chords youre listening to a layered soup of pianos dub stabs synth strings and so on while a 303 (what else ) pings gently away in the foreground the overall effect is one of elegant angst (although the lengthy percussion-only coda feels unnecessary) glanum i is even more extravagant ditching the techno framework altogether to explore swooning synth-pop balladry its main flaw is that it doesnt go further the melody lines are crying out for a singer or at least some more full-bodied pop-wise production elsewhere things are little more muted at first s dissonant melodies suggest a bleak nocturnal techno number but the chords in the latter half confuse the mood finally glanum ii which features the same 303 line as its counterpart some lacklustre drums and nothing else feels like a slightly pointless addendum these two producers work best when playing to their mutual strength lets hear those synths weep
remakes of classic tunes are a mixed bag quite often they involve taking what made the original successful and adding a sound here a bassline there and voila sales based on hard work done ten or so years ago nd while recent times has seen some pretty good progressive remixes namely the innovative deadset remix of hybrid or the gerber remix of ubu you ve also got to take the good with the bad recent rethinks such as deadmau5 s remix of hybrid remixes of pete lazonby sacred cycles or tlas compass error leave you wondering why people bother s original was a melodic production with trademark mid 90 s string patterns and you guessed it epic breakdowns desyfer s remix draws inspiration from the original but splatters it with modern touches it has an older unrelenting feel to it and even takes a breather to introduce a mid 90 s piano breakdown late in the track ut overall it s a disappointment a trip down memory lane rather than anything startling or new the d dub mix on the flipside is a different story it s mean there are moments of happiness in it but for the most part it s angry despite the catchy peter hook feel to the main riff it doesn t sound dated or more importantly from the same planet as the original you can hear snippets of the original vocal sample scattered but that s where the relationship ends if the original was euphoria at 5 a m this is gritted teeth and clenched fists different kind of satisfaction sure but satisfaction all the same
fter taking a solid ten years off from his production game detroit beatdown maestro has been setting his gears back in motion since third ear reissued the journey in 2009 with strong releases for thema and dockside reinstituting him as one to watch the ep finds talley hooking up with londons for three slices of no-frills detroit goodness youre not likely to finding anything mind-blowingly innovative but it might surprise you how much tension talley can juice from these three simple grooves the epic ion is without question the eps strongest track with talley keeping a tight grip on a rhodes vamp thats poised to pull the leash right out of his fist the track recalls music made during talleys long break from production the far more boisterous double trouble by pied plat as featured on marcel dettmanns berghain 02 mix springs to mind but with a sort of confident restraint younger producers probably couldnt pull off rather than set the floor on fire ion gets it boiling one degree at a time the same goes for the title track whose saxophone melody guides us over a long bumpy road with the panache of a driver whos seen these potholes before nalog feels somewhat at odds with the eps forward motion with a voice asking that we grab hold of its hi-hats and rising bassline and go back way back regardless s tight grooves suggest theres much still to come from this veteran
great thing about is that y have had numerous s celebrate ir voluminous catalogue back when y were releasing a record every week things slipped through cracks as someone who wasnt buying records during ir heyday find it to be a valuable education bad thing about is that by and large s y pick to do so are remarkably unimaginative ok maybe its not ir fault what listens to every o r mix cd in a series be e doing ir own at same time though dont you think that someone somewhere might have also thought to put free set free or witch ktor on a compilation at some point s a celebration of a shared past sure but it also neglects all of wonderful things that has to offer thats why s s vol 5 comes as such a welcome surprise with as much love exotica soundtrack music as he does classic house matt edwards seems like ideal producer a trawl through labels back catalogue over course of two mixes he doesnt disappoint s timeless sets scene a downtempo r b tune which sounds lovely and normal aside from gremlins in background chanting rhythm things get even more strange from re with felix da housecat (as ) and silly putty synth line of and apologetic phone call hidden in edwards mix of s and pes some moments on more straight ward second disc it isnt always mixed as smooth as you might expect but you get sense that edwards has sacrificed perfect segues in order to fit in as many tracks as he can clearly he has a lot he wanted to say with vol 5 ; it wouldnt be two discs o rwise whats most interesting about each disc though is how easily you can hear first is him channeling his earlier more freestyle days with a number of mash-ups and left turns second is a heads-down tribal house update that grooves as hard as possible both are among most interesting label celebrations that has had in ages a testament to both its varied past and its enduring relevance in present day
dungeon synth is a subgenre of black metal that emerged in the early 90s but it didnt have a name until recently its most famous practitioner is burzum who worked depressive synth lines into his coarse black metal before making entire dungeon synth albums from prison where the only musical equipment he was allowed was electronic (in 1994 he was found guilty of murdering another musician ystein aarseth and burning down three churches ) music invokes medieval and fantastical themes and typically has chintzy horns strings and synth choirs mood can vary from funereal to wondrous one of the best dungeon synth acts from the 90s depressive silence made disarmingly pretty music but its usually dark and desolate dips its toes into the genre with the first release from abdulla rashim under his real name with predictably dark stone-faced results move into dungeon synth is a clever one for a label that has long used black metal aesthetics to underline its bleak style of techno and ambient linells take on the style sheds the medieval pageantry of well-known acts like wongraven in favour of bold synth lines melancholy melodies and icy atmospheres rudimentary effects like the reverb on help make the music feel cavernous and empty while small variations in tempo or arrangement such as the tentative rhythms of or the decorous synth strings of keep it from getting monotonous is a revealing look into the aesthetics and inspirations of one of modern technos most distinctive crews and for techno fans an introduction to the strange and sometimes silly world of dungeon synth album doesnt reach dungeon synths most melodramatic heights but its pleasingly grim and ominous fitting right in alongside recent releases from ulwhednar acronym and isorinne connecting the metal world to and vice versa expands the remit of a label that was already about all things dark and electronic without drifting too far from what made it great in the first place
though only four releases deep the label is well on the way to developing a distinctive aesthetic 12-inches from audio werner elgato and junes all took a minimal stance on house music displaying a lightness of touch a crisp sound palette and an understanding that invention can thrive in subtle details the labels latest from newcomer shares these values though the producer has a little trouble making minimalism work for him the meandering subaquatic synths and gentle offbeat snares of suggest an admiration for joey anderson the results are pleasant enough but hasnt quite nailed that sense of poise that makes a good anderson production so compelling ep is better it has that sense of cavernous space you get by emphasising the very low (a rounded kick drum a mooching bassline) and very high (layers of snare drum filigree) while in the midrange an understated hook just about pulls everything together still its only really that achieves liftoff its percussive framework is much the same but in place of muted atmospherics were given a lithe synth figure leaping and stuttering with pleasing unpredictability here the extreme simplicity of the arrangement heightens the tension rather than lessening it that its the s only instance of funk doesnt hurt either

so after the release of his debut great stuff album a thousand nights frankfurt producer and dj was named best producer the sec d year running by german magazine raveline in the following m ths though tresher limited himself various remixing assignments the likes of james flavour adultnapper delete and karotte as well as pulling the strings behind m ika kruses first album after being away from the limelight sees him coming back not ly with a new full length but also with his own imprint recordings but c trary what the labels name would want you believe treshers latest s ic incarnati s arent trying cover new grounds as much as capitalizing previous realizati s as the title suggests aims at telescoping the lively and animated with the technological and calculated from aphex twin and his computers having nervous breakdowns booka shade taking cues from both the sun and the ne lights it is e of dance musics most referred- clich s but unlike past ef ts tresher seems have a hard time here giving his producti s the vibrant physicality such an aim would entail sub-solomun tech house cuts such as and are o generic meet the standards he has accus med us ; when the album jumps the house and techno rails and starts playing with breakbeat motifs like album opener and it simply comes across as ill-advised and as c vincing as it is probably sounds o much like anth y rother its own good it isnt all mundane both the title track and instance are built around the type of ascending cascading melodies tresher ce gracefully displayed beatport chart- pper a thousand nights ; the latter even adds some ornamental pads that ly strengthen its vulnerable yet heartwarming feel album closer is even better succeeding at being both anthemic and delicate fact that these tracks are am g the albums l gest is telling: tresher is at his best when he allows himself take us the proverbial journey and takes time set the mood album also has at least e truly surprising moment: on tresher makes use of a vocalist enthusiastic effect its the type of electro house great stuff is known but it rec ciles it (albeit unsurprisingly) with the producers own 80s synth-pop roots a vein that tresher should clearly explore further in the future that said there is a certain air of immobility about most of the tracks leave you exactly where you started thus leaving you with the impressi that new grounds havent been broken after all
s / indicates that his forthcoming album will likely represent his more recent four-four direction has a pumping beat and ground-up rhythms mixed in with time-worn rave stabs sparkly ripples and some more unnerving flourishes which give it a definite edge the two versions of are based around almost identical synth patches that are voracious and industrial while some prettier ones flit around them the first version is according to a beatless exercise in the sound that made metalheadz with no kicks but a heaviness that would make it not out of place at peak time its usable as an interlude or a means to change your sets direction the second adds hollow iron kicks and a sort of misplaced humour in the giddy vocal hiccups theres plenty to keep you interested but in spirit theyre dance floor tracks that simply want to take control

following the release of his self-titled debut album in march and a recent appearance alongside marcel fengler and peter van hoesen at oiler room erlin olle holmberg k rounds out his biggest year to date with a 7-inch on eclectic parisian label theres a taut techy serenity on and the former with its tranquil palette of cosy pads and rocking chair drums leads neatly into the latter which places more of an emphasis on bassweight and groove unearths the eerier facets of s tastes as firefly synths dangle over the stormy foundations transporting you from twinkling pastures right through to sinister shadowy climes the ep is best listened to in full shining light on s subtle knack for building a mood
seem to be set on deconstructing their music: the thermal ep is four glossy retro-digital productions that fall apart at the seams on opener drums sputter in grooveless bursts and any semblance of melody is either insubstantial or directionless the other instrumental track has a more cohesive idea thanks to steady rolls of percussion that give the loose synthscapes and twittering fx some gravitational pull to swirl around the songs title is likely a reference to teengirls captivating debut lp 7 and the music uses dreamy warm-weather house sounds in much the same way as that record did thermal s two vocal cuts contrast similarly is spacious and impressionistic while is more straightforward with its sultry r b-isms regardless of form sound purposeful when writing songs for vocalists just as they did on efx the kelela-featuring highlight from 2012s tracer the problem here is that singers lafawndah and make for conspicuous kelela stand-ins and fail to forge their own identities from the airy coo of her voice or each others for that matter logan takahashis and nicholas weiss latest record arrives almost a full year after the solid nun ep reminded us why they were interesting in the first place but they seem to have spent the interim picking apart their past catalog instead of continuing to develop its good ideas
n m o is morten j olsen and rub n pati o olsen is a norwegian percussionist and a former drummer for moha while pati o is a spanish electronic artist affiliated with evol a veteran experimentalist who recently released on diagonal the pair have spent the last few years carving out a niche at the intersection of post punk and electronics releasing bristling but groovy jams with the forward motion of dance music and an experimental playful sensibility olsen and pati o introduce a new n m o side project on the b side of their latest 12 inch with every release n m o stands for something different (this time its nassau molasses office ) so probably wont mean deutsch am fuss the next time its used by the sounds of things olsen and pati o know d a f usually refers to deutsch amerikanische freundschaft the influential neue deutsche welle post punks who emerged in the late 70s the homage is also implied in their music but its hard to hear why the b side merited a new moniker there are some differences in its sound (mostly the addition of unintelligible vocal samples) but the energy is largely the same even with the boosted rave factor and bpm when there are shifts in the sound like for instance the chromatic tics of the untitled the energy stays steady the tracks are so well realized that it sounds like n m o could do this in their sleep at the same time it feels as though all their tracks fall under the same sonic umbrella
genius of time the duo of dorisburg and rkajo sure know how to work up a nice groove this shines best when their music is at its most reduced a style their home label has explored on recent releases henrik bergqvists renewal released one year ago was niara at its most restrained a hypnotic nod to 90s tech house with plenty of low-end punch then there was rkajos rymdkollo which wasnt afraid to let melody take a backseat to rhythm aims for bigger rooms but the straight-shooting groove remains its hard to look past the pumping b-side buoyed by a restless two-bar bassline it crescendos with a cascade of bright tones the melody is stripped away for a short passage halfway through after which things rebuild with even more verve like the rest of genius of times catalogue its sounds recall classic us house but everything else the sheen the lean arrangement is modern is more percussive the rhythm stutters underneath a looped snatch of vocal as drum rolls and techno stabs raise the intensity the massive bass injection two thirds through will get plenty of cheers but the more versatile is the real winner
next up on the always solid four twenty imprint is a tasty release from and his very chunky a release that has seen strong support from the likes of adam freeland james zabiela and lee coombs to name but just a few the original mix is quite a tasty piece of work with a devastating baseline as well as a nice funky vocal hook and gritty synth patterns the track has a real energy that never lets up from the word go the result is another sure fire hit from a very talented dj and producer the daniel taylor remix is quite a great piece of work too from a lad that is only 17 he delivers quite a mature remix on the flip with some gritty baselines and a cavalcade of tripped sounds and effects gritty and full of energy this is a remix that must be heard a very strong release here from four twenty with two very strong productions
s take on techno is esoteric and subaqueous with arresting samples and unusual field recordings dogs barking for instance capped off with provocative titles this clearly isnt your average club fare but most of it is made for dance floors its some of the most winsome experimental music around since debuting with a lush and hazy blade runner -referencing ep for eerie theres been a harder dystopic follow-up for new york haunted and the serene from the cloud our bodies for the artists new bene tleilax label ( ts another nod to sci-fi the labels name is from dune frank herberts epic novel ) is the rising talents most accessible release yet ideal for newcomers with a taste for the uncanny and live up their names the former is a gorgeous head trip with sunken chords and plush percussion designed to make you feel immersed and safe having drawn you in the latter switches the vibe with cascading synths and rolling drums that set a plaintive mood warm and dark tones then meet on like the sheen of oil on water ll n is the cryptic climax featuring sampled dialogue abstract textures and a shimmering melody that wafts over the top a typical move that leaves you suspended in mystery and eager for more
lives in music his decade-plus career has seen him collaborate with nic fancuilli as skylark work with pussycat dolls and kanye west build his own recording studio and in late 2008 go solo so far so good: chatterley has already had a much-loved radio 1 record ccess the future and launched the union of numbers project (month-by-month releases exploring different shades of electronica) nd the earth-shuddering may be his best yet is a brawny stew with a warm lunar sub-bass line and a punchy four kick thud that in its depth is immediately reminiscent of the darkest and most offbeat m_nus output noisy jets take off and land while a war-like siren makes you feel like youve breached the security at a military complex a supermarket announcement-style harmony of soothing rung chimes and synth pows work to relax the piece adding silky textures delete on the remix reduces the piece in size and stature opting to double-time the synth shots filling in the gaps with conga and toms quieting the sirens and jets to ambient background noise the infectious sub-bass groove is removed and the piece as a whole is slowed down a few pm it is essentially an anti-climax on the back of chatterleys destroyer what delete seems to forget however is that you cant make bombing sirens and jet streams laidback ll marks go to chatterley
2011s i can feel heat the one solo ep so far from la-based producer aka damon palermo was a joyous riot of chunky house whose big synth riffs and vocals were offset by a deceptively deft production hand is cut from exactly the same cloth with the title track pricking up the ears immediately through a high-pitched hands-in-the-air synth and a full-fat vocal from new york singer hangs on a ducking-and-diving bassline that with help from female vocal lines unexpectedly recalls robin ss show me love a sign if nothing else of the unashamedly populist house that palermo is exploring hinges on a soulful vocal snippet and an addictive old-timey piano riff that morphs into a supremely funky synth noodle fans of this style will struggle to find fault with anything on this full-blooded release
theres something endearingly modest about you feel like you know him just from reading his interviews his twitter account this unassuming quality seeps into his music: the bootleg remixes with which he made his name are mostly gentle touch-ups rather than total reworks his original songs have been marked by a preference for warm lived-in sounds (which has led to unfortunate tags like chill-trap) now after years of digital-only releases hemsworth has signed to canadian big dog for a full-fledged lp though packed with guest appearances is exactly the twee little package youd expect from hemsworth the albums opening track (featuring ) shows hemsworth as we know him best buffering his sickly-sweet melodies with exaggerated melodrama but after a theatrical drop it simply disappears in a puff of air most of the album feels like that; the talheadz-y the tragically short (featuring ) are mere trifles even more fleshed-out songs like vec seem slight at first but actually theyre thicker than their gossamer surfaces suggest: packed with layers of smoothly sculpted sound occasionally melting into a smear of affecting melody made mostly on tour in airports was reportedly an introspective experience for hemsworth he accordingly shies away from trendy pastiche sticking to his own signature set of sounds though he does throw in some big-ticket pop jams get an emo-rap canvas for the stunning closer young r b singer has a delicate bed of soft percussion trilling synths for lp highlight nd before you know it its over at just 36 minutes doesnt quite tell the full story of to get an idea of his impressive grasp of funk dynamics not to mention his sense of humour youd have to see him dj but as an outlet to show off his production skills isnt a bad place to start its quintessentially him stuck in the little world hes created nd there are worse places to be than his realm of video games rap music pop so sweet it tickles the back of your throat
turkey based label the deliver an interesting release here which sees two very solid progressive producers in subsky and muzo showcase their talents on one vinyl and it s a move i can tell you that pays off as we are presented with two very solid and different tracks with at least one side sure to please first up is it subsky with let it flow this is how progressive should be a very nice baseline gives the track a great funk throughout and it merges supremely with the tender melodies that ring in the foreground a nice broken beat breakdown midway sees more melodies emerge and it leads into the beats and grooves coming back in with great a great flow yet again muzo is on the flip with particular people and this production is on the whole quite subtle yet it is very smooth and groovy at the same time deep baselines unite well with constant drumwork as well as soothing string patterns the baseline does quite well to build the track throughout as it changes in shape and intensity and helps to create the overall journey like production must say i do quite like this release and for me it s been too rare to find such good progressive releases such as this i also must say that it is the a-side that shades it for me too as it is quite simply devastating

celebrate their 10th release with and his latest production on the a-side is the original mix the track begins with some solid tribal beats and a filtered vocal effect making subtle impacts the track builds with some effects and takes a nice breakdown midway in with some smooth strings and the vocal used to greater effect the track then gets into overdrive with the strings giving it a more uplifting feel as well as some twisted effects on the flip is the dub mix this track is as tough as nails with some tribal drums intertwined with a deep baseline and some eerie effects the track maintains a similar flow using the deeper and lower end sounds to greater effect a mid set churner not too bad a release don t expect a peak time stormer rather 2 tracks with some solid production mainly in the drums
s third record is a four track compilation its the imprints second such release following julys wolves which collected efforts from sawf and hound scales among others sticks to the format with (who also featured on the first compilation) and label founder m rbeck laying down one cut each s beatless title track takes up the and is a far cry from the pummelling techno has specialised in its haunting and emotive and its placement in front of three big room tracks is bold ukrainian newcomer supplies the most straightforward thing here where swing white noise and a vocal go combine for a track much in line with the heavily swung noisy techno sound those looking to go deeper should head straight for the b side m rbeck and offer up and respectively both hypnotic albeit slightly jarring cuts that thanks to a collage of violent mid and high range samples should stand out in any set
is a new offshoot of project squared which is run by paul cooper and gordon gieseking after a strong run of subterranean techno releases from the likes of and tom dicicco and kowton project squareds output has slowed in the last couple of years due to the diverging tastes of its founders in response cooper launched this new label as an outlet for his own tastes may hail from moscow but his releases follow that very british trend for conflating 2-step and techno moves on from the burial-lite of eps like easy changes the drums that swing through and now smack more of hessle than hyperdub the former especially has echoes of bandshells rise em with offbeat kicks sat beneath bursts of hi-hat and discordant strings the latter only maintains its four-to-the-floor pulse for brief flashes before the drums start to lurch like a ship in a storm this rhythmic playfulness is s strongest suit the techno stride of both with pitched-down vocals and static crackles and with rumbling subs and rim shots feel slightly lifeless in comparison
vlad radu is a romanian producer whos been aligned with some of the countrys key house and techno names for some time despite these connections he only just released his first solo record (hes appeared on a few compilations and a collaborative 12-inch before) the ep is worth the wait for the a-side alone on it youll find an original cut and a remix from dan both of which show two producers nailing the subtle streamlined sound theyve spent the past few years perfecting the records title track is its most playable tune it has many of minimals key hallmarks an elastic bassline quirky synth snippets a rolling groove which combine in a way that feels warm and positive dan s rework of is more subdued and sees him work with the same kind complex of broken beats that featured on his recent album for [a:rpia:r] blissful and meditative its another charming example of a trademark cosmic minimal sound on the b-side is less pleasant what sounds like a short violin sample is aggressively looped and matched with a booming kick drum this otherwise delightful ep wouldve been stronger without it
a difficult house ep im not talking about an experimental house ep an undanceable house ep or an ep whose contents is only debatably house but a house ep that might make listeners take a few steps back from the speakers (albeit steps taken precisely in time and with a certain bounce) and be like whoa i kind of cant believe im grooving to this right now home base for juju jordash loves putting out precisely this kind of material but s is one of the labels most interesting in part because its strangeness stands right in the middle of the dance floor the ukranian producer who has in no way been slacking off in offers up five tracks that arent uniformly flawless but which add up to one tantalizing whole the ep begins at its most gorgeous with peeling back layer after layer of the title track but stopping just short of the big reveal only hinting at the beauty hes capable of it seems this producer prefers this sort of coy almost-moment: on he keeps luscious pads in a cage of 303s lending their silkiness more than a hint of the sinister s sound palate overextends itself slightly on and a nina kraviz-esque stew of unmatching patterns and a skittering la-beat-scene-gone-schaffel quickie respectively but returns to form for ep closer wherein reimagines nu groove post-hyperdub its a pretty brilliant note to end on because feels more than a little like bobby konders rhythms an equally challenging ep with a penchant for throwing a wrench in our definition of dance floor appropriate
recently was out for a few beers with mates and we were chatting away about travels to here and there exchanging silly stories laughing at drunken tales disaster and reminiscing all about hapless adventures throughout the world talk inevitably turned to biza and course to c 0 upon the very mention the club the volume at the table rose at least decibels as we all burst alight with our circo loco experiences friend proclaimed he wasnt done with that dusty dance floor debauchery nother said he wanted to celebrate his 0th birthday at the club that parties like the apocalypse is hours away s went to buy another round beaming at the very thought dancing to deliriously with upside down sunglasses and a rubber chicken thought that no experience clubbing or otherwise could incite such incendiary passion for hedonism by the time got back to the table my friends were already talking about booking flights legendary circo [email protected] an biza day party at the end an airport runway that only opens on monday morning has turned dance floor delirium and debauchery into success over ten years its defined underground clubbing in biza growing steadily throughout the 00s to be the bright hedonistic center what the white sle was really all about helped populate the twisted deep house and minimal techno sound throughout the island and shifted the focus clubbing away from holy trinity pacha manumission and space to the monday doubleheader circo loco and cocoon nd as a result its ruffled a lot feathers a renegade club that threw up a sweaty middle finger to the mainstream and became outrageously successful while doing so but fate finally caught up with c 0 this season and it was shut down why who really knows maybe it was bizas new giuliani style mayor and his relentless crackdowns or the organized crime that controls all the clubs could have even been rival clubs paying the council f to sabotage their success whatever the reason another true clubbing icon like hacienda tresor and twilo before it is almost sadly extinct f its brief reopening for the rest the 08 season was to be its last hurrah (indeed it will be bar a miracle) then this ten year anniversary six disc behemoth deep druggy house du jour is even more essential if only for the true believers those unfamiliar with c 0 sound will be bemused at how such deep music can enthrall over a two hour set yet alone nearly nine hours those in the know understand its all about stamina at c 0 and these mixes require just that beloved resident alo boy j those romanian [a:rpia:r] upstarts and raresh the irrepressible and the sublime program a swirling subterranean soundtrack for a day in the dust more snapshot than retrospective its a mix that effectively puts you sonically at least right amongst the c 0 maelstrom s opening disc is a deep house leviathan o gravity marks out sparse but emotive territories playing at a sublimity lacking in the current crop deep house by the time she drops s 5 a succinct and menacing tidal groove grips and doesnt let go until the ketamine march s lumbers the set to close f exudes confidence in straddling relentless groove j falters and flatlines his set with a weak selection and some pretty uninspired mixing whooshes flicks gurgles and skitters mostly his own vinyl club tracks get a little cumbersome after an hour but there are some snippets magic like the brooding funk s and the closing bracket igglers and michael s which sprinkles black sonic tinsel through shafts summer sunlight romanias [a:rpia:r] posse are about where the chilean trio luciano villalobos and andy jack were a decade ago and their two discs are exemplary what c 0 is about at pm on a monday s a potent cauldron tech house that rarely simmers over but in the heat the berian monday madness would aptly ride along with you on whatever rollercoaster narcotics youve chosen res lots their own gurgling woozy productions and some real stormers namely s crisp techno cut and s puffed up deep house strut ups the tempo with a current best and brightest selection pumping minimal pivotally sending the tunes a little darker and meaner as if he was soundtracking the sunset; features twice ( has been on at least 4 comps in the last month easy people) and s flashes in brilliantly but the seductive monotony ot sends sweaty arms flailing best set all though belongs to veteran minimal hero his first recorded mix is a rich surreal journey into afterhours techno with the aplomb a master riding on a murky crest shuffling percussive house he pirouettes with ease through s spooky and skeletal pe to skills and his pumping dark techno stormer before sending heads splintering through the balmy berian night with s sparkling pray to the clubbing gods regularly that they may save our beloved c 0 for the world will be a poorer place without it now though just put this mix on grab your iors and imagine youre shoulder to sweaty shoulder with a thousand people from around the world screaming and dancing like its about to end
decon/recon 2 is the work of four artists paula temple rrose a sha devi and s s gunver ryberg collaborating on an unusual enterprise temple launched the decon/recon series nearly two years ago to release music without the scrutiny and egocentrism authorship can encourage each track on decon/recon 2 was produced using a pool of sounds drawn from every contributor regardless of who pulled these sounds into shape or who supplied them temple rrose devi and ryberg are given equal credit on decon/recon 2 emotions seem to contradict each other underneath the weaponised bass drums of the vocals are serene and hymn-like for a record with so much raw power a widescreen techno track with gorgeous atmospheric swells evokes a unique feeling of protection like a shelter in a storm these contradictions define decon/recon 2 sewn in various ways the contrasts enhance the eps central theme by fusing distinct yet complementary personalities so consistently decon/recon 2 has an appealing unity
boss mv (martin villeneuve) is up next on the release schedule with featuring the stereomovers in vocals and remixing both are no stranger to each other with numerous releases from the stereomovers being remixed by martin himself mv s tribal fusion mix is a smooth house track utilising vocals and guitar hooks nicely along with groovy percussion subtle basslines and smooth vocal effects allow the track to go deep in parts but when the guitar hooks and samples come in the sound takes on a housier feel a nice big breakdown gives way to the percussion and swirling sounds as the track builds into the beat and vocal very smooth and well done the stereomovers i am a star mix takes things into deeper territory accompanied by a touch of toughness soothing sustained sounds float over a tough beat and great percussion the vocals are heavily effected and fits with this sound nicely the first breakdown introduces an infectious low melodic riff and works well with the low sustained sounds the vocals feature throughout giving you that something extra to listen and bounce along to great remix moving over to the original the tone takes on a new look with solid beats drifting sounds and tough percussive work the dribbling of high end sounds along with squelches and low basslines keep this track firmly in the deep while the vocal flows over in its moody fashion moving into the business end of the track more quirky sounds area added alongside the guitar sample but let s not forget the inclusion of a nice piano-like melody mv and tao can t do too much wrong at the moment with a sling of releases since tao s inception in 2003 the quality has been high this release is solid in every aspect while everything falls into place with each track cementing their own sound another great release

its clear that the label founded by regis and james ruskin is seeking a unique identity it launched last year with a rather grandiose mission statement: we are not here to advocate religion but rather to advocate visual symbolism to question what is the here and now reinterpret themes in our own image the first couple of releases were promising if slightly predictable sicario de dios by and svreca (as s/ss) was a pair of rugged techno tracks and two shorter drone pieces packaged with a spectacular mix cd james ruskins 02 was stark bracing techno the romantic artwork and manifesto felt out of proportion to records that were largely dj tools hard hitting and expertly produced tools but functional nevertheless but with the third and fourth releases by and oliver ho (debuting his new alias) a distinct aesthetic looms into view on s bandon a vivid synth melody rises and descends converging with a meaty kick drum pattern into a thrilling groove muffled vocals pads and sticky feedback dot the track the effect equally sinister and euphoric powells reconstruction is aptly named as its effectively a new track s with so much of his suicide inspired music the remix strikes the right balance between muscular funkiness and mangled distortion in powells hands the central synth of the original becomes a shimmery flourish while walls of feedback and decaying drums swell and subside allowing the raw bassline to take centre stage s oliver ho shares powells obsession with post punk and no wave on 04 s opening track the mood is foreboding rather than funky as sombre guitar lines scattered drums and dark ambience stretch in all directions on and hos deadpan spoken vocal is an apt complement to the hulking grooves sounds precision tooled its thundering bass and deft percussion forming neatly with hos monotone delivery void gapes beneath the surface of both eps giving tangible form to the labels identify
since his 2009 innervisions single the bright forest announced him to the worldwide house community south africas has been on the ascent hes released music on an variety of labels and played gigs around the world his sound plumbing deep house while also exploring tribal timbres specific to his home was a breakout year for him as his ambitious second album washa showed that he wasnt afraid of working across a wider canvas conceiving of an 80 minute epic that wove a post apocalyptic folkloric tale into his deep house rhythms on the day of its release the album hit 2 on itunes in south africa just behind beyonc s lemonade suggesting that had become one of the biggest dance music names in his home country he now caps the year with the 21st entry in watergates mix series comprising four exclusive tracks mixed in with other exclusives from newcomers like and its at times thrilling but bogs down at crucial points the mix starts strong ominous and queasy bells introduce s admans though he lets in glints of light with well timed cymbals and a church organ drone that blooms into a rising chord progression but by the time we get to the pace starts to lag s synth strings and echoing tribal chant add texture but dont move the mix forward thankfully mes thumb piano laced brings the energy up the mix wanders off again with two tracks in the middle of the mix takes two minutes to develop though it builds to a clanging thrilling peak before plunging back down into again takes a winding path towards a peak scattering cymbals at random intervals before finding a coherent beat the canned claps give way to a lurching tom roll and the nagging guitar lick and wordless vocal of s the knocking wood that drives s dribbles to an almost complete stop by the time of carefully paced its as melodramatic as an ennio morricone score but it dampens the effect of the last two tracks s with its cool claps and swelling keys has a slow but nifty beat that leads directly into s vibraslap roto toms double picked guitar and a shaker laced house beat rattle around the track converging to send the mix out on an upswing but beneath the rhythm the keys exude a calmness that slowly comes to the fore to where it even sounds like crickets rise into the mix while fluctuates in terms of pacing and energy resolves it all with a fitting closer
struck gold with last years essential herbert remix collection secondhand sounds and now theyve turned their attention to electronic maestros plaid the duo are one of warps best selling acts behind only the aphex twin and have long been praised for the quality of their interpretations on other peoples music thei electronica is a pure combination of treble and bass lines with repeated listenings opening up the textures further sometimes the clarity is almost baroque like in nature with shades of bach in their remix of sensoramas zone 30 other times the music contains an infectious folky flavour as in the coba track after dinner the vocal tracks here are sublime particularly bjorks all is full of love nicolettes sinister no government and goldfrapps utopia all are given the distinctive plaid treatment resulting in some tracks that are better than plaid originals much to the pairs frustration if i could take one track to the desert island it would be dropshadows disease fototienda with its intricate layered sounds a sonic delight
washington d c s - ( aron leitko and mike petillo) may have temporarily made the jump from future times to but their sound hasnt changed one whit: were still talking clattery roland tr units unvarnished analog synthesizers and a jammy real-time sensibility programmed on machines rather than bricked together in bleton that finds common cause with retro-futurists like legowelt gets off to a stumbling start with an uneven bassline nosing through flanged hi-hats and syncopated claps but it soon assumes almost epic proportions with gleaming pads sketching a sad stately melody thatll stay with you long after the track has ended is more convoluted with a meandering melody that brings to mind the kind of bedroom synthesizer funk you might find on a private-pressing lp from the early 80s nominally 4/4 the latin-tinged rhythm has a strange kind of shuffle with shakers and rimshots lending a rushing hiccupping groove finally is a misty-eyed slow-motion electro-funk number; if michael mann ever made a film about a romance gone sour this would be a perfect fit for the melancholic climax
founded midway through last year seth troxler and the martinez brothers is said to be a label of cultural heritage which they set up to release music solely by african-american or hispanic producers its fifth release is by an apparently well-established berlin producer working under a new alias the subtlety and unhurried confidence of certainly suggests the hand of someone who has long since earned their production stripes it stutters to life with bass notes stalling and turning in on themselves like a faulty engine before an almost percussive african vocal and some steady hats add forward momentum to the brew a low-slung rockabilly-ish bass guitar comes in mid-track an unexpectedly welcome entrance it retreats almost as suddenly as it appeared leaving the track to creak to a close with only a dub mix on the b-side isnt giving away much at this stage but is enough to whet the appetite for whatever comes next
the very talented returns to scene with a nice release here on the features 3 new tracks from the young producer that follow on from his fantastic ep on the border community imprint freak love is first up and the track slowly builds with some nice acid riffs and very chunky kick drum the track progresses and the beats and riffs get heavier shortly before it breaksdown and introduces a eerie vocal hook that introduces the beats back in the track doesn t really take off as such but it remains smooth and interesting throughout untitled acid is next up and it is quite a stunning production nice crisp beats build the track amongst a sea of smooth sounds and lovely string patterns not to mention nice acid hooks and subtle vocal samples definitely a stunning highlight of this ep everyday balloon follows on the b-side with some eerie vibes thanks to some nice moody pads and crisp and intricate beats the acid lines in this production are bouncy and melodic and work very well with the smooth sounds that surround it this is another lovely piece of work by a producer that can seem to do no wrong
following in the wake of need u (100 ) and got u his two sun-kissed number-one singles this third instalment of s for club play only series feels like a move to reassert his underground credentials listening to the four stripped-back cuts here makes those huge chart successes seem all the more surprising although the bass-led ominousness of would fit in the sets of many edm djs links a lascivious repeating vocal line with off-kilter keys and bass to produce a functional but somewhat uninspiring club cut is more interesting pitting a similarly moody musical backing against an infectious and grin-inducing scat vocal unsurprisingly is a percussion-only dj tool its succinct hail of elasticated toms kicks and claps are the eps standout for me though i suspect the hardcore fan in your life may disagree

is associated with a certain kind of techno loud visceral and exactingly scientific but label boss s debut album doesnt completely fit into that particular pigeonhole fittingly the remix ep hes commissioned to precede it isnt your typical sa affair either: none of the producers here have a prior association with the label and the remixes feel livelier than the usual pitch black material tommy s remix of is an expectedly noisy thing primitively carved from misshapen rock its jagged edges landing with a disconcerting bounce like boulders tumbling down a cliff it lacks the extreme noise of his recent productions keeping the abrasiveness in check but its brute force renders it the simplest remix here peter goes for the jugular with his big-room remix of lav loaded up with massive kicks an elastic grumbling bassline and ethereal pads that glow in and out of earshot truss focuses on stilted loops with his rework of releasing energy by carefully unraveling tightly-wound bundles of arpeggiated synth british producer james steals the release however with a stunning and clever take on that stays closest to the albums spirit of stately idm influence throws a complex and winding breakbeat out into a gaseous atmosphere faint pads and synths conspiring around it in icy breezes s track travels through dimensions from prickly to austere to soft-footed a journey that makes for one of the finest moments in techno in so far shows that the usually perfunctory remix ep can be something more meaningful with just a bit of decent a r and that is not as single-minded as some critics have made it out to be
since day one this portugeese imprint has consistantly put out refreshing music on a underground tip from the likes of minilogue adf moshic nikki b christian effe and now on their seventh release feed me records introduce us to russian duo the comes with two original tracks along with a tasty rehash from chris micali first up is raven gipsy which comprises of funk tinged bassline and tech house percussion that begin to set the flow while interspersed with tweaked spacial sounds while this is taking place slight rhythmic changes and sublte development of the melody keep up the groove as things progress the tech angle is kept up with constant working of tepid synthlines along with a neat spoken word vocal next comes air which is possibly the most exciting track blending pulsating basslines with eriee meldioc undertones that ease the emotion forward before breaking down briefly and rolling on with a warm atmospheric vibe this isnt rocket science but sometimes its the simplist ideas that can be the best - dark tech beats with all the feeling behind a progressive number locked up inside the remix falls in the hands of chris micali who takes parts of the original raven gipsy and starts by chunkin up the beats gradually building up percussive elements and adding lengthy delayed fx that seem to bubble underneath as the track begins to blossom midway through the pace is kept at maximum as constant sounds lurk in the backround as ever so slowly an hypnotic synthline filters up and re-enforces the energetic groove
one label that has been very impressive of late is and they return with another winner in the form the by this is the follow up to the stunning 007 release by grand resonant which got massive play from danny howells in particular mikael tronic works his magic on the a-side with lapasenmieli a track which is arguably the most impressive of the ep the track begins with an eerie atmospheric soundscape and tough synth stabs with some quirky and strongly arranged beats joining the party soon in the track builds with some effects sharply attacking the production while the drums keep jumping from place to place the eerie strings soon make their way back again taking the track to its peak resulting in one of the most impressive tech tracks i have heard all year excellent stuff on the flip is firstly logic by grand resonant a pretty intense production this track delivers the goods with a pounding baseline and intense drum patterns swirling effects ride the background of thus techno arrangement but all in all this track is designed for the late set peak time moments the beats slow down on the b-side with traffic g s dronosphere quite minimal in its approach the track builds with subtle effects in the background and a deep pounding baseline cheeky little melodies and effects also feature as the track flows and despite its minimal approach there is a great substance to this track a great release out of the european studios for resonant with 3 very unique tracks for the label that follow up a great release with another quality ep
al dobson jr s full length debuts two records that landed in june 2014 one of which inaugurated the label were stuffed with scruffy and scrappy rhythms that distilled hip hop detroit beatdown house and beyond into bite sized chunks y flew by in a scorched summer haze and because they were so brief withstood practically demanded repeat listening on dobson jr s third album rye lane volume ii iii the tracks are once again short but with 28 tunes stacked together the record blends into one muddled mass of tumbling toms grubby kicks and muttered vocal musings might all sound like a day spent with the producer hanging out in his neighborhoods collage of cultures influences and ideas but that collage can be overwhelming had a third of dobson jr s similar sketches been cut rye lane would have been a more manageable trip south london resident is a master percussionist a sample digging hound and deft with an mpc and his music skips effortlessly through heartbroken house afro blues and sun drenched soul s authentic richly layered stuff thats endearingly earthy and ramshackle each style is as well executed as the next which is why tracks like the eglo influenced and with its rubbery bass plucks and zoned out bird calls feel all too brief re are countless examples of inventive little grooves and noteworthy chords that with further exploration could have made a bigger impression dobson jr excels in small doses but rye lane s endlessly jumbled aesthetic and penchant for brevity can obscure his abilities
s first ep is sort of like another debut myths evaporate from last year both artists handle familiar ideas with a clarity and precision that makes them fresh for south londoner myth it was garage via early zomby new orleans is a little more torn in their loyalties: s six sparse tracks criss-cross the atlantic the uk connection is grime riffs on the much-riffed-upon sinogrime and gets away with it through restraint its pentatonic bell-chimes are kept on a tight leash the bass pulses are stark and clinically precise is a more unusual hybrid pairing whipcrack beats with billowing dub techno chords but its the us rap-influenced tracks that best showcase s finely calibrated minimalism opener is dead-eyed and lethal its kicks scuffing up whorls of metallic delay on the title track with its pianos and ghostly synths and with its background choirs a sly romanticism starts to peek out none of it exactly dazzles but its never dull either only beatless closer is misjudged: its farty close-voiced chords linger for a couple of minutes too long
drew lustman has never been good at sticking to one style of music both under his given name and as faltydl among myriad other aliases the new york producer dabbles in everything from garage and techno to breakcore and idm his most recent album the crystal cowboy zeroed in on jungle twisting the genre together with jazz rap and other off-the-wall ideas on lustmans first record as for his blueberry label that experimental streak yields six tracks that are said to have been inspired by afxs hangable auto bulb eps pure braindance fun as lustman describes it and while those parallels can be found in its unruly playfulness and rich melodicism the music needs no outside context to make a resounding impact sounds like the kind of record lustman has been trying to make for a while one thats eclectic to the point of nearly skirting genre altogether a track like loops in elements of electro acid and idm without ever picking a favorite while blends punchy machine funk and bright airy ambience does glitchy electronica with a glowing grace and yet for all its diversity works as a whole thanks to lustmans bold sound design and infectious energy the differences between s percolating ascension and the percussive insanity of are many but their untethered otherworldly spirits make for complementary contrasts like the iconic artist who inspired the ep lustman sounds most natural following his every whim to its weird and unpredictable conclusion
in music no point of origin is ever quite as fixed as it seems you can hear an eerie pre-echo of techno in delia derbyshires 1960s recordings; in 1982 charanjut singh used a roland tr-808 and t -303 to create a style that uncannily anticipates the sound of acid house born a world away just a few years later nd in 1968 terry riley might be said to have invented the disco edit when he extended youre a three-and-a-half minute soul jam by the harvey verne dozen into 20 delirious minutes of panned phased noise-funk mayhem that early remix is the subject of a new cover version by the quartet of drummer charles hayward (this heat) guitarist john coxon (spring heel jack spiritualized) keyboardist pat thomas and hot chips lexis taylor its a surprisingly faithful cover following rileys changes more or less to the letter as it dissolves into shambling bluesy psychedelia the kind of thing that wouldnt sound out of place at onnaroo if its a clever choice of repertoire their pick to remix it is pure genius more than any other house producer theo evokes rileys radical cut-and-paste aesthetic in his own remixes that said its difficult to identify anything from s version in his interpretation set in a different key boasting new vocals and a shuffling house groove that bears little resemblance to the originals elastic rhythm perhaps thats why its subtitled theo rather than remix in any case its as satisfying as anything has produced in the past couple of years worrying away at a curious cadence spry and slack all at once while organ riffs and vocal loops uncurl around it hazy and humid it morphs over the course of its nine minutes as gradually as a bank of thunderheads its a fitting fascinating play in the songs decades-old game of chinese whispers

he might have had a hand in some 19 albums but andrew atherall rarely works alone keith tenniswood (in two loneswordsmen) to gary burns and jagz koone (as sabres of paradise) the best chapters in this auteurs proud discography are results of collaborative partnerships as he pairs off with timothy j fairplay a cohort from the near mythical scrutton street studio where the likes of fellow analogue alchemists death in vegas and daniel avery also do their dirty do resulting partnership gives rise to music that is a gauzy coal-stained mesh of various guitar genres all married to a chugging electronic beat and dub-wise swagger ruled by passion destroyed by oozes a proudly dour britishness not least in its literary wit (just look at the title) tracks like are happy to be punky and anarchist whilst referencing fogeyist poet john betjeman of the highlights is the haunted minutes where atherall sings the titles refrain amongst a turbulent brew of shakers claps and filthy down-low guitar riffs for the most part the shoreditch skulduggery atherall so often references has clearly permeated the walls of his studio tracks like predatory prowler are dense with smog guitars are laden with post-punk bile and the tortured dark wave synths are frazzled beyond repair it all adds up to a tense dramatic listen at all times you know this is an album made by the producer who drenched screamadelica in so much e but it also bares all the hallmarks of fairplays fine solo experiments in apocalyptic disco scuzzy and roguish the results may be but they sure do tell a fascinating story and all without ever breeching a seedy 115bpm
jesse tijns early releases for pennyroyal and others were raucous and unpolished almost to a fault (the title of his turbo new jack comp contribution the anti-mixdown is telling) but in the year or so since his music has been getting increasingly slick the flat ep for wncl was in service to slinkier more refined grooves with this single for he returns to the remorseless stomp that made tracks like fucklebucks such a delight but the improvement in his technique is remarkable all the better to deliver his excoriating payload the claps and hi-hats on are positively crisp while in the middle distance bruised synths loop and interweave with machinelike precision the way the thing grows and brutally grows is difficult to fault; its fearsome forward momentum owes a debt to 90s surgeon is more vivid and more fun largely due to the vertiginous pumping synth at its core but where previously tijn might have revelled in the silliness of his materials here he remains steely in his resolve in fact silliness is whats lacking here and tijn fans may mourn its passing but only briefly past tijn singles had instant shock factor on their side but these tracks should enjoy a longer life on the dance floor
every time i play it people start to do some crazy things and crazy screams says the reactions have been absolutely good its easy to see why is a heavy kicking techno-house hybrid that uses a glitchy 8-bit gaming console loop as its centerpiece and unyielding rolling percussion that really does the damage the nathan remix follows the original closely with most of the same sounds given only a slight re-sequence its a tougher mix but hardly deviates from the blueprint b-side is an adventurous submarine excursion built around a startlingly weighty kick drum this coupled with periscope bleeps and breathing apparatus exhalations really give the aural impression of being at a party 20 000 leagues under the sea jules verne will chart the remix is by ocelot who ed bangers it up delivering a big ravey piece that the fluro kids will sweat to both originals are overflowing with energy and will definitely be club bombs and the remixes are sure to find admirers too whether is on his techno tip or making his synthy deep stuff he is always on point and hes come up trumps again here with this release
even as techno moves in and out fashion i dont think has anything to worry about the drummer-turned-producers intricate textural maps clicking beats and chiming chords defies trends with his laborious constructions venturing through unpredictable tangents or breaking out into jazzy sections res a feeling constant movement and shaky energy that means his music never quite stands still it was a mula that he perfected with his single-track ep the make up the break up a stunning lesson in subtle buildup and release ty minutes gentle lapping and ebbing that never less worked up enough energy to break out into occasional streaks blinding sunlight this practiced and confident manner extends itself to pronsatos third album sounding assured where his darker previous album why cant we be like us ten sounded like it was mired in its own emotional frustration with evocative track titles and moving melodies doesnt seem any less melodramatic yet its more coherent an easier album-length listen pronsatos sound isnt as earth-shattering this time around but its not about shock and awe: has a way slowly enveloping a space until everything else just feels inconsequential the record begins in typical fashion with nt a rolling boil snares and vibes that melt and splinter on impact ever-present drama underpinned by orchestral flourishes that loom underneath choppy sea from re on out though its not quite business as usual: pre-album single centers around a surprisingly straight ward mallet riff subtly shifting its atmosphere but carefully keeping its centre in those dulcet tones its b-side also makes an appearance on album a late-album pick-me-up and straight club jam unlike anything else steven ford has made under pronsato name in years bristling with a tech house insistence that feels almost defensively simplistic ford also sometimes sticks to his usual tricks its hard not to be absolutely thrilled with result though: trio-out seems disappointingly standard until its completely saturated by innumerable drum fills rich realistic sounds that dot soundstage like twinkling stars fords best however comes when hes out his com t zone juggles and fumbles with all sorts springy and squeaky sounds like some moss-grown version oversteps -era autechre its only point on album where ford sounds like hes just making it up as he goes along but idm-esque abstraction fits him to a tee casting his sometimes difficult music in a new light thats much easier to understand is kind compulsive and meticulous refinement youd expect from someone who makes music like ford does perhaps with exception his pristine and beloved drums every sound no matter how tiny is endlessly tweaked and picked apart thats what hes always done: sprawling epics from pin drops and brushed snares an endless search something constantly out reach hell probably never get re but closer he gets luckier we are to witness him searching is closest yet
when i think about kris wadsworth i think about his killer djing and sleazy sense of humour more than i do his productions both qualities shine through on the first release for his new label which presents two grubby collaborations from lesser-knowns in wadsworths hometown of though neither is particularly mind-blowing both have a satisfying crunch to them like they crawled out of a sewer and couldnt shake the muck off re-wet comes from (who helps run how to kill and local heat) with some help from young producer its the more energetic of the two with a taut strut and handclaps that land like slaps in the face most of the melody comes from basslines that shudder and growle add in some unintelligible pitched-down voices and it sounds as if it can barely stay together takes charge on the flipside for slowing the pace to a creepy stalk his cut is funkier and a bit more confident but a bit leery too with insistent baritones that sound like slurred come-ons from some drunken punter you could see how it would be fine fodder for a wadsworth set
the working title of dimitris dimas forthcoming album is rejoice which should tell you all you need to know about the tone of his music the athens producer debuted on last year with the skyway ep a six-track statement of intent whose sample-led house style certainly didnt swim against the current what set it apart was its unfailing breeziness; even weirder moments had a bright fluffy quality that made for very pleasant listening for its followup the two-track dimas plays things straighter this turns out to be a bit of a mistake pitches for a steely techno vibe the clipped interlocking chords are nice enough but dimas doesnt quite have the production chops to pull off something so straitlaced as a result it occupies a frustrating halfway house not rough enough to be endearing but not full-bodied enough to sit alongside techno-proper is a partial return to gauzier terrain its muzzy rave chords bell tones and twitching beat evoke blissy 90s hardcore in a manner similar to lone theres an oddly subdued quality to it all however which means you might find your attention wandering before the four minutes are up
have been shuttling around colognes electronic music scene for over a decade but their only previous release as a duo came two years ago with a slice of house leaning juke on a compilation from colognes lting pot music it suggested they took an almost unhealthy amount of influence from machinedrum looks much closer to home for inspiration namely the uk bass continuum truth its only moderately successful but thats not to say there arent signs of real promise these dont appear on though its elastic bassline and bouncy neo uk garage rhythm may have you checking the calendar to see if youre back in 2012 hades solo effort still contains some bashmoreisms but it fairs better mainly thanks to a charming combination of fluttering hi hats and emotive stabs the highlight is although even then the hit isnt an immediate one three minutes into a pleasant if conventional bass leaning house jam drop everything and introduce a rich rhodes phrase when the beats return the bassline has emerged as something complex and beautiful
drifting from start to finish is like slowly getting pulled down a drain only it isnt your physicality that moves but rather the world around you and somehow your intangible being with it while the journey is strange enough there is also an air of mystery around the origins of : the original discogs entry used to link to an obscure 70s artist on polydor now corrected there is no information at all whereas the official website only reveals drones for bleeding hearts ( n addition there have been a host of different versions of on different labels including cassettes and limited 7-inch reels ) sonically you can draw comparisons between what labels like type and kranky often suggest but none of them fully explain the opening movement sounds like leyland kirby covering godspeed you black emperor in slow motion while the second is cavernous and darkly angelic somewhere in the middle of this continually evolving album of modern classical/drone the continuum breaks into grainy strains of real music a classical waltz then church music that sounds as if its coming from another room until it all fades to grey there is a feeling of being watched as the climax slowly approaches perhaps it is the inkling of spirituality in the distant bells and the edge of voices as they slip away the fear that there might be something else out there fires a desperate but futile escape as waves of drones reach a crescendo eventually the reverie is broken but because its such a captivating and powerful work youll likely want to get dragged right back into it yet again

has released most of his music on lobster theremin and its techno sub-label m rk but from the start it could have been on say gieglings forum sub-label the amsterdam-based producers dub techno has always been harder and heavier than the rest of lobsters catalog so its no surprise that hes ventured elsewhere there was a tender trance ep on the new transatlantic label and now fits neatly among s weighty dub sounds s tracks are emotional bombs buoyed by deep delayed kicks and a cloak of ethereal ambience on with its ancient and unearthed feel the pads haunt like hymns while pendulum drums swing heavily below the title track is as heavy but less stirring its drums thudding through nine minutes of stormy atmospheres a drumless stretch of shy bass tones glowing chords and innocent melodies is only half of s usual recipe of all the eps dreamy moments this track has the most mystique

next up on the mighty is another release from with a release that one must say is quite superior to their recent release on the same label is the track and it is quite a nice funky electro affair the original mix is quite a highlight in this release as it begins with some smooth drum patterns and a smooth rolling baseline soon enough the nice electro synth baseline wobbles come into the track accompanied by the dark vocal that gives it a bit of a creep feel in total though it is quite a funk fuelled production the bangor d mash d mix follows and essentially it is an accapella of filtered synths vocal effects and random touches on the flip is firstly da dub keeping the electro touches out of it this track focuses on the deep baselines and vocal effects as well as the nice crisp drum patterns however deep into the track we see new elements emerge with a gritty electro edge introduced to spice things up not bad at all but not as jackin as the original the mckenn-apella follows which is another dj tool that mostly uses the vocal as well as some eerie sounds and atmosphere another pretty solid release from cuba with the a-side in particular through the original mix providing the main highlight
finnish veteran s ep comes just a month after a new album of sparky subterranean electro-pop gleaming arps signpost as a quality homage with a liquid bassline and john foxx-like vocal that like a lot of hulkkonens best work strikes a fine balance between bubblegum and dystopian moods daniel and j e e p s remix heads from dance floor to lounge the added pitter-patter of bongos and twanging guitar notes are pleasant but its altogether less compelling than the original b-side is an unremarkable future-pop plod its robotic vocal bringing to mind international deejay gigolos compilation filler circa 2001 hulkkonen perhaps should have dropped the song it wouldve made for a better record
side a original the original recording of throws you straight into the deep end with a great body moving bass line the atmospheric distorted vocal which drops in midway through the track adds to the building sounds as the fairly simple (yet powerful) breakdown pushes you over the edge and keeps it flowing side b remix the original as great as it is really gets overshadowed by this deeper and darker remix it features a dirty basement kind of ambience behind the bass-line and from here it just gets tougher the already shaking bass line out of nowhere begins to get stronger and what was already a solid beat gets the push that makes it sound that much better this remix is stripped of the vocal from the original but you really don t miss it both of these mixes will work great in the right environment and it definitely ranks as one of the best productions to date from jamie stevens manuel sharrad and frank xavier it is a great release for both the trio and adam freeland s label it features all of the trademark electric party sounds that these wollongong boys have become famous for and is nothing but a great release
up next on hooj is with following from the very impressive rj release number 135 in the hooj discography consists of some smooth solid house music with a killer main melodic riff that will hook you from the word go disc one on the a-side is precinct s dharma dub the track begins with some chunky drums and a deep and subtle baseline that slowly builds in the early stages a bouncy baseline soon enters the fray giving the track a great flow that seems to increase with intensity the main melodic riffs soon make their presence as the track also builds again with another layer of deep baseline rumbles as well as wailing vocals that ride over the production the track takes a momentary break deep in that sees the main melody make another appearance then leaving the production to drive its way to the conclusion a very good beginning to this release on the flip is the instant mix this mix starts with the beautiful main melodic guitar riffs and soothing vocal of freakboysoul the beginning of this track is delightful as beats come in and out all while sounds flow smoothly in great harmony a deep and cluttered baseline is then slowly introduced which gives the track that extra oomph the guitar melodies soon gain intensity midway into the track a stage of the production that soon welcomes the finale where all the sounds of the guitar vocals baselines and drums merge in true style a delightful mix disc two firstly on the second disc is the saul o sage mix from the word go the kick makes a strong impact while the acoustic elements juggle around the production the track makes great use of a droning sound effect that rides the drums well and also sees the melody and vocals work in great unity a killer baseline is introduced midway into the track that really gives this production that extra level a subtle high pitched string pattern also features late in another great remix on the b-side is hawke s blue resurrection mix beautiful soothing strings begin the production with a solid 4/4 beat pattern the vocal gets a great working as the baseline in this remix is just as devastating as other mixes the track builds in delicious style as the main melody is introduced midway in and then the vocal makes another impact the track builds and builds while elements are introduced at will this quite simply is another stroke of genius by gavin hardkiss the master veteran in production another very impressive release from the lads at hooj it is safe to say that all 4 mixes are very impressive and it is especially good to see classic producer gavin hardkiss still at his impeccable best
: is he the great young detroit hope judging by the raves hes gotten from the likes of rick wilhite omar s and mike huckaby and more importantly the music thats come out thus far im inclined to think so s productions have the sort of queasy funk associated with the likes of latter day parrish a brand of organic house music that is delicate beautiful and hard as hell to mix (according to o himself) s second release for his own imprint is no exception side a collaborative track done with a group called nymle which includes the recently deceased son of mp fiddler moves along as if by sheer will groups ramshackle production is loose meandering and free with fiddlers sure handed drumming giving room for keyboard solos from that sound as potent and as gloriously indulgent as any guitar god turns up by himself on the other side dropping weird science over and former grooves like a fart y hip hop track in a good way slowly unraveling its abstract wares while the latter gets even stranger in pushing its keyboard loops out from underneath a mess of sonic floatsam composed of other miniature keyboard and percussion loops somehow though keeps both together forcing the weirdness to work with the beat or productively against it whatever it is it sounds different: nd thats a very good thing
everyone knows about everything richard d james told philip sherburne in an interview published on pitchfork last week the holy grail for a music fan i think is to hear music from another planet which has not been influenced by us whatsoever james doesnt come from another planet his productions take in techno uk rave avant-garde classical jazz prog rock pop and plenty else besides but for over two decades has brought us about as close to music outside of music as we can hope to get and its indeed made him a revered figure to fans of all stripes theres the old adage that feigning disinterest is the surest path to irresistibility but i dont buy that jamess squirrelly persona his hermit-like semi-anonymous existence his gruff interview technique his stanched flow of material since 2001s near-inscrutable double album drukqs is at the heart of his appeal i think it comes from the pleasure of hearing an artist who while musically coherent and imminently appealing is truly experimental a figure distinct from scenes and trends if you happen to hear something familiar in jamess music its like hearing it for the first time s return bears a release date and it might end up as the years best album but that feels entirely incidental it sounds like nothing else this year or the year before or the year before that one nor does it fit into any recent musical development beyond an incidental affinity with the resurgence of analog hardware amongst electronic producers quite a lot has happened in dance music since drukqs and this album is wholly ignorant of it all in its quirky globe-spanning promotional rollout comeback-ish aura and heightened disregard for the music around it im tempted to draw a parallel with daft punks random access memories but where that blockbuster looked backward looks in no obvious direction and it could only be jamess work even if it doesnt quite feel like he just whipped together another afx record either thats probably because its not how or likely why this album came together how is relatively easy to sort out james has said in interviews that was recorded over a number of years in an assortment of studios (this is how hes been describing his various production setups which from the looks of it are probably extensive enough to warrant the plural) this is less evidenced by wild stylistic diversity than the out-in-the-woodshed quality of the productions is freewheeling and playful but its every warbled note and compositional hard-left betray consideration and technical expertise that didnt come overnight in terms of impressive twists and turns theyre myriad tracks morph pressurize and reorganize but never break down exactly following a completely unpredictable if utterly natural logic is one of the most striking instances of this it begins with the instrument lineup of a brittle acid track save live-sounding drums which vamp like theyve been plucked from a sold-out wembley stadium gig as quickly as it builds it stumbles the squelching bass folds in on itself and the drums trade the gallup for an awkward but perfectly timed skip james strips back the arrangement to a thin pad playing a nervous cluster of notes then blasts it off with a synthy squeal despite the rising lead the tracks melodic undercurrent mournfully moves down the scale as the two lines merge the machines playing them detune and the progression falls apart in a series of tumbles that impart exhilaration and twinges of sadness in equal measure ive listened to the cut dozens of times and there are still sections that surprise me that i cant believe ive heard before though im positive i have james sells these diversions with the sort of charm live performers might deploy which is no small feat when working with an army of machines sequenced and slaved to one another and what strange bands he assembles: employs at various junctures an out-of-tune piano wind chimes tablas harpsichord a tangle of simultaneous basslines and a small chorus of computer-garbled backup singers every sound is at least a little synthetic but none factory-fresh has moments where it sounds stuffed but more often than not james is working with small ensembles the lounge-y hip-hop shuffle of isnt carried by much more than a reverb-drenched drum kit fluid bassline and heavy synths tweaked into string ensembles; the records end point the sighing features just closely micd piano tape hiss and birds chirping arrangements have long let elements trade off the lead as they might in a jazz ensemble and that happens to especially devastating effect on this record jamess instruments have never been so impeccably tweaked on the lead gets passed between a typically wiggly bassline and juicy synths all while rhythms built from an endless arsenal of drums form perfect fleeting accompaniments around them i have no doubt that james has given us an outstanding work of electronic music a standout record in an already peerless discography (even a relatively minor richard d james offering like the caustic window album unearthed earlier this year warrants all the time you can devote to it ) a record so immune to contemporary styles and aesthetics is almost by definition timeless and its tempting to call that but can music be transcendent by default i take james for his word when he said in recent interviews that new music is coming out now simply because it finally felt ready for the world not the world feeling ready for the material and i take a certain kind of comfort in that the deeper i sink into this record the less im concerned about its place and the more i want to turn off and be at one with the weird sounds combining around me
at the heart of any record whether working solo or collaborating with f x as black sites are the machines used to make it maybe that seems obvious but theres something distinctive about the way hauff surrenders her music to each devices faculties r claustrophobic drum-focused techno sounds as if it couldnt exist without the exact machines powering it ts an aesthetic anchored to its own limitations on which hauff has pushed since her first record in 2013 so if the hamburg artists second ep with werkdiscs feels a little stunted at times its likely because theres only so much ground it can or perhaps wants to cover and both riff on the same noisy jam session with a blown-out cowbell at its centre each rebalancing the same drums and synths to highlight various grooves working underneath also cut from a shared cloth of 808 and 303 arrangements and are brooding stompers issued in order of ascending anxiety and discordance only appears to be without a counterpart and this helps it stand out hauff allows herself room in the chilly electro groove for a few subdued melodic components almost like shes writing a song instead of jamming off the cuff everything leading up to the closer sounds like business as usual for hauff but is proof that she can expand her purview
if you slept on last years bells from the deep end and do not go gentle into that good night eps by glasgow six-piece then you need to catch up on two of 2013s essential releases the inspired fruit of improvised sessions at glasgows increasingly legendary green door studio these records were a yelping impossibly funky whirlwind of house frobeat punk-funk electro and several-dozen other styles given the bewlidered-but-delighted buzz those records and the bands extraordinary live shows have created its no surprise that this third ep is cut from the same cloth like many tracks is based on elastic thwacking percussion and a flurry of sighs grunts and yelps suicide-style vocals headrushing synth digressions cowbells and a relentless bass groove complete an unhinged eight-minutes of music thats destined to join dante pilgrim and rashomon among fans favourites throws together untie flo-style bongos gigantic slabs of bass and more street-lunatic vocals meanwhile achieves a spectral quality while still being mercilessly propelled by irresistible percussion it closes another spectacular offering from a band whore yet to put a foot wrong
owner of the newly opened outer time ner space records shop in sydney australia as well as a locally renowned dj producer and record collector hubert clarke jr knows his way around classic house his debut 12-inch for 100 silk proves as much with its attention to loose rhythms funky basslines and light soulful energy whats more offers a solid range within that style from the hard-jacking to s deeper shades to the broken grooves of clarke jr combines vintage ideals with a freeform modernist approach tossing in a psychedelic undercurrent to make it all his own is at its best when its just clarke jr hes joined by on a-side cut and their collaboration while groovy and invigorating at first grows stale as the singer coos and mutters to no end over an otherwise bubbly production australian duo mbm (aka babicka and mic mills) scale back the vocals in their dreamy dubby remix which better suits both and the ep as a whole has a nuanced way with house and loads of dance floor charisma cramming in vocals and collaborators is maybe too many cooks in the kitchen
theres a part in blade runner i particularly like though its only a passing moment harrison fords character is in a flying police car eating ramen as he drifts through a rainy futuristic vision of los angeles all around are blinking lights skyscrapers and enormous video advertisements like shibuya or times square on a staggering scale the view is bleak but also stunning and our protagonist takes it in from the warmth of the flying car slurping his noodles as the rain lashes the windshield i find the feeling of that scene in a lot of my favorite techno records cold and futuristic but also pretty and even soothing the latest ep from is one such record all four tracks on are beautifully drab a quality that defined s past releases as well but that really hits a high note here this is thanks in part to their inspired sound design which takes priority over club utility take the opener : the sauntering groove is nice but its the sounds overhead that really hold your attention a combination of (what sound like) morse code beeps and drips of water deceived and wheeze like steam valves the effect is at once warm and dreary the former limps along at 96 bpm; the latter is the records only bona fide club tune with a deep house rhythm and chords glowing in the mist its tempting to call that one the records best track but steals the show this is s boldest production yet seven minutes of a broken soporific groove with amber keys echoing over dusty scuttling drums
this third album from berlin based audio/video performers is an engaging and intricate pandora s box of pleasure pain and mystery coming four years after their previous album director s cut falls sonically somewhere between avant garde composition particularly the works of iannis xenakis or the darker tones of estonian composer arvo p rt and the group s past releases which have made patchwork out of ambient glitch jazz and dub the change in emphasis comes from marc wieser s increased involvement with the zeitkratzer contemporary music project though interestingly long term collaborator christian conrad does not seem to be involved with the group this time the music is not so much sonically sculptured but plucked lured and unfurled from a melange of electronic sounds and a vast accompaniment of well placed cello trumpet grand piano and vocal instruments and for an all feature vocals from the group themselves another departure for the result is more mature and captivating music especially when left in conjunction with the visual elements as intended video artist lillevan has taken his major point of reference as th century russian icon painter drei rublev and perhaps more importantly russian film maker drei tarkovsky whose 1966 film fictionalised the former s largely unknown life in black and white not only does rublev s work christ the redeemer adorn the cover but his name inspires one of the tracks whereas other titles leave cryptic religious references such as latin for fire or burning and greek for all-mighty also strongly references place the title of the opening track suggests the visual side of the package should be considered unexplored territory which it largely is while and help infuse an exotic pleasure and forbiddenness to proceedings the colourless footage of forests the gliding passes over wood grains the smoky trails and thunderous skies fuse with the music to present a comforting pastoral lull which then becomes unsettling once it is clear that the rich forms are devoid of comprehensible purpose stead each track is revealed to be full of controlled chaos and hypnotic anguish there is a lot of detail on which will reward careful attention and repeated listening/viewing but perhaps its strongest asset is an intelligence and confidence that is neither alienating nor sterile the end will have you hearing in black and white not to mention keep you thinking
has been building a reputation as a dj in paris for years but her recent productions have brought her wider attention her style of techno is deranged and hypnotic reminiscent of jeff mills at his most psychedelic take the astronomical hallucinations for the french collective why are we here or the industrial sharpened which was released on decoy but best of all are s self-released tracks where she roams freely through dance musics vaults gabber-esque you wont understand is a highlight along with the spangled drunk violins and the rave-ready to all loved ones is shrouded in dark techno magic sends you to the edge of oblivion with the title track which features furious synth notes that rain down in chilly torrents sounds harmless tranquil even but its just as frantic as the title track albeit in a silky gossamer-like way it evokes an image of an insect caught in a trap quivering with panic fluttering beats and erratic bloops continue on s icy sound design across the ep might leave you with a tingling sensation

the cologne grandpappy of minimal house labels turns seven (of sorts) with its seventh total compilation collating their best singles from the past year along with a number of new tracks these annual autumnal collections inspire the kind of anticipation usually afforded the return of prodigal pop recluses the collections themselves have grown in size in direct relation to the growth of both the scene and the label: this time spans across 24 tracks on two cds making it the perfect way for non-vinyl listeners to keep up my first record was sascha funkes campus their thirteenth release which lured me in both by wolfgang voigts involvement and its eye-catching graphics the dancing polka-dots seemed the perfect visual representation of the music - sparse bright buoyant - and unlike much of what i was used to fun this was sophisticated techno self-conscious but unashamedly funky dance music for wallpaper readers while have always kept up with current trends often inventing them they have retained an unmistakable sound - punchy brash confident - present on everything from the minimal fizz of dj koze to the syrupy neo-disco of justus kohncke or the limping dub of mikkel metal comparing 7 to past volumes seems the easiest way to judge things and if there arent quite as many moments of jaw-dropping delight as on 6 its nonetheless a bumper collection justus kohncke and dirk leyers as kontrast open disc 1 with grey skies disco-ish but clipped and restrained like dj kozes total 6 opener hiccup this time on getreidephunk koze scatters crackle and static while lazy cocktail-shakers keep time before like condensed villalobos it all winds into new formations justus kohnckes own love and dancing with its chunky descending bassline maracas cowbell and chimes is predictably the most disco of the bunch and tobias thomas michael mayers sweet harmony explores similar terrain only more macho and repetitive mayer and superpitcher as supermayer remix gui borattos pop release like you into an immediately jacking piece centred on throbbing synth swells and disarming vocals reinhard voigts tranceformation is less trance than its title suggests but it s still a shuddering synth-heavy example of textbook reinhard repetition these phosphorescent hues are taken to greater extremes in the rice twins for penny and alexander a speicher release where all is bleached blank but for dazzling foregrounded arpeggios like kaito doing happy hardcore equally drained is thomas fehlmanns saft in which brief fragments of wah-wahed guitar are moulded into muddy aqueous blobs rhythmically it rocks but physically it s vacant past releases offer further highlights: the wighnomy brothers wombat a staple of superpitchers recent sets pleases with sparse low-end bleeps and clipped percussion new blood hugs the happy monster on the k2 offshoot is both reduced and delirious as is axel bartschs redlight both examples of peak-time ketamine disorientation the fields over the ice offers marvellously sustained samples of female moans and gasps twisting on a dime into new incarnations the real surprises however come from s elder statesmen: jurgen paape turns out an aggressive sawtooth shuffle from yesteryear only its in 4/4 and a whole new phenomenon superpitcher meanwhile has the drums and bass surge while all else lopes forlornly like dancing on valium wasserman pairs woodcutter blows and rusty gates with a mismatched voiceover which fits like the best of profan while the modernists pearly spencer my pick here sees giddy arpeggios spiral before staggered chord blocks set in a key both heartbreaking and euphoric there are quibbles but these are few and minor mikkel metals ulyt the only shuffle track here is far from his strongest work both scsi 9 and jonas bering fill up tech-house numbers until they overflow without offering much that engages robert babicz debut sonntag starts on irritating out-of-synch blips but builds into something more welcoming oxias is a strong track certainly but considering the bad press it has garnered by being a facsimile of patrick chadronnets eve by day its inclusion here and therefore its continued promotion by is questionable that said is an indispensable compendium of s fine past year

chicago native jana rush a dj since the age of ten and producer since 13 has been friends with dj rashad gant-man and nehpets since the early 90s and released with dj deeon on dance mania as far back as 96 these days she finds time for music when shes not working as a chemical engineer by day or a cat scan technologist by night if that wasnt interesting enough her new ep comes courtesy of a new label run by heterotics lara rix-martin that focuses on female-identified or non-binary artists thats a lot of backstory to live up to but these six tracks of blazing footwork do that and more solidly constructed heavy low-end frenetic hats spare snares ear-catching synths and with plenty of funk its the kind of work that would make producers like rp boo and dj spinn (and the dancers that they do it for) proud the instrumentals hit hardest warpd s synth delirium is particularly strong but rmx brings a strong kaleidoscopic vocal cut-up (probable source: dej loafs k ) marries rushs two modes effectively
somnambulant laptop jockey sebastian meissner returns with yet another disc of exquisitely textured ambience the prolific multimedia artist has been a presence in the electronic music community for years releasing albums on such highly regarded labels as mille plateaux (r i p ) sub rosa and of course kompakt whose own pop ambient brand of furniture music he has practically become synonymous with via his work under the moniker this time around however he is striking out from cologne and taking it to new york - arrives on likeminded producer s fledgling anticipate imprint a collection of perfectly realized slabs of drifting tones humming drones and rustling static is primarily sourced from acoustic sound sources the record falls in line with the first two lps which were admittedly a bit too similar sounding for comfort but meissner now presents the listener with a more refined tweaked and polished revision of the aesthetic the heavily processed samples recall the withered majesty of william basinskis disintegration loops but the tracks - arranged with a painters touch and awash in milky reverb - are not just about ambience: theyre just as indebted to ennio morricones spaghetti western guitar as brian eno like so much of meissners work this record comes complete with an overarching concept in the past meissner has tackled topics as stiflingly heavy as the israeli-palestinian conflict and urbanization but thankfully is less serious: its a tribute album with each track dedicated to a pair of people that have influenced meissner in some way some dedications are clearly musical reference points ( ) while others hark back to meissners multimedia background ( azz ) and still others touch upon his own family history ( ) regardless when you strip away the conceptual framework you re left with a collection of tracks that stand out as some of the finest in a discography overwhelmed by excellent releases in the end with ambient music it s the listening experience that really counts and is as lush engrossing and ultimately rewarding a record as you re likely to come across with this album meissner has broken the project out of its stylistic rut and pushed it to the next level crafting an album that reveals its beauty gradually layer by layer with each spin of the disc
is one of the growing (small) number of producers involved in their own reproduction of italo/disco/electro/house in a typically move it s all about the high-tech renovation of an old style with the formulas left intact and only the methods of enacting them changed perhaps giordani s last ep for mule i m not lade runner saw the producer in a more creative mode (in the modernist sense of making something new ) especially on shrimp of portofino (the 2) which introduced a whole ceiling filled with congas to a floor full of polished drums to generate something well novel ut is a totally naked expression of all the typical italo signifiers hater might say it s just a matter of copycatting the clich s either way it s all here: the moroder melodies (which part like a hand through strings of sequins) and stiff electroid drum patterns i don t have to describe it for you you ve heard it before or even if you havent (as with the best italo) you ll swear you have it s super-reminiscent 80s movie disco of the highest order and giordani s success here is producing an arrangement in search of some film credits to roll with (and maybe natasha kinski) s mix does very little with the original arrangement it s a stretch and a tweak which is either a savvy compliment to the creator (as with tiger stripes remix of lee jones us ) or a sign of laziness personally i would have preferred the remix to teach the original some strange new habits (or just wake up with sore nostrils and a new tattoo) so depending on the complex admixture of giordani s intentions and your expectations as a listener this either means that the kid s nailed it or he should stop with trying the out-moroder manoeuvres and get some moves of his own i m not sure i think giordani is a producer with a future and that s remixes are sometimes second-to-none but an ep that contains two over-exact facsimiles of a twenty-five year old style will only be compared with that genre s classics and by those high standards (and my subjective estimation) this is second rate
is the last sound and magnetize who make monstrous tempests of distortion where you cant tell what might have come from a computer and what could be droning of out an abused guitar amp with the duo find themselves on the irish techno label but they dont alter their sound so much as (loosely) put a grid on it the title track is growling ebm spewing out melodies in long thick lines with harsh guitar lines buzzing away underneath the drums try their best to wade through all that sonic muck and being the dense thing that it is the track wouldnt sound out of place on perc trax ancient steps up with a remix its a pairing that seems droolworthy on paper though the result is a departure from the german producers usual techno onslaught the beats lash out in arcs of bent noise with a stagger similar to the original bathed in distortion its other elements hiss and crackle kicking up hellish chaos thats held together by a rhythm so slow its hard to trace where one bar ends and another begins takes a step back (though anything would feel restrained after that) and this time the torrent of noise concentrates into one thick wall of sound as a broken beat is sloppily coughed out the most abrasive turn comes with which sees the duo indulging in their noise influences as the piercing high frequencies cut above the snarling wreckage below the thrumming becomes overwhelming and claustrophobic finishing off s most distinctive release yet
if youre familiar with brooklyns at all its most likely through her work as a drummer for hazy pop bands vivian girls crystal stilts and dum dum girls where she most often kept a workmanlike metronomic rhythm she stepped out front-and-centre with 2010s outs where she unveiled a soft and melodious voice buried in the same clouds of reverb as the vocalists of her other projects moving from mphis dustries to indie-pop institution slumberland sees rose drop the band credit from her name and release a second album of surprise tasteful dream pop dominant texture on is silk whether its in washing synths or heavily manipulated caresses of guitar take where layers upon layers of roses sing on top of guitars and a wheezing synth that sounds lifted right out of bloody valentines touched sounds organic but feels otherworldly and ethereal a crucial balance on that keeps the music grounded in relatable reality even at its floatiest as modern and hi-fidelity (compared to previous outings) as it sounds admittedly carries the weight of decades of precedent: its on slumberland for a reason owes as much to the labels classic roster as it does more recent members like pains being pure at heart but the sinewy rhythmic foundations are the furthest thing from twee: starts with a primitive pounding and a riff stolen right out of unknown pleasures and the byrds jangle of gospel / grace is blown up to appropriately basilical proportions you can tell this is a drummers album: the skins hold down the songs even more overtly then they did in the morbid motorik of crystal stilts s the beating heart of moody stunners like in as much as the rhythms might hold the songs together s most promising moment is actually the one with almost no percussion: of features roses most affecting vocal positively slathered with honey and sugar and all those other nice things repeating a mantra over a slowly blooming backdrop of into brass a choir and a thumping timpani res nothing subtle or precocious about it the sound of rose replacing her hazy tunnel-pop with disney-level bombast thats not a bad metaphor for what she does with itself s not about to break any new ground but her attractively elegant mixture of dream pop post-punk and luxurious atmospherics are a hard combination to resist
a fledgling sound is developing out of manchester with artists like and tom diccio and helping fuel the norths already proud and diverse music culture where many northerners migrate south kumo has done the opposite and his music has been all the better for it with a slew of releases on delsin sub label ann aimee ghents curle recordings and dan curtins metamorphic imprint kumo has decided to launch his own net label [k:music] with this three track ep is one of kumos most accessible productions to date as a regimented dj- friendly structure allows for heavily processed and highly modulating synths to freely warble around its skeletal arrangement oliver does well in bringing a lighter yet jacking approach to kumos original by replacing s foreground lows with progressive detroit-tinged pads and rim shot percussion for an extra deep touch the vidab boss injects some muffled and sub audible dialogue preaching all things house music kumos is carved from the same stone as with a simplistic dj tool drum loop dominating the track while synths and white noise gradually appear and keep things interesting
sometimes all you need is the right bassline thats certainly the case on the first of a new pair of singles on golf channel from dean meredith (in his rhythm odyssey guise) and dr dunks aka rub n tugs eric duncan its not a terribly showy thing just a ragged sawtooth with the resonance set just so tripping up and down the scale like a groggy bumblebee but like the dudes famous rug it really ties the room together a wriggly centerpiece ringed by drum machines congas pulsing white noise and an ever-swelling array of chords and contrapuntal riffs balancing heady snare rushes and hard-edged flange with tin-inspired syncopation and bright blocky piano chords its rude and graceful all at once shrinks it all down to a tight four minutes and adds a dose of 303 resulting in a slightly more stripped-down cut thats still bursting with color for slower floors is a killer slice of dubbed-out industrial disco with a solemn voice intoning the title (italian for the key ) over gummy synths sax bleat whistles and all kinds of delay-chained shenanigans; the dub beats mix breaks it down to just under four minutes of thump and clang that bears out merediths alias with a keen (if cracked) sense of focus
in the last two years prolific san diego producer has rather credibly added techno to his resume with releases on perc trax and mote-evolver hes also started yet another imprint to help nurture his latest love the first release comprises three fluid dance floor tracks gently touched with the cinematic sense of melody thats grounded his recent work s techno is of a softer sensibility; the kick is more a pilot light than a foundation has the heaviest bass drum but its more about the whip-smart hi-hats than anything else it shines with all the futuristic glint of utonomic particularly halfway through when soft pads creep into the picture breaking up the rigidity with wells of signature emotion is tougher and its workmanlike stride and carefully gridded melodies keep it stiff like some perfect machine zooming in on percussive intricacies concerns itself with discrete rattling textures that percolate more like tech house than techno is a producer who seems to adapt uncannily well to everything he tries while he might not be reinventing the genre here its a promising taster for an intriguing new label
striking thing about is how much it achieves with so few sounds both and the are built on immense visceral foundations and shadowy mantras which saturate the brain as they go on in the former a weightless and heavily-filtered synth line darts across the tracks swampy surface undergoing a slow circuitous progression in the latter the loop is much shorter and sounds like a thousand monks chanting in gloomy unison doesnt do anything particularly clever with these structures but coupled with his detailed percussion theyre utterly hypnotic is fairly similar this time placing twisted electric piano stabs over the thumping beats only true deviation from the assault is from the it sounds like the type of thing ricardo villalobos might play or make: kind of world-music-sounding extremely tracky and hypnotic its little more than four-and-a-half minutes of booming brass horns over kicks and hats the lot begging to be looped and blended modularz tagline is in its purest form and really with the contents of in mind its pretty hard to argue

if s entry in the kicks series teaches us anything its that every is a cartographer and every mix the map of an unknown country eschewing genre boundaries cherry picks a number of cuts from leftfield noise techno and rock realms which he then spins into a unique and organic whole sleight of hand transitions abound making for a fluid suite that is as psychedelic as it is cinematic given his stylistically varied track record youd have every right to wonder which is behind the decks here hes made his way from prog and trance in his early days through to idm y excursions on 2006 lp idiots are winning dont be fooled by the sideways haircut here though: this mix is fully bearded entirely composed of contemporary tracks the vibe is so deeply kraut that i wouldnt be surprised to find out it was produced by conny plank check for example the clank and clatter of s dissolving into the fury of s own remix his version of is an easy standout and the first opportunity for the mix to stretch its legs after a bit of channel flipping offering a nine minutes of filtered synths and live drums tumbling across one another at a stallions pace all with the zen calm and ecstatic drive of early neu emphasis on rock tinged electronics (or is it electronic tinged rock ) gives the mix an open experimental air and its fluidity makes it feel as much like a live show as it does a mix feels at home in this vernacular and one hopes that the future will see more mixes incorporating this sort of material which more often than not operates on the periphery of the scene tracks 10 13 represent another deft stretch starting with a snatch of by black dices which slips without warning into a remix of by mit with forceful indecipherable singing and ecstatic chords neo kosmische acolyte arps shimmering fares just as well fading into the clockwork minimalism of front loaded with trippy headphone delights the mix only clicks into banger gear with s acid heavy of the as if had eaten a weed brownie thats only suddenly releasing its psychedelic payload into the bloodstream this followed by the throbs and surging melodies from and will likely be a rude awakening if you happened to nod off during the mixs more pleasantly downtempo moments its a nice final curveball in a mix thats full of them
the product of a rwandan refugee turned singer and a south african tv jingle composer coming together debut album for the ever-progressive was one of the unlikely hits of the year the albums reference points included afro pop south african deep house and shangaan electro and was its standout moment to a backdrop of staccato guitar a slo-mo electro thrash and mournful piano vocalist emmanuel nzaramba unleashes his traffic-stopping voice an elegant aaron neville-meets-antony hegarty falsetto which could all be very daunting for a remixer credit is due then to seiji and the for pulling off versions that are a fine supporting cast for the beguiling original broken beat pioneer seiji picks out the piano motif for extra treatment on his remix he slows the pace down a notch adding heavy bass pulses and fidgety cut-up synths that spit like mobile phone interference the mix finds messrs rundell and goddard turning in an enigmatic nine-minute house shuffle where this time the bassline a loping raw twang is the star its supported by an extended breakdown with 90s house stabs music box keys and liberal dollops of nzarambas wonderful vocals
you could call huerco s s second album a retreat but its far from a regression his follow-up to 2013s colonial patterns the kansas-born nyc-based producer (real name brian leeds) moves forward by pulling back his music has always been murky and mysterious burying beats under layers thick atmosphere but the atmosphere is noticeably thicker on to the point where some tracks have no discernible beat at all sharp sense rhythm and pace still courses through leeds arrangements keeping them in motion even when the sounds are simply floating along songs like (na ve and ghosts rhythm lurk in the distance controlling leeds sonic waves from afar like the moon affecting the tides in others a percussive pulse rides alongside rumbling bass and echoing synths steering the ship but never dominating the journey sounds like a rave at the bottom the sea youd think all this depth would darken leeds music but theres a lot brightness in those you making it sound hopeful even romantic album opens with a gentle mood piece called and concludes with a chiming nursery rhyme titled most tracks in between exude the calm comfort a pleasant dream res still tension in these songs as in any dream the unexpected happens but each tune unfurls with patient soothing confidence most impressive is the way leeds instills his calm tone into so many different sounds you can feel his steadying hand in every molecule the music and theres a wide range chemical reactions inside each track that was true colonial patterns too as well as the eps hes made since which hinted at the subtler direction hes taken here but those you stands apart as a significant step up in leeds journey to carve out and master his own musical form
theres a video floating around right now of abusing an kai mpc and it paints a pretty clear picture of exactly where the young producer is coming from obbing frenziedly over the unit while his osteopath looks on in terror hall pops to and from hip-hop tempo rhythms and turntable manipulation with the vigor and zest of a debut dmc entrant ts a striking display of dexterity ut its perhaps most telling when you clock his body language: has music inside of him it needs to get out nd on halls second appearance for kode9s imprint that compulsion manifests itself in 140 pm uk-drenched bass music -side takes off like the 21 45 from heathrow to detroit metro theres an interesting division of labour which sees the uk connection tend to matters of drums and bass and the us concern itself with everything in the golden mid-range roughly treated white-noise hats account for much of the rhythmic legwork and in addition to a giddy kick pattern are joined by a satisfyingly squared-off bass refrain meanwhile a blanket of melodic curios is thrown over this framework which includes all manner of sun-drenched pads and a gradually uncurling arpeggio y this point youre pretty much ensnared in halls honey trap of cross genre pollination but only serves to strengthen the sentiment slightly more wistful in its approach the track sports gentle tide-like chords and a muffled kick/tom interchange that sits about a quarter-inch from your face in terms of the mix nice addition in this case is an indistinguishable vocodered vocal and busy circuit-bent synth blasts slotting freely into s loose sonic aesthetic while imparting halls own take on the burgeoning uk scene e it house dubstep hip-hop or techno it feels as though any fruit is ripe for kmfhs picking in
res a little shaker on the thats really high in the mix at about five minutes into the track sits there holding firm as a mash of samples a guitar line a synth pattern handclaps get lowered in anticipation of the triumphant climax of the tune s a simple silly thing to get hung up on but every time i listen it reminds just how much of a jalopy this thing and the rest of s debut is: se are tracks held together by triangle parts the pop that occurs at the end of each guitar riff and malfunctioning sonar pings this isnt to say that s a sloppy producer far from it marco niemerski the man behind the moniker is instead a master craftsman taking in chunky beats and rubbing them up against wire strings until they work i imagine him in his studio listening to loops over and over until these dirty samples make sense to him playing alongside one another mirrors how its taken me a few run-throughs to really warm up to the four tracks on offer as well once they do hit though theyll likely be in your brain for a while: nunknown mines the calming sensations of kosmiche pioneers only rising to offer some hand drums in its latter half after twirling synths around its finger for much of its length while my love earns its keep by transforming yearning balearic into that aforementioned sonar ping fest only thing here that doesnt quite match up is which earns its digital status by reveling in its own bongo-laden trackiness res nothing wrong with bongos but its symptomatic of the cleanliness that abounds keep to the raw and vinyl here they wont steer you wrong

while writing this review i kept an eye on s twitter account to get a sense of the man i was surprised to see him tell a follower: lighten up fella ;) this exchange arose after had a russian club gig broken up by balaclava-clad gun-toting cops which prompted fellow producer violet poison to ask: what do you expect from an ex-kgb agent supported by neo-nazis around the world listening to youd guess far from being the type to encourage anyone to lighten up would have a similarly dystopian worldview for sure there are moments of sonic elation on s second album particularly in the playful percussion of or contact o nd of course even the bleakest techno has a built-in cathartic function an invitation to dance the pain away but the overriding tone here is one of visceral anger and fear the mood gradually lightens after the nuclear-winter opener but even the fizzing rhythms of cant offset the monolithic kick drum beating glumly at its heart dancing to that at 4 m there would be no escaping the sense of something terrible lurking beyond the clubs doors russian riot police or not in private perhaps is just a happy chap with an unusually keen interest in dark granular techno the anonymous producer certainly shows a masterful command of microscopic sonic details not least sandpaper textures and the foggy ominous bass tones that give techno depth and traction and the albums title track (during which a thor-like hammer threatens to fall but never does) both riff on fashionable post-punk / industrial sounds but in their sparse tribalistic way conjure a sense of urban alienation that is genuinely horrific was that s intent no matter its great art

andr lodemann continues his rather remarkable run with his debut 12-inch for the nascent room with a view label lodemanns trilogy 12-inches dedicated to various record shops showcased the variety sounds he has in his toolbox whether it be deep house techno or tech house here the producer continues this trend providing two tracks that have a throughline drama but are rather varied in their execution the title track is a slow burner that utilizes long drawn out bass notes hard claps on the 1 and 3 and a shivering bit percussion to add color to the whole thing its not a song so much as a mood piece but one that fulfills its mission with enough personality to stand out as much more than a dj tool meanwhile sees lodemann sampling string swells and mixing them expertly with a lightly acidic keyboard line over the course seven minutes its more straightforward and less a heartstring tugger but it serves as a perfect track to take the night from warm-up to something far more energetic the release comes with three extra versions the best which is motor s rework the stuttgart producer somehow employs just as much drama as lodemann but twists into his trademark pumping house sound (the bassline he drops here is particularly masterful ) while atjazz gives things a slightly more afro tinge and lodemann brings a more floor-friendly dub to the table
has always been a fascinating character for his outspokenness on social gender and sexual issues (check his website for a taste) and more obviously for his transexuality and his ability to change identities importantly this drive for individuality has also taken his music into widespread and often uncharted territories including electro-acoustic composition deep house jazz ambient and more under a battery of monikers this remix ep is no exception to this diversity oth sides are completely dissimilar yet both draw from the same source material the she s hard single released on thaemlitz s own comatonse label back in 1998 the -side is a blissed out ambient track perfect for coming down while the flip is a deep house killer for coming up made in japan thaemlitz s latest home of residence it arrives on tokyo label whose mule electronic imprint published his acclaimed triptych of you gain remixes last year the ambient rchive of mix seems to be another live rendition this time recorded at the cropolis the electric flute from the original hovers over floating organ drones and chimes that breathe in and out reassuringly but the drift of vocals towards the end is perhaps the cuts most signature moment: its an excerpt from the ultra red collection of samples and silences relating to ids activism an indication of thaemlitzs political commitment playhouse s remix immediately breaks with the tranquility however injecting a insistent bass riff into the same organ drone and then layering a matrix of new and familiar samples over the top including very beautiful flutes and chimes the ebb and flow of the track is as complex as the selfless bliss of the -side gaining and losing density and pressure to maintain a steady dancefloor momentum two beautiful works and plenty more to contemplate along with it
when the good ship dubtronica sank in the mid-00s left the spotlight with a genre-defining debut album satta under their belt peter heider and florian seyberth continued to release as on both k7 and stereo deluxe until 2010 when it appeared the project had folded apollo has largely turned towards retro-sounding electronica so this somewhat surprising release is in keeping with their recent output the nuremberg duo were always at their best on a downtempo cinematic tip which the title track and both reinforce through meticulously layered instrumentation is less engaging recalling the duos jaunty second album dust my broom but soon restores tranquility with heiders jazz roots arguably more prevalent than ever theres little to suggest these four tracks werent made 15 years ago but an old name doing what they do best is no bad thing
shake off context like water from a rain slicker their music has grown impenetrable and since 0 s over s it has arrived in increasingly large lumps of obtuse sound first came 0 double-album exai which messily referenced all eras of the uk duos career alternately brilliant and frustrating last year they dropped a collection of hour-long live recordings with all the ceremony of someone donating a bag full of secondhand clothes now theres - less than a week after unveiling the rancorous monster premiered another track on an alaskan student radio station before quietly ping out their new album if album is even the word for it - is a five-part four-hour-plus marathon that defies categorization as stubbornly as the music on it no matter its classified one thing is certain: its among the most uncompromising impressive and enjoyable collections released by rob brown and sean booth - begins with minutes of thunderous sound that evokes tectonic plates shifting its among the heaviest things in the discography and a warning shot of sorts much of the music that follows is unfriendly greyscale and usually without much in the way of structure its all long too with a good number of tracks hovering around ten minutes and three of them breaking 0 minutes those three are baffling but theyre also enticing onset is 7 minutes of elaborate fiddling loaded with sound that shudders and wobbles like organic matter its prickly cousin requires patience: it journeys through frazzled beats that eventually open into a bright over s -style melodic section before being blown apart by squalls of mechanic noise best of the trio is an unusually patient drone piece that recalls stars of the lid before booth and brown start poking holes in their beautiful tapestry there are some grappling points between s pery surfaces and shifting sands s into an electro pattern in its second half while the broken beats of hint at the duos love of hip-hop pleasant tones and poignant melodies pop up in and is distantly pretty calling back to early that track and the rest of s closing section might attract old fans disenchanted by s fascination with the algorithmic and inhuman theyre only a small part of a very large whole ever a whole that includes the staticky slog of and the hectic fluctuations of the elephant in the room is that - is four hours and eight minutes long even the staunchest fans are unlikely to listen in one sitting but the five-part sequencing (with each package available to purchase separately) perhaps s s that it wasnt intended to be listened to all at once its a collection that seems intent on moving beyond the need for conventional formats: you could jump in at any point or put it on shuffle and have as an enriching an experience as listening to it linearly warp announced that they dont plan on releasing - physically considering that is an iconic group whose fans snatch up everything with their name on it thats a big deal - exists only as a data dump its the kind of position that have been heading towards since they blended composition and randomization traded melody and meter for mathematics and started making bigger and bigger projects - moves without rhyme or reason and resists whatever narrative you might want to put on it four hours of dense bewildering and occasionally fun electronic music - is a logical next into the unknown for two pioneers
the masters of tribal breaks lee coombs and meat katie have joined forces for fingerlickin records to create a nice slice of tribal percussive house/breaks side a two men on a trip were they really tripping when they made this after listening to it id say they were lost in a flashback going back to their acid house days if that is the case then bring on more - this is dope starting things off with tribal percussion not dissimilar to lee coombs tribal tension track - that should easily confuse heads on the floor - damn trainspotters after a long intro of just beats the track builds up incorporating a few tech stabs and atmospheric swishes then all of a sudden the break down hits and it hits off with a nice piano line incorporating the beats after a few repetition adding to the chaos is an acid housey synth riff on the top and a squelchy 303 line for those that like cum shot tribal tension moist and all those dirty styled four to tha floor breaks tunes this is for you side aa the hum (meat katie remix) continuing on the tribal theme from the a side the hum offers a melodic bass line that listeners can literally hum to this is more of a summer tune with the funky synth stabs in the middle giving it that cocktail house feel yet its chunky enough to let people know that a breaks producer produced this tune personally being a big fan of tribal breaks this 12 is awesome - one side complimenting the other - and this should be enough to ensure fingerlickins heavy stance on the breaks genre whether it be funky big beat nu-skool hip hoppy and now tribal

with a title that translates to baptism you might expect s single to be more immersive instead bapt me feels especially dry its creeping strings look to create tension but sound too canned and brittle to be emotionally effective the downcast piano chords are played so softly they lack bite and carrying the whole thing is a limp house beat built around one spongy kick and one wooden tock which only gets moving when introduces some tinny hi-hats you could argue that the idea here is restraint after the breakdown bapt me does undergo a slight change but whats more obvious is a feeling of being stuck in high-definition limbo luke jenner formerly of the rapture lends a warbly vocal to the atmospheric dj tennis remix (billed as the lucky ) and its a welcome dose of humanity between its punchy drums swaggering bass hummable melodies and cohesive groove s own version of the dj tennis remix seems to make up for everything the original lacks not only does it fill the frequency spectrum and stereo field with vibrant animated sounds it also favors natural movement over a contrived dance floor narrative
theres a certain measure of patience audible in s first record for since 2010s survival the lead synth in for instance seems to take forever to lift out of the tracks oppressive bowels even once its finished inching into earshot its thick convulsing tone stays unchanged looping endlessly the other elements in the linear journey 4/4 white noise gritty stabs and rock-hard snares come slowly too each shining briefly before slinking away to let the tracks thrumming hypnosis take hold again and water are able to maintain this feeling of calm assuredness despite resting on beds of glitchy frenetic drums the former replaces the throb of with a wiry motif wresting it into asymmetrical shapes and flinging them at murky shards of melody the latter is much simpler revolving around just a single tone an abrasive digital foghorn is the best way it might be described but once again its delivered with extreme patience blaring for several charged minutes as drums and piercing chords flit alongside this type of robust simplicity is at the heart of a record thats both hypnotising and invigorating
when his father died a few years back made an album that sounded unlike anything he had done before leland was a catalyst rather than a fluke for the york artist pulling him away from the dance floor into more contemplative spaces shortly after its release in 2012 harriss mother also passed away was written in the aftermath which he admits was more turbulent and upsetting than his fathers death a stirring and complex record threaded with uncertainty shows that harris is not one to wear his heart on his sleeve taking in his varied set of influences its a record that brilliantly refigures house music as a deeply personal form of inward expression isnt the wrenching epitaph you might expect from its backstory its more of an attempt to keep calm in a fierce storm of emotions the record begins with a bluster of ambient noise and are both heady drone pieces touched by greg paulus trumpet and the mournful cello of emile abramyan from there things start to take shape with the more rhythmic harris channels his grief into something almost sublime where even the simplest sounds are layered beyond easy comprehension the albums few nods towards traditional house music are built like pillars of marble with kick drums that lumber listlessly ( ) or dance delicately in suspension ( ) is the crux of and one of harriss finest moments it breathes in and out with the organic quality that defines the new music on his label scissor thread slowly rising to a gentle climax with vocalist grys heartbreaking lyrics the words might seem like generic club fare we go dancing in electric lights and beats fantasies/ till the morning till the morning/ breaks the night but they take on enormous significance when you realize they were written about the night harriss mother died the song exemplifies the lps most striking quality with a pianist drummer and keyboardist on board feels more like an album from a band than a house record harris himself used live samples almost exclusively avoiding synthesizers or anything else that might sound artificial that warm and distinctly human sound palette matches the albums life-cycle sequencing drowsily brings itself to life in its opening run then peaks in the middle before settling back down to a jazzy murmur with crestfallen moments like and ruminative songs that feel dejected and hopeful at the same time s conclusion is appropriately enigmatic whichever way you let it close with the title track a downtempo number that sounds like harris pulling himself back up and walking on or with terre thaemlitz stunning 14-minute remix of which is tacked on at the end thaemlitz takes the same approach to composition and sound design as harris but pulls everything apart and lays it bare giving us a peek into the core components of his earthy approach to house its a bewildering end to a striking album a record that endows dance music with raw emotional weight without becoming maudlin or theatrical is every bit as intricate and tragic as the feelings it tries to translate
sometime last year started playing a track that got fans excited before it had a name or a release date the song was simply known as unreleased with numerous video snippets that had thousands of views it turned out to be the first single and closing track from the northern irish duos self-titled debut album even now sounds massive: theatrical bassline sweeping synth strings and an over-the-top melody designed for sunrise dj sets the whole thing verges on tackiness with an indulgent sound palette suited more to progressive house than contemporary uk dance music but it was precisely these qualities that made the track so good the rest of is loaded with gems that shine just as bright its a rich and varied lp that wrings the best out of 90s prog house trance and garage perfecting the effortless genre fusion that have been working at for years few producers have mined prog house and trance as unabashedly as do on the albums opening run s phased chord progression evokes a classic global underground mix cd the 90s breakbeat of is another highlight with killer slo-mo breaks a melancholy melody and distant wails sometimes resemble sing-songy early 00s prog producers like petter and the mfa as on the anxious downtempo of or the lilting brings to mind the world music tropes of acts like banco de gaia whose exotic anthem last train to lhasa seems like a direct inspiration for s lush landscape in other places take cues from contemporary artists they borrow burials deflated melodies on the chunky garage and ornate melodies of another lp standout recall the work of artists like four tet and daphni who work in a happy medium between home-listening electronica and the dance floor near the end of the lp is a welcome curveball with a wistful vocal and decadent synths kept in check behind a springy rhythm its another example of the duo using mixing and filtering to create tension s production values are impeccable the breaks are cut up with a precision touch while the ultra-glossy melodies even at their most melodramatic are affecting and hummable this is modern dance music that homes in on the melodic pleasures of progressive house and trance while avoiding the excess of those genres crucially one thing that dont copy over from their inspirations is lengthy runtimes most of the tunes on are between four and five minutes long all of these factors make the kind of robust well-rounded debut album youd expect from a duo who have always made rock solid tunes s tracks often rummage through dance musics collective memory they broke out with a classic house pastiche vision of love after all but they outdo themselves on taking unfashionable sounds and making them feel contemporary relevant and most of all exciting have never been afraid to go for broke and their debut album is all the better for it
early singles like the woozy electro of by the i get to venus and the long-night trance of you cant have it h ways established the juan maclean as perhaps df lineups most coldly libidinous act james murphy always wanted his fun fleshy; with juan sex dancing seemed like small engine noise machine people in heavy collision but in the intervening years perhaps even john macleans blood has gone a bit mercuric itself s debut full-length less than was a relatively sedate and introverted statement compared to juans first releases followed by almost three year of silence finally then last year brought two teaser singles for the long promised follow-up both of which bookend that album : 12 rompin minutes of retro piano-fueled disco house and the lead-footed futurism of recruiting lcd soundsystems nancy whang for some much-appreciated vocal aid and nick millhiser and lex frankel of df s holy ghost much of is a conscious turn away from juans jumped-up house and melancholic machine-funk toward the vocal-based synth pop of acts like league gone for the most part are the limber loose-limbed jams; in their stead we find a newly-focused insular take on early 80s new romantic revivalism for the concentration on shorter poppier songs on however theres little of the creative concision or melodic craftiness of bands like league or omd y made use of spacious and uncluttered sonic presentations and juans sophomore effort feels fussy by comparison often diversionary elements are compiled onto songs that could benefit from far cleaner tabling is especially messy with far too many instrumental detours buried in the mix and an irritating synth that sounds like a cereal-box kazoo spoils juan and nancys shrewd boy-girl exchange with the same overly complicated designs drawing you away from where your ear should really linger (its a fucking duet dudes ) where the juan macleans typically hooked you with atmosphere and long-form jailbreak grooves the juans failings to pen memorable choruses or tight confectionary melodies become a burden the bands never really shouldered before phrases like ill be here after midnight/ wearing my be-lea-guered frown choke s infectious string-laced strutting macleans voice long disguised behind vocoders and various mic-effects is central to the bands new designs and its milquetoast vibe creates an often unpleasant distraction with nowhere to hide comes down to juan himself and its like the awkward bizarro world version of pal james murphys sentimental york i love you though not all of the new material on is quite so frustrating locks into another of the bands open-collared stomps and dips into awesome acid-trail trance mid-track its hard to feel that juans second record is more than the listener given an ear to an awkward stage of growth one thatll hopefully pay off the next album out but at the very least weve now got on cd
it wasn t all that long ago when i was wondering who were soultan and tone depth only a month ago after their chilling rendition of portishead s classic roads that the twosome have continue that low-end deep pumping style of tribal house now getting a copy of the vinyl release of on i ve become a believer there style may not be new but the par stands right next to g-pal as gods creating ravishing late-nite tribal progressive affairs this canadian duo has emerged on of my current da shit list as the dj and production team has gone absolutely insane with this release now you know a bit about soultan and tone depth and their style of music you might be wondering a bit about well their another new label to enter the underground straight out of the maple leaf courtesy of main man himself martin villeneuve (mv) or to most tribal fans as the infamous producer envy not a newbie himself he s profile seen releases from deep dish s yoshitoshi and shinichi with releases from satoshi tomiie s saw this piece of dark black vinyl sees one progressive cut and on the flip mv feeds you a breaks mix back 2 back as when chable when released after the storm the original mix by soultan and tone depth looks to be the beginning of a big thing for both the production duo and the maple leaf province has done it again with importing more of their domestic talent across the globe canada has always been known throughout the world as a breeding ground for musical talent and soultan and tone depth continue that legacy the track is equipped with deep atmospheric sounds that combine with the bass-pulsation of heavy low-end snares and bass kicks throw in hypnotic heart pumping of heroic hymns and vocals that builds itself into a behemoth of a monster on the dancefloor it s moody and inspiring at the same time blissful and gorgeous mv s back 2 breakz mix is an infected water drain from your body as a thick ripple of rolling breaks fills the track for a room full of women nothing delicate here; the tide builds quickly as the breaks hit hard in conjunction with the originals vaporous layers that push the track forward a very rockin reinterpretation that s very effective and dynamic listening to both everyone will most likely go with the mv s breaks mix more than the original as most progressive heads are leaning towards the breaks and moving on from that four-to-the-floor beat nevertheless in the end the original is the heart and power that will continue to drive boys and girls on the dance floor to rip it out in the late nights of friday and saturday with their deep sultry late nite house sounds burning slowly into the dance floors across the world i think it should be time that everyone else gets to know soultan and tone depth i think it s a bit odd that so many new labels are popping up as of late boys like james holden (border community) james zabiela (hearing aid) and now martin villeneuve ( ) are risking a lot to further the progress in electronic music in a time where it does not seem as though there will be a light at the end of the tunnel this is frankly not a time to invest in a label as many have known of hooj s sad demise (rip good friend :( but i applaud their admiration and respect must be given when it s due
liebe*detail are touting their sixth spezial release as the heir to the popular fifth in the series the tobias and sebo k rejigs of efdemin s lohn brot luckily the producers they ve found to do the duty for s which shared an earlier liebe*detail 12-inch with matthias meyer have pulled off the feat of making remixes genuinely worthy of a sublime original ll of the tracks here retain the elegant and grown-up vibe of and none try to add much that wasn t already there lars s keeps the closest structurally unfurling at a leisurely pace and nearing the nine and a half minute mark ripperton s cut is the most reduced pushing things toward minimal new kid on the street boris puts in a slightly dubby effort there are no sleazy basslines or pumping rhythms gerrymandered out of the parts here and that s no small portion of the achievement instead everything good about is present in each mix brings out a luminescent intensity plays enjoyably with the melody and adds some perfect hand claps and ripperton leaves things stripped down in such a way that his mix glides right by you and as soon as you ve finished you want it to glide by you again perhaps that doesn t sound like a huge amount to go on about but it s the attention to detail in these manipulations that makes each of these tracks so beguiling
if you didnt know already dont use any machines no samples no loops nothing according to their biography it took the austrian trio several confirmations in mails and personal meetings and a rehearsal video to convince macro recordings of this truth can you blame macro for their scepticism i can digest the fact that the trios live music isnt actually machine-made or at least machine-backed sort of whats harder to come to terms with is that three such skillful musicians would have the inhuman level of patience or even the inclination to play such repetitious passages for up to ten minutes at a stretch here the why is obvious of course: to create interesting and unique music and like their past work fits that description entirely built around gruff ascending chords almost sounds like a robag wrhume creation; weird but entirely satisfying channels some serious krautrock vibes with incredibly tight arps ringed by miniature bells and haunting echoes its hard to believe most of it is done with drums and guitars in these components are slightly more apparent a heavy tribalistic beat cantering along and swathed with drawling licks of sleazy guitar last the rapid-whirling immediately calls to mind ricardo villalobos and his oddball ethnic creations no idea which tradition this one is drawn from but its wild cartwheeling plucks and insistent drums are utterly captivating who needs machines when you have humans like this
the studio wizard uberzone flew to london to hook up with rennie to follow up black widow with this storming release kicking off with nice crisp percussion polished strings and bouncy bass line not to let the crowd down then dropping in a whirlwind of sparkling synth filters giving it an unmistaken sound on the flip is the super style courgette mix slightly more punishing for the squelchy bass lines overall this release will cement further s dominance on the breaks scene
s third lp is a tremendous comedown record but not in the therapeutic sense because it sounds actually too much like a comedown to help you forget your own this fact alone is enough to assign this album breakthrough status but it also means it should be handled with care its brooding downtempo electronic pop so compellingly traces a particularly fragile set of emotional coordinates that you may find yourself more lost than found swept along by its shifting undercurrents somewhere on the wrong side of sunday morning wondering what all of last night was about tottering between utter exhaustion and wanting it all over again its no surprise that mastermind jeremy shaw is a recent berlin transplant: is the perfect soundtrack to eating doner kebab alone at sunrise after stumbling out of berghain key word in the albums title actually is about ; its all about the about consistently elegaic tone here is borne from the fact that theyre not songs for dancing and drugs but about them the dancing and drugs are gone having taken all the pleasures of the night with them whole record feels like you went out clubbing and partying and there was a big rush of sensations and you stayed out very very late and then all your friends went home and now youre back at your laptop with a midi board and maybe the sun is coming up and you should drink some water and all the loud pulsing sounds the firebomb bass and siren swirl are still echoing somewhere in the back of your skull openers chorus goes this is it this is us here we go which would be a rather punk rallying cry if the chords didnt suddenly strike a weird minor-key sucker punch at the end is full of morose twists like that (sample lyric: y took all the love out of the ecstasy ) if you read them only as deflated and downer-inducing youll miss the complexities of the albums emotional core contrast on for example between optimistic words and a pessimistic tune doesnt negate the former for the latter instead it offers up the stuff of life in all its messy occasionally vertiginous ambivalence isnt the first album to go the bedroom joy division route but its certainly one of the most musically refined and emotionally acute lyrically its full of evocative imagistic conceit as shaw tries to reach out and grasp a host of fleeting impressions from the night before like which summons a throng of moving bodies caught in the minds eye between shadows and strobe bursts sparse skittery production is the rule where skeletal percussion and pointillistic bass stabs run scattershot underneath layered vocals and controlled swells of guitar feedback on the beautifully mournful bare slivers of wobbling new orleans funeral horns and minor key blues guitar scrape against the silence each successive sound like footfalls trudging home in the dark its pop unfolding in technos shadow listen to the shuffling beats and you can almost literally hear the clubby 4/4 pound in their negative space as if the beats are carving technos image in its absence
larry heards best-known records are about the everyday ( washing machine can you feel it the sun cant compare ) but his fascination with outer space has inspired some equally exceptional music his 1996 full-length alien combined science fiction tropes with shimmery panoramas of pads and keys as loosefingers heard made the rhodes and hand drum of 2003s glancing at the moon seem like a longing gaze mr fingers 2016 had that same sense of wonder qwazars s soft acid lines and piano chords were eager yet leisurely a mood you might imagine of someone going to the seychelles not a black hole heard revisits the space theme alongside the vocalist chad white on whose four tracks are described as otherworldly future-house concepts theyre chillier than usual s rasping bass is etched on like a frown line on digital keys stab urgently against vapour-trail pads and celestial ambience this would be hair-raising stuff were it not for whites affected vocals hes both spurned lover and silver surfer on s main mix the cosmos is vacant / no worlds left to seek / more cryptic details i must release goes one line space and romance are an equally odd couple on where white after comparing a woman to a big bang sings stars need their space (some vocals remain on the dub versions where heard continues to show an easy command of his craft ) you rock me / the sun cant compare released 11 years ago captured a special chemistry between heard and white compared with the tracks on the sun cant compare with its down-to-earth lyrics and lullaby cadence felt like a naturally expressed love song on you rock me he sang with a similar ease over heards snappy piano house beat these timeless songs were enriched by whites heartfelt words only shows that some things are better left unsaid
emotional rollers have been there since the early days of house music straightforward and loopy they usually comprise snappy drums a pumping bassline pads a sprinkling of ethereal effects and not much else ochs last chance saloon released on trelik in 2011 was a rare recent example of this style they were more common during tech houses golden era in the late 90s and early 00s (soul capsule made a lot of them) b from e a new signing to the label also has a knack for stirring grooves dont be fooled by the goofy title of the newcomers first release -xxx because it doesnt match the music at around 130 bpm the eps four tracks are faster than most modern house with twinkling synths and the occasional pad adding a dream-like aura to otherwise tough beats and both on the a-side are the cheeriest tunes with plenty of melody loud hi-hats and rhythmic basslines they keep a constant energy level from start to finish so youll need to nail the transitions in and out to get their full potential the more atmospheric b-side leans towards classic house its two tracks could come in handy during a partys final hours but they lack the a-sides techy punch the flute-style lead of the kerri chandler-sounding might be too much for some dancers
following his debut ep for marcel dettmanns label joins s eponymous label for a record that defies expectations arranged differently the title track could make an industrial racket but its soft and floaty instead with snares that seem to evaporate into a lovely fog as clicks and clangs work quietly in the background hits harder but is no less beholden to melody and mood with a poignant midsection that tugs at the heart strings if that one steps on aphex twins toes stamps on them though fords bleary notes are evocative enough for him to get away with it both and shift gears the beats are tough and compelling even as ambiance and sound design remain fords primary concerns might be the most interesting its synths washing over a field recording of rowdy kids wants to be meditative but it cant quite reach zen with the din going on it forces you into a liminal zone somewhere between day-to-day distractions and the elusive other plane
the influence of the unremembered 80s in music is considerable and its a force that finally seems to be invading even the insular confines of dance music is one of ristols brightest new talents showing little regard for the goings-on around him and embellishing his productions to saturation point with vibrant colour his first release in several months comes on the new orca label only the imprints second but theyre tracks that would normally be reserved for the highest echelons of established labels i get the same feeling from these tracks that i did from jokers original run of singles the sound of pure personality and unfettered creativity finding its way into a brand new strain of dubstep s vision takes the sonic palette of chiptune and recent dubstep and sends it straight into tron ten minutes of stunning 80s nostalgia relishing in grandiosity rather than quaint reproduction is simply breathtaking as gated reverb-soaked drums pound at 140 pm a gorgeous thing in itself until it takes full flight the flight is majestic synths all varying shades of warm-blooded red as they multiply and harmonize; they shoot across the track refracting sunlight into anger lust and hope the high production value betrays an enthusiastic exuberance rare in dubstep but its not all about giddy 80s fetishism while the main riff is undeniably triumphant (think final countdown ) the nagging synths and percussion-led breaks carry an underlying note of melancholy is subdued and finds more detail in its slower amble than its predecessors driving headrush employing the same woozy synths the track centres around a downward-spiraling swell of glistening liquid metal that eventually shatters it throbs with an organic lifestream working in new elements on top of the skeletal framework that emerges out of that initial explosion the finale is stirring as piles on melody after melody until its a festering pile of screaming synths that sound like the thunder of conflicted and corrupted memories slowly falling away piece-by-piece music never mind bass music is rarely this universal this innately appealing and this anthemic all at once
if you like me love disco yet are slightly uncomfortable with revivalism then you may share my mixed feelings about nu-disco s good as some of the music is does it do anything more than look back if this is your worry then has produced an album that you can enjoy unreservedly is a collection of songs rooted in the disco classics of aly and merica yet pulled off with enough verve and imagination to bring them easily into a modern tradition key to the albums success is its sounds: reminiscent of but never quite wholly indebted to something long past theres a synthetic glow all around thats very modern spangled textures ricochet away from collisions with mutated percussion constantly res melody above the bass and behind the echo but its not the strident dramatic melody of lindstrom or moroder and neither is it the unabashed pop touch of mr flagio or blaze melodic passages are more reserved unfolding slowly in dub before being swept away by the next chord change s remarkable that an album so directly borne of the dancefloor conceals so many twists and turns dunnit heads off in one direction before being pulled back the bass dropping again and again until were rewarded with the final transcendent motif squeezed out on a guitar and sent dribbling on its way in drops of delay has all the musicality of old school disco yet its expressed in a very different way even when we hear the familiar burble of a 3 in its never for some nostalgic filter work-out s used as a funky back bone the bass machine carrying the tune rip up style vocals swim out of the mix for the first time on and tunes with singers pop up throughout gain theyre a nod back to the vocal-heavy days of disco but the vocals retain their own character many of these tunes would send the right dancefloor absolutely crazy yet the album never feels hamstrung by a need to make people go rave-mad perhaps this is because pulls all thats best from a wide range of genres from disco to dub modern house to latin percussion sounds like nothing and everything at the same time
its funny to think that a newer generation of fans might not have heard it but before untitled and special request there was released under his bobby peru alias the track propelled into the upper echelons of the dance music circuit doesnt sound like the woolford we know these days but it has a mix of roughed-up aesthetics and keen melody that survive in his work today with no anniversary or similar milestone to celebrate the timing of this remix package feels a little odd it seems like an excavation of past successes meant to capitalize on woolfords skyrocketing popularity both kowton and dense treat the original with deference maintaining its signature sparking filament and building new frameworks around it for dense that means loading it with a typically lumbering godzilla kick drum and then letting that riff go crazy over breakdowns where it crackles and pops like a short-circuiting wire kowton takes a less conventional route the kicks feel detached before falling away for skeletal grime passages that sprint by on a single low-end stab his remix is irreverent while dense s is traditional but both are off-kilter enough to be more than just updates of a classic
a label operated out of both montreal and mexico city since 2011 almost created a template for the current wave of global-minded club music from the beginning theyve supported producers from all over the world theyve encouraged the cross-breeding and hybridization of regional sounds and almost 50 releases in theyve been instrumental in establishing experimental club musics aggressive streak notable records from wwwings zi r and b yhzz in are among labels most punishing from bristols (head of new label nostro hood system) is something of a curveball in slow-motion the ep takes a deep breath and shows that inventiveness can also come at a leisurely pace s immediately feels svelte and spacious and its drums are extra slinky as a result dangling and spinning around the main flute riff like a loop from a psychedelic hessle audio track is a hybrid of uk funky and dembow complete with ultra-flat basslines that could have come from an early roska tune takes things down to a narcoleptic state staggering around like it can barely stand up it sounds like a trap banger with the joints unscrewed those three alone would make a fine ep but some of s power comes from the remixes it commissions a handy way for different crews and sounds to mingle tropical wastes iydes from london turns into a speedy dancehall workout while luke s rework of puts an irresistible tribal spin on things they round out a package that highlights an exciting new artist and underlines the savvy of the label hosting him
fabric had the unenviable task of following up both levon vincents deep house triumph with number 63 and guy gerbers melodramatic album length journey with 64 yve chosen to bring things back down to earth with something a lot safer in the form of leipzig tech house dj and producer whose effort feels like autopilot rather than the adventurous explorations of his predecessors runs a decent enough deep and tech house label in moon harbour and is a resident at circoloco one of dance musics most beloved parties circoloco made its name on a particular sound metallic drums overheated basslines pitched down vocal samples and theres a whole lot of that here on unfortunately what were presented with is among the more predictable and uninteresting of those tracks; 73 minutes of lazily grumbling low end and a percussive backbone that almost never changes touched with the occasional instrument or vocal sample its perhaps the most easily condensed snapshot of s style but doesnt make for a terribly attractive one each track plays out to lengths upwards of five minutes with few moments sticking out in the mixs ambling trudge more s proves a highlight mainly because it introduces a new hi hat into the mix but try and remember many other stretches and your mind will likely turn to the omnipresent perfunctory snare/kick pattern s mixing style means that transitions are seamless yet theyre almost imperceptible its difficult to tell where one track ends and the next begins effect is technically impressive in theory but in execution its a drain on the momentum with little in the way of progression or lateral movement of course that thrumming hypnosis is a trademark but over such a short timespan as a single cd it can easily turn into lifeless cycling is a more capable dj than makes apparent hell there are recorded mixes of his floating around that wipe the floor with this one its easy to imagine what he could have done with another hour to stretch out but as it is doesnt make for the most enthralling of home listening experiences its too brief to establish the languorous mood it needs and as a result the unwavering crawl ends up feeling like one of the series longest mixes
s never been one to linger demurely in the shadows has he on he joins forces with libidinous tech pop troubadour matthew dear whose mucky fingerprints are all over the track both and dear share vocal duties but its the latters whispering telephone sex line delivery that both parties settle on musically its a mid-paced tech/breaks stomp of choppy rotor blade drum patterns and rising acidic doodles which runs out to some kraftwerkian analogue synth phrases jacques may have spent much of his production career working with the great and not-so-great of the pop realm but stuart prices reworking suggests hes having more fun these days doing what the fuck he likes nudging the originals tempo to something more peak-time price throws in ravey keys hardcore breakbeats and pummelling handclaps dont let his commercial past put you off starting off nowhere near as strident as s but certainly more menacing mes remix finds the german duo leaving the acid elements intact adding frantic buzzsaw synths and stamping old-school hallmarks like rapid-fire snare attacks onto it
is the first high-profile release from part of the teklife crews younger generation he uses the platform to present a unified front: the ep features input from teklife affiliates new ( ) old ( ) also follows established footwork formulas but does so with vigour particularly in the first half where sumptuous soul jazz samples are stretched over a spindly chassis conjures plenty of ear-catching moments like the ecstatic string flutters on or the breakdown in in which its sample is shredded warped almost to the point of disintegration leaner battle tracks make up the eps second half delves into s chicago heritage with a sample of kym mazelles 1988 single useless over s convulsive rhythms mazelles lament ( theres a void where there should be ecstasy ) sounds doubly bleak on the title track a sampled shout chatters like machine gun fire over a tsunami of sub-bass before soul chords drift in to save the day

rotterdam is an industrious city whose people are renowned for their work ethic has a tough and rough veneer and its surroundings can be grey and eerily deserted s a world away from the charming bustle of msterdam but the locals are fiercely proud of where they come from richly creative multicultural and in a constant state of architectural renewal rotterdam has a unique appeal this is captured on the second archival compilation from and re:vive re:vive is dedicated to connecting musicians with free to use media from heritage institutions such as the netherlands stitute for sound vision (where they are based) y also run an artist residency program (where the recent lakker record struggle emerge came from) and other ventures ir collaboration with s is an ongoing project that allows producers to create new music using archival sound sources from different cities first damrak focused on msterdam and featured work from ten artists including swarm telligence rad (dara smith of lakker) and hotflush newcomer pyur sets its sights on rotterdam naturally (a reference to the citys area code) is a steely functional record res s grungy warehouse ode haven which is surprisingly restrained techno from the mord chief s is a decent head nodder with its swung groove ominous atmosphere and gritty textures might be the highlight of the dance floor stuff written by local veteran he invokes rotterdams gabber and rave history through his inventive sample work no hoovers here just a ships horn and a killer kick drum s does something similar chugging along like a steam engine church bells are another prominent sample s starts with them before sweeping into a somber aerial view of the city yre also the only sound in s floaty sounds of s are sharp and scathing a lot like s style of alien non music compositions new zealander appears with a street recording reimagined in his empyrean style s is similar a dense futuristic matrix of industrial noise for all the harshness has fragile moments as well such as s drifting much like rotterdam itself the record offers a rewarding wide ranging experience
joris voorn is the latest in the line of dj/producers to be invited to record a mix for belgian based club/label fuse previous artists have included dave clarke dj hell and technasia indicating that fuse are very particular about who they want to involve in this series probably best known to the masses for his track incident dutchman joris voorn has been djing and producing since 1997 with releases on keynote ( muted trax ) before dropping his debut artist long-player future history on technasias sino label voorns fuse mix opens up with the sparse rippled pads and his of reloads amenity with beautiful chords and synths giving us a light and uplifting beginning to set things in motion as this fizzles out things pick up with james holdens mix of safari followed by a funky tech house offering from alex under something you might expect from lee burridge or craig richards for its off-kilter nature the funky rhythms continue with business by mark houle its morphing basslines underneath and very minimal usage of drums guiding the tracks at times hawtins shufflephunk(beats) shuffles along with the basslines moving around and intensifying before jay haze robag wruhmes dont stop is fed into the mix instantly recognisable to anyone who is familiar with the latters work its mechanical twitchy jerky noises and snare rolls almost trip over each other in a comical fashion the basslines subside momentarily as the mix flattens out to reveal more minimal drum patterns in a sound that indeed draws comparisons to plastikmans work at times looped sections of tracks are used as the snare drums roll at times alongside tonal almost muted bleeps that become a part of the rhythm itself even at this early point it becomes clear that diversity is the order of the day as different elements are drawn on by the dutchman the building rhythms spiral higher in the mix but land with a gentle impact fizzling away and almost breaking into tiny fragments as the delicate warm synths of carl craigs sandstorms become apparent the bassline tends to throb up and down between low and mid range frequencies giving an intricate touch to things while an old-skool keyboard pops up creating a sound like a cross between a casio and something a rhodes would make taking the lead at this point the mix seems to give a bit of a throwback to the mid-eighties the layering of different sounds continues with daniel bells squirrel bait and visitors stop the music as we continue on our kaleidoscopic travels the reminiscing of past glories or history is quickly kicked to one side as voorn looks again to the future in a heads-down no-nonsense fashion an elasticated synth seems to contract and expand around the rhythm stretching and pulling us in an entirely new direction while the tempo is kept to a comfortable trot with voorn refusing to ham things up as in his previous productions he expertly crosses boundaries by showing he can point to the future while keeping one eye on the past giving the mix almost cinematic excitement guido schneiders mix of steve bugs loverboy uses a trembling piano-riff like something from an old hammer horror movie bringing this sequence of the mix to a close the electronic business continues after a tiny interval giving just enough time for the patrons to find their seats with voorn cut and pasting elements from tracks from hong kongs static drum label bpitch controls paul kalkbrenner and matthew dear the plot thickens as we proceed with no apparent indication as to what will happen next using the andreas kauffelt second sight minimal german electronica fuses with moody driving basslines while local area control by wake on lan with its robotic vocal and mr oizo sounding rhythm signature lifts the pace from a nonchalant stroll to a jog the clicky tribal-tapping of cevin fishers take on arthur bakers the break with its classic vocal instruction why dont you break leads into the edit of lil louis french kiss which sneaks into the mix in an almost under-the-door fashion before out-boxing the baker track for prime position the stereotype remix of megablasts jubita fattens up the mix with its ravey synths interspersed female vocal strains and a booming bass giving an eerie darkcore feel and apocalyptic warning to the listener before we are treated to some fine latinesque techno with jeff mills kat race is cut up with james bryants ha ha before dumped by g-flame and mr g helps to funk things up: that classic-house piano really putting a nice sheen on things - now were talking decadent synth lines wash over the listener and really elevate proceedings as voorn ever so gently applies more throttle and we leave the runway for a short glide into tech-heaven with fresh tracks like his own many reasons and dont believe the snake hips which prove beyond all doubt that electronic music can in fact have an abundance of soul finger-clicking funky movers from los hermanos tres ep and danilo vigorito kick booty as we are dragged off again at the whim of voorn who shows total disregard to anyone who expects an easy ride on his machine cc feedback from secret cinema gets us all gritty and mechanical with its burst of strings giving minor respite at times before kenny larkins ancient beats enters the fray structured not unlike daft punks indo silver club with its tendency to induce body popping joris again welds g-flame and henks stand-up onto it before firing in his own unreleased rework of pascal feos flashed back this chord and synth laden epic piece of music and electronic emotion is once again further evidence that joris is very good at what he does and comes at a significant point in the mix as the finishing line comes into view two razor-sharp robert hood tracks slash their way through our eardrums as bleep blobby almost sci-fi sounds commit aural g b h on our senses giving a nod of respect to another detroit innovator rino cerrone makes an appearance with his intense flood track using very funky jacking rhythms with more detroit-sounding synths with notes that scale up and down before aardvareke makes it minimal again and calms things down allowing us to slip into a brief lull voorn again gives props to two more legendary figures with claude youngs remix of retrovert and chez damiers rainfall ebbing in and out giving us that feeling of being lost in oceanic surroundings as we drift unsuspectingly away the journey through electronic soundscapes is brought to an end with tracks by convextion and ben sims leaving us a little disjointed slightly confused but definitely enlightened as the mix ends with utterances of fuse exactly the way it began this mix seems to hold on to elements utilizing them to their fullest extent before letting them fade away mysteriously at times subtle changes help manoeuvre the whole piece along because at times it does sound like one long track this has obviously been enabled through the use of the ableton live program but electronic music thrives on the use of new technology which is the reason why it evolved in the first place this cd will definitely not appeal to those who are expecting hi-energy hands-in-the-air floor-fillers but if you like quality diverse electronic music itll be worth every cent when its released joris voorn has created a real work of art here that takes many influences on board: both old and new and european and american the name fuse is apt as thats exactly what he has done by fusing elements of tracks with his own touches to give his own production feel to a mix of outstanding electronica forty tracks are amazingly utilised inside seventy four minutes of sonic wizardry showing that progressive house djs like sasha arent the only ones benefitting from the use of ableton although joris voorn may have only begun to spread his wings outside of holland appearance-wise his time dedicated to serious music production has been well spent and this well-crafted fuse mix should ensure he makes further impact take a bow mr voorn
has quite literally careened through the genre gamut over what has been a pretty prolific 15 years in the production seat though a predominantly noisy oeuvre and penchant for ridiculous titles may put off some those willing to forgive the occasional obnoxious moment will find plenty of witty intelligent and genuinely inventive ones too a point best kept in mind on first approaching his ep where s musical nomadism had previously occurred record to record over the last few years all manner of styles have wound up mashed into the same ep with varying degrees of success is no different s cocktail of influences dr dre daft punk and vangelis ( chariots of fire blade runner ) sound like a recipe for disaster but in this case have resulted in one of his more successful alchemic achievements both and are scopey works of 80 bpm synth-hop: one all bright and shimmery the other bloopy and bass-driven all three remixes are a delight too mochipet adds a little juice and canter to s original blissed out sway swapping the idm-style electronica interlude for an electro-choral clash that finds some unnatural equilibrium between beautiful and jarring but s own 160 bpm club mix is the one for me s juke but in an unusually lush subtle and feminine context adds skewered reflex tropes to the ep spoken with a typical tongue-in-cheek joe s virtually unrecognisable dub continues the theme sounding like something from the braindance coincidence compilation
back in the late nineties dub-infused electronica was the sound it was everywhere and then suddenly it disappeared at least off the hipster radar as electro swept in to replace grey smudges with neon bleeps and neo-trance s yusuke sakurai ignores these progressions: his 2005 lp debut echo euphoria invokes comparisons with prime force inc et al and his latest is equally nostalgic i always thought dub technos fall from prominence was premature that it had yet to run its course and while s arguments are welcome theyre not always convincing expands upon the clicks and crackle of his earlier efforts with louder drums and more intricate programming it s not a huge leap forward but in todays glutted market where everything is old hat it s kind of refreshing fortunately manages to carve a niche for himself while referencing earlier recordings inside the slack 4/4 pulse the glitches the hiss and delay - all of which could be sourced from any scape artist lie patches patterns and spacing that belong only to him most noticeable is his line in melody not something usually discussed in relation to dance music but it s relevant here: tilt offsets typically metallic percussion with glowing keyboard lines; route and cliff offer similar contrasts to jets of steam the former drenching them in reverb and tinny melodies the latter letting them loose in a pachinko parlour throughout its a meeting of monolake austerity and modernist bop where even the basslines have personality this all gets a bit samey but manages a few detours opener backyard lopes around at reggae tempo its offbeat pulse scrapes and echo the closest nod on the album to jamaica by way of berlin sweetbutters mix of touch adds jazz-house noodlings to the usual dour base while the misplaced meows of a robotic feline clutter the messy bounce but scar and a half decades (sic) both hit the mark: maurizio shudder and fehlmann squelch support harder-than-usual drums elsewhere fehlmanns own mix of cliff while not his best piece reminds us just how good music of this sort can be
a modular synth neednt imply a certain style or sound its just a tool after all but devotees of this particular piece of gear often seem to reach a similar endpoint: gloopy exploratory audibly improvised music the performance arm of the london modular shop shows some of these tendencies in its live sets but the trios debut ep is something quite different: a four-tracker of sharp concise electro that transcends the tools used to make it and establish the style which is dark and muscular with melody sparingly applied and counterbalanced by dive-bombing bass tones the ominous sci-fi mood isnt exactly unusual for an electro record but its rarely so well executed (the latter tracks meaty bass stabs are particularly pleasing ) the rest of deviates from the template s crunchy breakbeats supply a bit of ragged ardkore intensity though it never quite hits the crescendo you might have hoped for on the melodies take on a grander dimension evoking the cool majestic expanses of early autechre its the highlight of a slick and satisfying debut

is an uncompromising piece of business the detroitish-sounding moniker perhaps hinting where the head of its german owner jens shickedanz is really at forges some raw tech-tinged house that veers little along its path ut as much as its pummeling kick drums and thumping house alarm pulses have a ceaseless energy its that man le who hogs the frame again here ts not surprise that the parisian appears to be turning up on every other remix of late; the man is in his pomp at present s his recent ep for eklo hinted leonard perret looks at deep house in cinemascope here he uses classic alearic tropes on his rethinking of throwing in ghostly rhodes pianos rising analogue synth chords and subtle tippy-tappy percussion the big league is just around the corner you suspect for le
new yorkers and cory james launched their label last year with a solid split ep jettatura painted the former as a hardware whiz capable of finding beauty in the stormiest of synth workouts while james plied snarling atmospheric techno a year later returns for a solo turn that pulls her loose threads together just enough to make sense on the dance floor while keeping her taste for exploratory sound and composition only reflects the gurgling slosh that defined s previous effort its an ekoplekz-ish experiment in harnessing murky underwater electronics with darting buzzes that sound like electric eels jordan attempts to pull it together with a kick drum on his remix but instead of framing the track his rhythm pushes everything out so the atmospherics swirl around his foundation its a pleasing approach that offers more than your average dance floor makeover and are more controlled than former thunders by slowly dunked in what sounds like a bottomless pool of reverb softer brings in pearly textures borrowed from dub techno which soften the straightforward attack both tunes are the most club-ready weve heard from yet theyre defiantly non-functional with two releases on deck its clear that techno is meant to be generative and volatile its an approach that uses quantized grids not as a limitation but as a platform to do freaky things
because it features 24 snippets of tracks segued toge r into one hour long set re are two ways of looking at s new album one optimists is that nicolas chaix is attempting to capture energy of a live set in studio by honing his music down to its most effective components the o r view is that this is a bunch of tracks he couldnt be arsed to finish properly anyone au fait with frenchmans productions over years from tracks like disco cubizm he released on coattails of daft punk during 90s to recent warped disco of disco que will know that chaix has no trouble crafting a killer 12-inch but its also case that his albums (1999s adore and 2003s 3 ) ranged broadly across bumping house to deep techno and contained a fair few fillers as a result egamix is no different in that sense its just that here duller tracks are over be e youve had a chance to get bored and better moments dont quite last long enough all of this makes egamix a ra r bumpy ride the way chaix switches between styles after rarely more than three minutes can feel like youre being cibly frog-marched through a club of 24 different rooms just settling into galactic techno groove of welcome to clanging old-school rave stabs of but while it may never stop long in one place egamix has more moments thatll leave you wanting more ra r than opposite the balearic beats of are as good as dj harveys locussolus album could have been disco cut-ups of y o u r o c k shows he still has classic french touch sees sueno latino -style melodies fluttering over techy beats and when disco que rears its head towards finale it still sounds as epic as lindstrom egamix ends with sound of pouring rain while a piano breakdown fades away into distance as if doors to club have finally shut you cant help but think though that this is one venue that would open again just one more tune

a nick holder remix album might not be seen as an immediately logical release for nrk but when you get a feel for the quality of remixers involved everything falls into place holder is known as a deep house producer par excellence but the other mixes includes plenty of other styles and is a well-balanced album ian pooley s west coast sensibilities show in on my mind sweetly soulful and drenched in sunshine the smooth edges roughen for harmonic 33 s take on history in the making a brassy loop that sticks in the memory and provides the perfect foil for the rap then it s the big one no more dating djs as restyled in a hip hop guise by pete rock later john ciafone points this one of holder s best towards a pumping house dancefloor chicken lips contribute a sparse minimal version of player 1 while a man called adam throws several beat styles into the cinematic mix of back again solid house material ensues then from solid groove and freaks who take on bad girl and my friendly neighbour respectively even if you have holder s the other side album on which all these remixes are based you ll want to consider this rather than being a cash cow it s an intelligently prepared compilation looking at holder s music in a different light
s last release shaping way on enemy records was a strong often subtly melodic three-tracker in the wake of that one is the argentinian techno producers debut on and unfortunately it feels like a step backward raw jacking edge heard on shaping way is largely absent drums here though they boom are conspicuously simplistic and for the most part the four tracks sound slick but too safe even with some clever drops and transitions a-side relies too much on 16th-note percussion and neither the title tracks distorted swaths of sound nor s monotone blasts make much of an impression first on the flip is which is busier but only a little better as a tool with a few suspenseful drops leading back to more stomping big-room doldrums at least ends the record on a solid note its a lean cut led by a terse acid riff and suffused on occasion with low-whistling white noise but otherwise leaves much to be desired

most people probably know patrick radomski through his work as milton radley the alias under which hes dropped more than ten 12-inches since 2008 lot of the erliners best work however has been released as an acid techno project that debuted in 2012 s radomski releases streamlined and accessible dance floor cuts every instalment so far has been top-notch with enough variation throughout the series to keep things interesting the fifth and most recent effort is a detour into house like all but one of the series previous editions comprises two untitled cuts oth have just a few elements assorted mutations of acid squelch and snappy drums but create very different moods the -side is fun and jacking and feels like it would work well at any point of a peak-time set more serious techno cut sits on the flip here the acid line is restrained with the track probably best serving as a snaking tension-builder whats most remarkable about this release (and the rest of the catalogue) though is the range radomski gets from such a modest palette

we feel there is too much damn fragmentation out there in the field and at times it seems like its every man for themselves so its time to stick some of the true heads together and show them what were made of dj tlr label head at cr me organization and the man behind the collaborative valley of shadows 12 inch series has a point as the label market grows increasingly saturated joining forces with likeminded imprints is one way to double the impact reach and talent while halving the costs and permanent vacation are the latest tag team to try the approach together releasing the neatly titled four tracker for the ep the labels called upon a mix of contributors old and new first up is uk dance veteran with a propulsive cosmic electro track that flits and fizzes s live version of which first came out on in 2013 is camper and zestier than the original singing over baggy kicks and the tracks sugary 80s synths he flows with swagger it takes a few listens to warm to but once youre locked its catchy as hell by comparison s feels rudimentary a simple disco house groove plays on a drawn out loop adorned with smatterings of hi hats and vocals keeps to the same slow pace but this time turns out a heavy hearted slice of deep house that for all its melancholia sees us out in a light fog of optimism
some productions sound truly electronic smooth futuristic formed by electricity others feel like theyre made of something more tactile: wood concrete sandpaper and so on though hes made records of both types is a master of that second category (much like his friend levon vincent) the latest ep on his label is a trippy sinister techno 12-inch brought to life by coarse textures title track is as slamming as it is psychedelic thick slabs of synth wobble like a drunk trying to sit up straight dizzyingly out of time with the tracks bruising kick drums has the same gravelly production style but less of a clear hook a simple repeating acid lead rings out over its galloping drums creating a tense and atmospheric dj tool is a beatless sketch that pairs a somber piano loop with a mostly unintelligible vocal recording (one line stands out from the murk: youll be my guide and ill be yours ) last october i said is on a roll a few months later hes only picked up more momentum
tropical air animates the lead single from the finnish duo s imminent debut album but its a weird chilly tropicalismo and its far from the full-bodied eager-to-please mannerisms of their previous work for made to play with its bouncy carnival-at-panorama-bar vibes the loping rhythm is infectious and the steel-pan-inspired melody is a surefire crowd-pleaser but you can also hear an echo of dj mujavas township funk similarly dry and spooky; the titular refrain muttered and then chanted only thickens the slightly unsettling atmosphere like a conga line disappearing into a fog of dry ice there are plenty of remixes and on balance they work well taking elements of the original to places you wouldnt have expected dopting a more straightforward tech house stomp sei goes for bitcrushed corrosion subtle acid and a heads-down groove of hard toms and tinkling bells paul takes an old-school acid route with a guttural bassline and flashing searing cymbals and claps; the melancholic lead serves as the perfect segue to an inspired piano passage at the tracks climax t first matthew herbert doesnt seem to do much more than drape a layer of cheesecloth over the source material but as new chords and a new vocal take a hard left he manages to turn the song on its ear turbo artists gingy deliver the eps secret weapon its not rocket science: the rhythm chugs like superpitcher or chloe the vocals are looped just so and the details are gratifyingly dubbed pinwheeling synth lead is what sets it all off and beneath furrowed brows the eyes widen reflecting blacklight acid fireworks
s resident icelandic synth-poppers recently teased their upcoming new full-length with the single a characteristically jaunty amalgam of looping synths steady beats and flamboyant vocals this remix ep comprises four reworks with the opening three achieving roughly similar floor-ready results before a more abstract interpretation closes the package maceo s remix is an unsurprisingly sleek kick-off its closing section which blends ten walls-style horns vocals and thumping drums is the packages most euphoric moment and will doubtless do brisk business in ibiza and beyond this summer konstantin sibold ramps the vocal up to glam-rock flamboyance levels and pairs it with slowly rising bass and celestial pads in a familiar but effective way michael offers a contrasting take he ditches the vocal entirely save for the odd sighing fragment which disappears into a gently propulsive landscape of mid-paced percussion disco-tinted keys and chimes member gluteus meanwhile turns in a wonky collision of vocals and all manner of malfunctioning-machine noises thats a refreshingly different palate-cleanser after the club-geared indulgences preceding it
cross its first nine outings has established itself as a hotbed of eclecticism moving from danny rowns slack jawed hip hop to the jacked up electro of label co founder rodinski their tenth release turns to the north merican beat scene inviting young talents and onboard montreal born producer has racked up over 1 5 million youtube hits to date through a series of high profile remixes taking his low slung style to the likes of janet jackson teedra moses and erykah adu in sticks by his usual formula it deploys isolated chimes that drop into a stripped back bass assault with the collision between these elements making for a tuneful slice of glitchy hip hop s is similarly accessible laying pan pipe synths and grand pads over skittish beats it rounds off a short but sweet release that further cements as one of the more open minded outfits out there
operating from beijing the pleasingly consistent has thus far pursued only the most melodic of detroit-influenced techno its an approach that continues here with the appropriate choice of kriss kortz slotting in at number six on the catalogue feels very much like brian kages salmon fishing from earlier this year that can only be a good thing again crisp claps are the sharpest element on offer with the bulk of the track filled by masses of iridescent synth lines these soar majestically over quietly tinging cymbals to impart a gentle sense of calm carlos remix swaps what was a relatively plain beat for a stomping march and drags the most prominent chords back towards earth for a more heads-down result somewhat livelier features a strangely tuned kick which punches resolutely through all the other elements here kortz has fun playing with resonance building euphoric synths to restrained peaks before pulling them back down and filling the troughs with rounds of compact claps is the hookiest of the bunch leading with a dogged blooping its relentless in its own way despite the overt brightness of the whole thing lightweight metallic shunts and rolling hi-hats sustain this bustling structure above shuddering restlessly but never upsetting the cart returns to the sleek driving vibe of comparably its also brimming with swathes of gleaming synth most of its energy is generated by a deep massaging bass sequence that pauses meditatively at the end of each phrase this is paired with a quick double-hit from the kick drum at which point a new phrase begins and the intensity seems to jump up repeatedly its an old trick but one that works exceedingly well the same could be said of the positive changes ep in fact its not breaking any boundaries but its a lovely listen nonetheless
remember when wonky was almost a viable genre chances are do while the duos music doesnt fit in with everything under that wide-ranging and largely discredited umbrella term their deeply off-kilter music does fit somewhere on its fuzzy timeline s debut ep obviously owes something to the likes of girl unit and bok bok its rubbery percussion and sickeningly see-sawing melody lines leaping and tunneling like a possessed raver but arent quite as obsessed with clean lines and crystal-clear sonics as their uk house/bassline/whatever contemporaries what sets apart (aside from being based in poland as is fledgling home ) is their unremittingly frantic energy a freewheeling chaos that sounds dangerously unstable at points in you can almost hear the intense shaking loosening and rattling all the screws and joints; its a wonder the track doesnt simply fall apart and give way under its own quivering mass they strike a valuable balance of cartoonish exaggeration with menacing sonics the almost humourous moments of are offset by the thundering bass underneath the songs sly grin quickly turns masochistic as the relentless dips and surges wring the life out of tenacious dancers picks up right where left off this time armed with a more decisive thump but if the latter was an unrestrained mess the synth in sounds like its trying to destroy the entire track bouncing around violently and stripping itself raw as it bounds through unseen climes and locales when it returns its exposed nerves are covered in all sorts of thick goopy digital mess which it proceeds to spread all over its surroundings have tapped deep into a scene whose aesthetics are already growing predictable and engineered it into something wonderfully quirky unique and surprisingly accessible if these tracks dont leave you writhing on the floor theyll at least leave you with a smile on your face
comparing the levels of introspection in releases is always a matter of degrees but this jake fairleys first new material of the year is at heart a more mediative beast than last years automaton album is a sedate opener even by fairleys standards its beats and bassline providing a half-awake backdrop for woozy ribbons of synth its pleasant but has a background-music quality that makes it a surprising choice for an opener higher-tempo title track might have been a more obvious kick-off with an undulating synth line and acid bass squelches building neatly into a vocoder vocal sits somewhere between those two its combo of pulsing beats synths and a low-in-the-mix vocal making for a sleek and shiny whole is the most atmosphere-packed thing here all slow-motion beats and dreamlike pads while rumbles ominously along punctuated by flitting synths and a ritualistic vocal harmony my personal preference in material is the borderline poppy likes of automaton s alkaline and old ways but fans of his more comprehensively downbeat moments should find plenty to enjoy here
reakbeat techno or hip-house maybe not a usual dilemma but s latest single for london-based phonica record store and label toes the line between the two taking his recent somewhat slinky sound ( loodline ) and unscrewing it just a little bit more so everything sounds dangerously wonky cant with its slamming kick and shuddering static chords feigns erghain-associated toughness ut about a minute in a loud synth wail signals the rather abrupt entrance of audacious well-oiled breaks that loosely orbit around the central rhythm a disorienting effect that duels for attention with the songs less challenging thump the violent motion sickness is accentuated by a playful descending bassline and an oddly-timed vocal sample that stutters and echoes in swathes across the track areback isnt quite as light-hearted slithering through a bed of tape hiss before exploding into wandering percussive shards and ravey chord stabs that act as the ghost of the lumbering stomp from cant
a: kingdom a breath of fresh air for breakbeats as we know it simple are new boys on the block straight outta the uk focusing on the deep broken house styles of breaks their opening single sets a good precident for whats to come kingdom breaks out with tribal percussions and a tight filtered bass under tone building to a settled rhythm which introduces some fuzzy basslines perfect for the start of the night or 6am in the morning music lovers need only apply aa: karma much more mellower then the a side filtered bass again but this time its like swimming underwater jazzy saxaphones and synthns keep it all in check adding interest to the track mid-way though the breakbeat tightens to an almost 4/4 structure pace picks up as the tension builds a well programmed track that has the same influence as a 6am sunrise lush youll see what i mean when i say music lovers need only apply
simple ingredients expertly blended can produce devastating results s latest ep for soma is a case in point a jupiter 6 synthesiser a novation super bass station and a 909 were all it took to build a couple of dance floor bombs on henning unleashes the potent thump of the 909 early quickly wrapping it with a snaking bassline that massages its way along the spine of the track this is stripped-down bold techno with only a single swollen synth note offering relief from the mass of percussion if anything has an even clearer focus hitting harder and with even more intent the relentless thwack of the kick gets submerged in a flurry of abrasive synths eventually retreating into a cacophony of squealing oscillation this is minimal as in minimal fuss
couple of years ago i wrote about a gradual change id noticed in the music of joe cowton k techno has recently emerged as an equal partner in the synthesis of uk club styles that he and have helped establish in doing so tracks like glock roll and on repeat where melodies and vocals coiled like a tightening fist became increasingly insistent over the course of an album that approach may have seemed too forceful but on technos dn enhances the music the robert hood-style chords on are among cowtons strongest detroit references thanks to a skipping shaker pattern and discordant string plucks the music maintains the skittish energy of previous releases while the chords add more instability the eight-note loop keeps its shape across the track but the notes themselves wobble like glass bottles in a moving crate is a more typical jam the drums strike in odd patterns and the low-end is as thick as smog strange rhythmic accents circulate like the laugh that unfolds into a loop other features revving engines synth notes that curl up like question marks are more unfamiliar but theyre small surprises on a 12-inch that otherwise consolidates cowtons sound

boss matt tolfrey supposedly first heard s during one of the latters performances at his half aked residencies promptly signing the record on the spot its not hard to see why he got so excited for is nothing if not instantly arresting croaky spoken-word vocals is nothing new in electronic music of course but its been a while since one has punched its way through the mix quite in the same way for some this will be the tracks single greatest achievement; a tangible hook in the otherwise vocally-barren landscape of tech house i cant help but think though that the vocal somehow detracts from the rest of the piece a thunderously bouncing effort with a bassline easily as funk-filled as anything from crosstown rebels camp flip over the vinyl version and youll find a disappointing interpretation from filipe who seems to do a little more than thin out the bassline add a few hats and make the vocal even tinnier and all but indistinguishable adding to the irritation that its still there at all mix on the digital version is a lot more interesting taking the record on a dark proggy claustrophobic journey and creating something that is genuinely spooky
though william thomas burnett isnt exactly new on the scene the producer now known as seems prime for a breakout: with l i e s piquing worldwide interest in some of the stranger corners of the new york house scene it wouldnt be surprising to see one of its earliest signings getting a fair amount of buzz as if on cue his latest the ep arrives on will bankheads always attention-grabbing isnt flawless but burns seems to know his musics limitations and use them to his advantage sticking to just a handful of core sounds sandpapery strobing pads and reverb-y drums chief among them he burrows deep instead of spreading wide title track absolutely kills: with huge synths banging out confused chords over a sharp rhythmic stutter burns blasts us into glorious submission is more subtly catchy driven by ticklish bitcrushed guitars that seem to have wiggled into the mix from a youtube video on the flip completely makes over many of these same sounds with the addition of a few misty-eyed piano notes eps only unwise inclusion is a in a noodling slow jam that doesnt go much of anywhere
s is an assured if familiar-sounding record from a berlin-based irishman making his debut on its house and disco hybrids lean on popular dance music samples on for instance mike dunns bassy tone offsets a chopped synopsis of the mood ii swing classic move me it also introduces through choral synth tones a certain chilliness nother feature of s is its smart use of vocal samples deployed by ring as a rhythmic device on and on a daft punk-evoking track that for me just beats a revving bassline stamps itself on rings aqueous funk guitar for all rings emphasis on grainy organic textures this synthetic touch really caught my attention is s only misstep rings drums turn a pleasant ambient swampiness into a trudge through tar a trip that the vocal reverbed to oblivion seems ill-prepared for
according to the press release the two lengthy tracks that make up -1996 were assembled solely using sounds sourced from s collection of jungle cassette mixtapes gamble a jungle enthusiast in his teenage years here revisits a past love with the intention to extract expand upon and convey particular qualities emblematic of the original music gambles previous releases for the likes of london label entracte have tended to foreground their intensely synthetic qualities but diversions released on the imprint sees the producer take a less involved approach amplifying the hazy grain of his source materials but rarely obscuring their basic sonic properties at points something like a groove is hinted at and there is a brief period of breakbeat propulsion near the end of side b but for the most part this is static music: a succession of starkly beautiful moments each one suspended in space for a moment and then abruptly supplanted by the next diversions is perhaps best viewed as an impressionistic rendering of the experiences of jungle culture in its heyday: its bleak post-industrial landscapes the heady disorientation of its highs and the dead-eyed paranoia of its lows stitched together into a surreal dream-like narrative reformed junglists may register certain moments as clarion calls from a halcyon past: side a opens with a diva ooh stretched out into penumbral infinity and closes with a swatch of brooding sci-fi paranoia; elsewhere clouds of airy timorously beautiful pads float over brooding 808 thuds near the middle of side b a brief glimmer of euphoria is expelled by a succession of throbbing industrial pulses still gambles approach to his source material is satisfyingly oblique search for a narrative logic in diversions and you wont find it; but as an evocation of a time and place or rather one mans memories of it it is both sinister and poignant in equal measure
last year was big for modular synthesizers january moog announced that they would bring back three of their large-format machines experienced wire juggler blawan kickstarted his ternesc label with two modular-made eps and even artists from outside the dance music sphere namely llesandro cortini martin gore and sam prekop of sea cake released synth albums fter premiering in 2014 modular synth documentary i dream of wires reached new audiences with a wide release and solvents extended soundtrack manufacturers themselves cashed in on the revived interest in the music of their machines this makes venetian snares latest album feel oddly trendy for an artist who doesnt give a damn about trends its the first record to land on his planet mu sub-label since 2012s stinging fool detector ep could call that one quintessentially snares: full of jumbled opposites ludicrous wit and severe solemness digital and analogue hybridity orchestrated chaos it was as fun as it was disturbing but records like that obscure the sheer craft and studio obsessiveness of the artist and his creative process reveals the whiz operating the machines s the title points out these 12 songs were written with a modular synth built from scratch and broken down again after each recording whole thing took five months for aron funk to make at his home studio in winnipeg canada feels honest and straightforward operating like a window into funks world one that revolves around music machines and little else can imagine him holed up indoors shuffling from bed to synth rack and back again only pausing to roll another cigarette what came from his process is more organic and floaty than the usual venetian snares album tracks are as structurally dense and complex as ever but theres a preternatural softness around the manic beats that makes them easier to handle poignant melodies give the album grappling hooks even if only for a fleeting four minutes it means the loveliness of tracks like and quickly dissipates into a blurred memory venetian snares albums are usually tough and intense listens but can be fuzzy to a fault it lacks the internal turmoil that defines funks best music re are some edgy bits here like the acidic and manic but even these are more squeaky than spiky all of s smooth modular finesse funk is still better at leaving scars

between vantage point under his electro alias versalife and the conforce lp kinetic image boris bunniks discography has been getting ever bleaker almost too bleak in fact there is only so much mileage in his frosty emotionally monochrome landscapes bunniks younger alias is cut from much the same cloth as his main projects but last years red shift ep afforded him a chance to stray further from the dance floor its baleful downtempo and beatless explorations sounding like the forlorn chirruping of machines drifting through space its follow-up also on bunniks label feels more substantial though it isnt a radical change in outlook could be a conforce offcut its pointillist techno groove framing a single synth line that unfurls with languorous grace rumbles along like distant drexciyan thunder in the manner of a versalife track elsewhere there are more unusual delights opener is an excellent bit of kitschy sci-fi pomp and closer could be boogie if boogie hailed from the coldest reaches of the cosmos loping slow-mo techno number is almost sultry propelled by its pinprick hi-hats and the judicious application of a 303 at this point bunniks chops are indisputable but perhaps he ought to come in from the cold

fter two sturdy years spent mining a well defined sound s releases for have seen their core roster of artists reaching beyond their signature milieu drawing on a shifted set of influences taking chances and hoping that listeners will follow miles whittakers sole record this year is no exception passing on the monolithic dubby heft that was so essential to popular favorites new naloguecentury and dark days the sides title gives a conspicuous tip of the hat to robert hoods detroit: circle (recorded for troplex circa 1996) and whittaker roughly recreates the claustrophobia and dizziness of hoods spinning classic in his own track theres a fiercer and nastier agenda though to his heavy stereo panning is the weapon of choice and its applied so liberally that the tracks din of scissoring scrapes seems to circle just over the listeners head like a wake of vultures in wait very loud vultures the rhythm only heightens the sense of threat with unremitting quickened pulse kicks and astringent metallic stabs hammering away with harsh unchanging indifference of course isnt without precedent its dry sharp palette and severe resistance to variation already suggested on crossed swords s the side thatll have you doing a double take featuring a choppy remix of a track by one busted boombox rhythm introduces a track of jerky garish house until the honeyed keys arrive with some deep house cushion whittaker names this one his mix but before weve had time for that influence to sink in a plunging sub bass pattern veers us toward whittakers dubstep leaning work as millie s held together with wax and string but the cheap sounding pastiche works rather well and gives the record a looseness thats sometimes missed by the bass technicians at

s latest release retains the sense of narrative that made her genau 12-inch so refreshing on that 2016 record the russian artist found inspiration in unsuccessful tinder dates and being turned away from famous berlin clubs the lead track on suggests is more settled in the city brittle skipping drums ground the track in the now but amidst the glitches and backwards vocal snatches there is a uk garage-style harmony that wouldnt sound out of place in a jamie xx track s a curious combination of sounds that works because doesnt take herself too seriously that much is evident too on which finds experimenting with a dank basement vibe the 4/4 thud three-note bass loops and ravey keys create a raucous energy that fights for attention with the fizzing electric noise underneath the fatality sample lifted from mortal kombat that repeats throughout is another humorous touch was written in response to a negative facebook comment about a performance you can feel the sense of release as freeform synths billow out over a crunchy beatdown rhythm rich with detail
so far on weve had the nightmare lullabies of balam acab the fuzzy r b histrionics of how to dress well the imploded hip-hop of clams casino and many other nuggets of weirdness e of the few uniting factors in the labels nascent ethos however has been the reliable presence of pop-calibre melodies debut album from san franciscos flips this tendency on its head difficult and fussy the groups melodies are frustratingly tangential and the vocals are often atonal or distorted beyond recognition aim to be the sonic embodiment of that blurry watercolour painting that adorns : vocal samples smudge into rhythmic devices and sounds get lost in the muck but we can still try to reduce them down to a list of influences if we must: proto-industrial is all over this record from the demented march of the opener to more general characteristics like how the synths on tracks like flicker and wane fatalist beacons of light stolen from 20 jazz funk greats incorporation of analogue synthesizers and electronic elements connects them to the early works of coil and throbbing gristle specifically way the groups vocals trail off and bend into unnatural chord sequences recalls the primal anxiety of early nick cave and birthday party and when the vocals get caught up in the processors they sound like the eeriest moments of knife ( ) but while obvious touchstones are decades old their songs are powered by a diverse rhythmic engine taken from modern dance musics insatiable restlessness ir rhythms arent quite the quantized mechanisms preferred by the people they might crib from but the album is loaded with odd percussive turns or drum-heavy detours thrilling and dynamic stumbles from methodical into a beat that wouldnt sound too out of place next to blawan or pangaea and the howling vocals of is undercut by dulcet junglist pounding its these moments of rhythmic fruition that are the most promising and when their penchant for baroque melodrama collides with the twitchy garage references on in the the result is like little else like some of the best material on is simultaneously compelling and difficult its obsession with the macabre is both kitsch and kvlt but given a chance the album comes alive more than just a collection of dovetailing influences or hip outsider music references y feed into the labels darkness they leech off its preoccupation with the pop mainstream and they slot right into its weirdness: are an atypical band for an atypical label
tech house gets a bad rap but its easy to see why essentially the middle ground between two genres the potential is higher than usual for bland meldings of competing instincts listening to s latest offering for 20:20 vision thats exactly what you get: shiny house that sacrifices depth in favor of cleanliness and deep house that never sounds bright enough to truly crossover sounds like what happens when craft gets in the way of feeling its a beautiful piece of work elegantly constructed and probably has soundtracked more than one moment of bliss on the dance floor its typical chord progression rhythmic vocal and steady thump could have come from anyone though the same goes for -side slightly more distinctive its still nearly impossible to discern inside of its contents which consist of dubby chords those same rhythmic vocal accents (this time transferred to a male) and rising strings theres a certain romanticism to crafting music that seamlessly flows from the previous track to the next ut the tunes that people tend to remember are the ones with mistakes the songs which announce their presence simply fades into memory as soon as its ends pleasant and forgettable

sexxy the first track on s first ep after leaving rt department prominently featured a saxophone s instrument choices go it was a statement like shaving your hair off after a breakup it wasnt such a great track the groove was wooden the arrangement a little fussy but it showed his intention to create some distance from his collaboration with jonny white rt department was known for its druggy low-slung bass-driven sound a style that peaked in without you r s top track of 2010 sax aside in too deep the ep sexxy featured on had more of an overt dance floor focus than lots of the music white and lasgow wrote together the same goes for is a decently realised house track thats let down by a single detail: the spoken spanish vocal from the interplay between the arpeggiated synth quivering top line and lasgows simple laments is slick but anyone whos familiar with fragmas 1999 ibiza smash toca me is going to find it hard to love her contribution if you dj digitally consider creating a two-bar loop around the 30 second-mark on jori s remix at that point its a kicking electro drum tool but the flute-style synth the finnish veteran later pairs with lasgows vocal isnt a convincing match the diynamic music artist h o s h tightens up the decay on the originals bassline and tries out different melodic configurations with varying degrees of success overall the erman artist seems to be lacking a spark of inspiration something thats true elsewhere on the ep
its funny to think that honest jons is the place where damon lbarn has a hand in releasing some of candi statons more recent output in contrast with this mainstream pedigree its fast becoming one of the very most cutting-edge stables in underground electronic music the moritz von oswald trio ctress and soon the vladislav delay quartet are all on board and thats not even mentioning dubwise electronicas head witchdoctor arrives with and in tow here and it perhaps comes as no surprise to hear that this is shivery dank neo-gothic music of the highest calibre deftly programmed conga tracks wraithlike atmospherics and smooth smoky subbass undercurrents ll his trademarks are there whereas a lot of his tracks more or less centralise the hip-snaking conga rhythms though wraps them in reverb and submerges them flickers of flame at the end of a long dark corridor everyone starts from point one is the mantra on one which some may recognise from the aforementioned deadman whatever the hell that means the outlooks pretty bleak takes a tack reminiscent of utechre circa confield and makes it adhere to a constant tempo stuttering lurching greyscale rhythms are created from delay but rather than (what you might initially see as) random chaos they are in fact precisely placed in the sub-subdivisions between the notes start out with pure liquid bliss then descend into the depths of hell then find some kind of amalgam of the two as the cavernous breakbeat comes in destroyed with compression it immerses you in a melting pot of emotions and then locks a lid on top s with pretty much every other moment of this record you might be inclined to wonder what exactly this has to do with dubstep as we know it better question might be: who cares
to cap off a banner year pr ncipe ended the labels run with two records including the return of north lisbon kuduro crew blacksea n o mayo the three producers two brothers in their early 20s and and the 17 year old all contributed solo tracks to b n m / p d d g back in 2013 but collaboration is what drives mixing and matching their talents fosters a strong eclecticism across these six rhythmically dense productions though the young dominates the ep with five appearances and the only solo outing his dizzying is among the records best and might reveal where the trio gets some of their rich atmosphere and swift dynamics as heard on afro a contribution to warps cargaa 1 compilation blacksea n o maya have a soft spot for melody and emotive undercurrents benefits from flexing that muscle its the driving force behind a fidgety anthem of sorts that features the core trio with former collaborator bnm made a video for the song and as in those visuals its easy to envision the euphoric sample cut ups and poignant synth lines marking the high point of a long night out with friends s moon lit makes great use of melody too but holds back the emotion and tonal range for a more mysterious effect on perseguic a o the pair does pr ncipes riotous atonal beat melee with expectedly wild abandon which s cant quite match closing out the b side is the more traditional shuffle of comandante a fine club track whose approach feels somewhat out of place on an otherwise progressive ep
there are some names in the business that stand head and shoulders above the rest and must surely be one of those most of us will know terry for his partnership with pete heller in the 90s and of course others will know him from his the path project on junior with chris bangs who he teams up with once again here features the supremely sexy vocals of ann saunderson of kevin saunderson inner city fame and is a real cool groover of a track it was originally penned in for a release on the legendary junior records but somehow the guy s at distraekt must have made a good impression some how and they snapped it up with no hesitation and to finish this package off we have an awesome remix from label bosses piliavin zimbardo which will keep all you tribal and twisted heads happy out there due for release in august look out for that soon a must for all you tribal twisted freaks out there essential

at d sseldorfs salon des amateurs in 2013 i watched manipulate technics turntables to create loops with rubber bands sticky tape and little post it notes sometimes the bands broke but each time someone would reach into a box of spares and do a quick changeover it looked as if everything was on the verge of falling apart which made the performance engrossing s stuart leath has done more than most to get the music of (aka florian meyer stefan schwander and marc matter) and their various side projects schwander is lonious meyer is dont to the world a few years ago leath spotted the first 12 inch on diskant the label operated by the trio in the honest jons record shop on portobello road it was his introduction to a bustling community of d sseldorf musicians since then hes released records from many of the artists that orbit the salon des amateurs including lonious dont musiccargo and wolf m ller pulls together music that was released on diskant between 2009 and 2014 with a focus on meyer schwander and matter one thing that ties their solo and collaborative projects together is the use of vivid polyrhythms inspired by various strands of african and asian music at times these rhythms hang in stasis as on track sometimes the feeling is ritualistic ( ) and sometimes theres a brilliant sense of propulsive movement like on by lonious schwanders other solo effort the chiming is the eps most thrilling track while one of two dont selections bounces excitedly around the stereo field in the manner of steve reich for anyone whos intrigued by this particular corner of d sseldorfs music scene consider this record an ideal primer
jeremy sylvester and nathan e drake make up the aptly titled housebreakers - apt because of jeremys history in the uk house and garage scene combines with the breakbeat talents of nathan drake jeremy hasnt just limited himself to producing house hes also been responsible for releasing tunes like be-bop which found its way onto the stanton warriors cd and a release for mob records under the urban dubz guise is is the duos first official release and has already made an appearance on deekline ollywoods hardcore beats from the street cd in late 2003 side a original mix the original tune is the only version without the ragga twins vocals and concentrates its focus on a b-boy styled electro breakbeat incorporating a distorted guitar riff electro hook and vocodered vocals (giving rise to the title of the tune) theres even a few old skool electro hip hop samples and scratches thrown in big enough to rock the planet side aa1 breakerz mix for the breakerz mix nathan takes control of the boards and turns out a much darker and dirtier version of the tune keeping the vocodered robotic vocals in tact and rinsing out a much dirtier bassline the breakerz mix leans towards miami bass beats with its syncopated phrasing the ragga twins take their lead from this and deliver lycis like only they can - for those who liked their vocals on tunes like loko and coffee with aquasky vs masterblaster will get into this one side aa2 urban dubz crack house mix finally jeremy sylvester turns in a 4/4 house version of the tune reminiscent of the speed garage days of 1997 utilising a light hearted melodic bassline mixed with clangy hi-hats something for everybody here and all on a retro tip - b-boy electro dirty miami bass and 4/4 garage house its a useful platter however im going to have to side with the original
always one of dance musics more unconventional popular producers almost ten years into his career remains one of its most charming shapeshifters beginning with dirk leyers as half of closer musik one of the foundational acts who helped forge s gauzy brand of turn of the century minimal aguayo returned to the cologne label to issue one of its most bewildering and consistently engaging full lengths mid decade the skeletal hypnotism of solo debut are you really lost in the years since after two increasingly dank demented soul jazz singles his production style has evolved to the point where the relatively streamlined music of both his and dance musics recent past formed a titular joke for last summers swanky hedonistic smash 12 inch minimal though his new album finds birth on the label thats been such a big part of his past its sweaty studio jam playfulness owes far more to his new c meme imprint s street carnival aesthetic so organic so alive sounds informed by the bumbumbox parties aguayo and friends have been throwing around buenos aires of late: an urban boombox assault of sorts where aguayo et al play short dj sets culled from friends over the internet in large public spaces recorded variously in buenos aires chile paris and finally berlin draws from the heat and swagger the sense of loose loping developments of both south american and african cumbia and funk templates as foreseen on walter neff stitches aguayos voice into most of its melodic and rhythmic structures; his vocals are melded into every foundation part beat boxer part whistler and moaner part bizarre shower chanteur but for all its frolic theres a blurry sleeplessness threaded through the albums deranged chants the product of too many dim mad nights that settle into foggy mornings album revels in a narcotic half nod atmosphere aguayos always had a shrewd talent for inducing a trance without resorting to the forms crudest anthemic gestures with its tight lipped bum bum bum chants and cowbell flecked rhythms is three and a half minutes of chirpy aguayo delirium while the lean strutty will appeal to fans of walter neff s mesmerizing grooves atop punchy bass serene vocal moans and traditional african melodies simmers like a serengeti morning still far from midday boil still aint really just a barbecue jam it wouldnt be nearly as successful without maintaining a subtle narrative ebbing and its slimmer moments remove some of its lather lead single bumbles over several intersecting vocal parts vooms ta ca dattas and some kind of whoomp all sputtered out in rhythmic tandems likewise the title track forms a long steady gallop from nothing more than slow gummy bass tribal beats and aguayos vocal circus spills over its own edges its clattering rhythms and blurts of what might be an accordion left to shapeless play in a room scattered empty by night take advantage of it while it lasts for a breath or a sip of water its a moment of uneven restraint before the whole place starts to shake anew
the name may be familiar to many of you after their massive club track camels made a big impact worldwide not so long ago they return to their beloved label to deliver their ep which continues in their filtered disco house sound ashra gets straight to the point with a quirky melody that rides the deep funky baselines that is known for uses a good arrangment that sees the track build in and out and also uses cut ins and random effects for the dancefloor to react to the uniquely named toilet is far from the quality that the title suggests in fact this may be the strongest production on the ep for me the baseline yet again does the damage while an electro synth melody gives it a good vibe in the breakdowns quirky yet bags of fun we desire is the ladies friendly anthem on the ep with the use of a housey vocal sample looped over the baseline fuelled beats and somewhat retro vibes not bad but perhaps the weakest link on the ep it s time cranks the tempo a little bit and makes good use of higher end sounds while the beats and deeper base chug along in the background not a bad ep from and one that will definitely appeal to the house heads looking to take the tempo up in their sets it appears definitely knows how to work the floors with this ep a clear example

were psyched enough about these edits from oston party-hounds that they founded a sub-label just to get them out sensible move: s reworkings of two lost soul classics neatly complement the spare but expressive deep house vibe that the rooklyn crew have been steadily developing its as if armed with a primary aesthetic conceit are open to experimenting with its transformation across a plateau of possibilities its a smooth shadowy and yes deep sound like a velvet cavern which wouldnt be an inaccurate way to describe the marcy hotel wolf+lambs diy rooklyn headquarters ill refrain from trainspotting the two soul jams here in order to leave some of the mystery up to you: suffice to say theyre neither completely obscure finds nor top 40 motown classics that your mom loves oth have been sliced up to plumb the murky fathoms of hypnotic dance music landing not far from super-trippy edit classics like todd terjes cut of chics i want your or cole medinas stunning rework of you inside out by the ee gees -side is a butter-smooth 70s lover-man joint that has largely been left intact looped and beefed up with a kick and hat its the sort of minor tweak that might irk those who insist on originality in all forms of art but complaining that an edit isnt original is like criticizing a dj for playing songs other people recorded t its best an edit can function like a mini-dj set exploring peaks and valleys differences and repetitions all within the confines of a single track in that sense edit can be just another name for mix which only adds to the terminological confusion youve perhaps faced if youve ever sat down and tried to figure out exactly what the difference is between a mix a remix an edit a dub a club version and so on theres more noticeable manipulation on the where a lovely 80s cut gets tailspun into a gorgeous whirlpool of floating echo and dubbed-out sunshine here adeptly pull off the sort of seductive build-and-release that more often than not can maximize a dance vocals sensual pleasure allowing it to roam half-formed in the background for a spell before allowing it only on occasion to appear in the fullness of its splendor throw this over crisp machinic beats and call it intimate club: hard enough for the floor smooth enough for the back room

returns with a new 12 on traum that has been handcrafted for the darker corners of the dancefloor the side bl ten sind dem fremd drives directly towards the dancefloor in a straight line and doesn t stop driving for 11 minutes dark throbbing bassline carries the track along giving it a nervous energy rushing in straight lines towards a number of peaks interestingly eulberg never lets the track fully climax on any of these peaks instead holding back and using the build ups as chances to introduce new elements in true minimal style this restraint creates a satisfying tension although it may not be to the tastes of those who want a track that has an identifiable start climax and finish s a consequence this is definitely a track designed for dj use but in the hands of the right dj this will get a dancefloor moving nicely the b side totenkopfschw rmer im doesn t move along the straight lines the side does instead starting off with a much more hip shaking bassline we still begin in fairly dark minimal territory though with a jaded male vocalist singing tell me do you love me tell me do you hate me in slightly accented english the track seems all set to be a dark brooding minimal slow burner when the twist comes fter a few minutes in the track slows down and then absolutely explodes ripping into a rocking electro bassline that lter ego would be proud of as flurries of drums go off and bleeps and lasers fire off all over the place it s a fantastically executed rock out moment that should have a dancefloor going absolutely nuts the tracks on -hommage are definitely dancefloor material and excellent dancefloor material at that they also see eulberg expanding his sound moving in a slightly darker direction he s still working within the style that s roughly called minimal but he s clearly experimenting and trying new things it s a healthy sign for the evolution of both eulberg and the minimal movement
originally released as a tape in 2012 marked a difficult transition for chloe harris the seattle-based producer and co-head of before she made experimental synth music as harris toured the world as a progressive house dj and close associate of john digweed an artist who couldnt be further removed from the music on harris says the tape (now a record) was the sound of her trying to claw her way out of that world or at least find a new one looking back on it now is a stunning document of vulnerability and volatile inspiration couched in seriously experimental mind-bending music on harris interrogates empty space with eight different plans of attack though the album was made with just a few synthesizers and samplers each new song sounds like it could have been made in a different studio altogether what unites them is their use of tactile texture against stark backgrounds and cavernous chambers of reverb the synths on collect from a splatter of liquid into squeaky high-pitched resonance and back again dissolving the barrier between artificial and natural-sounding elements plays with sandpapery white noise patches and takes the bulbous synths of dub techno and lets them snake through the empty air few of harriss tracks have any discernible direction but thats not a bad thing it only adds to their emotional resonance though at first her tracks can be hard to digest theres a yearning on that brings them to life motifs repeat in irregular patterns coming in delayed bursts or compressing and stretching out at random its a technique thats used to best effect on the wistful closer entridam where long synth leads curl like calligraphy but flatten and feather as if the pen was held down on the page too long its a simple track but there are worlds of feeling hidden in the folds of those sustained tones the sound itself becomes a vessel for expression and emotion though shes released more focussed records since first came out this reissue affirms the album as harriss most beguiling and definitive work yet
the crew from groovepleasure return with a release that follows the very impressive effort from nathan coles this time a are the production outfit and they make their mark on the label with a good solid 2 track release first up is the very impressive true from the word go this production oozes with energy with the beats flowing nicely and at a pretty good pace the baselines roll along nicely adding a good groove to the track and while the keep the track with a good groove; nice smooth melodies and stabbing effects give the production more then just that good groove nice vocals come into the track midway giving it yet another level and making it a very nice track on the whole release is on the flip and despite the somewhat overused vocal sample the track is more then just another used trick smooth beats combine well with a very chunky baseline as well as more good use of atmosphere just like the a-side another good release from this label and with a release from terry francis up next expect the quality to keep on coming from groovepleasure
with his two-original-tracks-a-year work ethic is not the most productive artist around if there was something remotely special and distinct about prototype his 2004 over-the-top electro anthem that kinda sat weirdly next to the other releases from that period he then distilled it with various remixes for client ( radio ) the prodigy ( girls ) and depeche mode ( photographic ) which might explain why his stuff usually gets a polarized reception that said there is something quite unique about rex s use of the arp2600 synth something about its grain (as french thinker roland barthes would say) that is if not original at least instantly recognizable on his new 12 for it seems won t rally anyone new to his cause at first title track sounds like prototype on crystal meth but after a few listens a definite victory emerges as if you d just won a marathon without having any legs nor arms on the flip sequencer has a definite and welcome old-skool vibe like something orbital or 808 state would have been proud of in 1992 albeit somewhat grittier then rex dares singing on everyday and damn it he is pretty good at it the track ends up being both melancholic and ecstatic at the same time: just a reminder that our sometimes favorite dog is justifiably part of the stable after all
s santiago gets a remix touch up here with another effort from themselves as well as a guy gerber reworking the st james mix has a great feel to it as well with a good drive and flow to the production helped with some nice intricate melodies and a smooth and driving bassline it s quite a worthy remix from that adds to the original the guy gerber hot rod mix is a great remix and probably the best remix of the release there is a gritty feel throughout with some tougher electro riffs and the drums are quirky and interesting as is the eerie high pitched melody that works its way throughout the production very tasty stuff here from gerber
a production duo pairing florian schirmacher and helmut ebritsch does deep dubby techno in a way that has certainly been done before but always stands at the ready to feast on any given moment over a steady metronomic tap slathered with warm rich pads (from the duos album synchronicity ) plays as a meditation with spoken vocals murmuring trails of oblique messages: sitting at the seaside sharing time through my veins i was free deeper and deeper daedalos doles out a short spurt of chiming keyboard chords before ups the tempo considerably leaning a deep throb into a sort of mellow house saunter and stretching out over 13 minutes the running time gives a leisurely lean with little in the way of change over the course of it but a sense of intimacy that grows more and more warm thanks in part to close-miked vocals that sound like inner thoughts escaped through a thin crack a j geramann zuckermann remix treads lightly over very similar terrain with a slightly more electronicized sound that drops about halfway through into a deep bassline groove its heavier and more suited for the floor but theres a sense of secrecy about it just the same
on this ep recorded at a live show in paris in 2006 brings in guests that will make trainspotters weep with joy longside mr craig himself we have detroit jazz don wendell harrison on clarinet and saxophone as well as pianist/composer kelvin sholar and ur main man mad mike anks on keyboards so what do they do with these two classics the case of they subtly tweak it the original the keyboard dictates the subtle shifts in mood even when the euphoric synths come in live the clarinet pipes up early and steals that role and when the track gets going it soars in a delirious manic improvisation side from that the end goes a bit like an outtake from the lade runner soundtrack for about thirty seconds instead of just trailing off t by contrast is turned into an epic opus and thats not just on account of the near doubling of length theres still the familiar echoing tune just about danceable rhythm and pulsing bassline but theyre balanced by the addition of more interpretative saxophone and keyboards the keyboards are more prominent in the live version of and the superlong angelic notes conjure up images of distant night time cityscapes without the beat this would arguably be a free jazz track and the way it warps between jazz techno and something in between gives it an intriguing and compelling appeal full of praise as i am for these tracks i cant see them appealing much beyond the faithful because like -sides and rarities theyre a bit specialised thats a shame because especially in the case of the live version of t theyre arguably better than the originals

s dreamscape techno might seem to some like the banal illegitimate crossbreeding james holden and gui boratto but the british producer actually has more in common with fellow traum acts such as extrawelt fairmont and applescal whereas the latters productions are infused with idm and sometimes even d b traces coopers and released over the past two years are abstract yet elegiac pieces moody trance-inducing techno on this itunes-exclusive ep coopers productions are viscerally captivating constantly morphing in front us like aural kaleidoscopes is especially absorbing as it alternates between waves distorted white noise and remote moments where a mischievous bassline and abstract vocal snippets wander around an empty space but overall the compressed edits proposed here feel frustratingly laconic: shortening an eight-minute long odyssey to a three-minute teaser doesnt really render justice to coopers craft one should stick then to the more engrossing originals releases real surprise comes from the exclusive ambient rework a truly sublime beatless tour de force that recalls philip glass aphex twins most serene moments and even henryk goreckis symphony no 3 compared to the three other radio-friendly tracks that precede it it just draws attention even more to their length deficiency and only insists on how coopers emotive electronica needs time to beatifically settle in
horsepower productions arent back they never went away theyve always kept things open and loose functioning as a roving collective with ben benny ill garner and matt levesconte as the core production duo the gap between releases has widened over the years but thats only because the guys manage other commitments and of course writing albums takes time especially the way horsepower do it their tracks are built around samples mostly from films using the same production techniques theyve been relying on since the beginning like the cinema narratives they borrow from horsepower albums are dense with subtext and nuanced storytelling crooks crime corruption the groups fourth full-length for might sound like a divergence at first hip-hop starts things off on opening up to psychedelic delta blues on smokey house on and latin 4/4 flavours on wheres the bass the dubstep the garage its all there largely propping up the albums latter half but those sounds arent exclusively what horsepower are about nor really have they ever been their mixtapes span a number of genres and the music they dj varies depending on the party and the crowd jungle is their default sound hence capping off crooks in a drum n bass for papa kind of way levesconte and garner both come from a rave and acid house background garners solo music predates horsepower productions by close to a decade and includes a hefty catalogue of techno and idm collaborations with bill robin fuller considering these eclectic tastes crooks crime corruption might just be the most bare-all horsepower productions record putting all that history and variety of influence on display the groups ability to transcend genres and eras gives crooks a unique agelessness still the question remains: in what does a horsepower productions album mean for for dubstep and for an aging scene still soldiering on an answer might be in the words of sampled from gil scott-herrons delta man over a backdrop of rainforest sounds the poet drawls this is a song about change you see / we say many things about the changing aspects of our lives / we say that since change is inevitable we should direct the change / rather than simply continue to go through the change with crooks crime corruption horsepower productions seem to follow that wisdom

a taster for their second long player movements night falls sees top berlin electrohouse duo and get physical impresarios in a playful mood expectations are now sky high: body language was voted ibiza track of the summer 2005 and was justifiably caned by every dj worth his salt (and pete tong) the follow-up mandarine girl was simply lovely: a reinvention of trance that resurrected the dreaded panpipe preset and my track of 2005 and i don t even like electrohouse night falls deserves more than one listen: it ll intrigue more if you know its destination midway between an album track (it opens movements ) and a club cut for the early crowd to hum along to before they get fed up and leave the trademark hollow bass real drums and floatation tank synths resolve into an attitude just the right side of inoffensive humility not quite the gem it wishes it was (that accolade goes to in white rooms my track of thus far i know boring) night falls might lack the rhythmic insistence to move more stubborn dancefloors but i just can t stop listening to it trespass06 is get physical goes m_nus: minimal techno of the just-one-riff-will-do tony iommi school but instead of mucking about with plips and plops it s a seven-minute fight with a broken arpeggiator in theory this sounds like manna from heaven and the track has a huge build and payoff yet somehow the distortion detracts electronic music is like socks: best if clean of course on the platter of the right dj i m sure it could slay (don t we say this about everything ) third cut the spectralist pitchshifts percussion listlessly until a sergio leone build rises up spookily out of the clatter to kneel down in front of you and present (groan) dark acid electrohouse it s annoying as fuck but onto the intriguing question what is a spectralist a quick google spits up the juice: spectralism is a musical genre originating in france in which waveforms are broken down and then recreated into musical forms hmm this sounds a lot like what do: by the power of sheer synth boffinism they take apart the big bassline and melodic hook of electrohouse sharpen up the worn parts and create a new machine the result is that the smile and wiggle the music trigger are genuine

im an old school nigga with a new school flow so go the opening lyrics from however do you want it one of the standout tracks from s debut album i wouldnt go that far but thats not to say the album lacks imagination for the blackpool group have taken the approach that if it aint broke then it doesnt need fixing there are a variety of tonal colours surrounding the vocalists the bright brass of the opening title track giving way to the easy melancholia of never simple or the darker introspective dear diary if you like an easier jazz style theres the dreamy dimes got or for a heavier instrumental sound heavyweight takes a familiar riff and slows it down several trans-atlantic guests give this album a cosmopolitan flavour with sage dimes and dirt diggla (brilliant name ) giving plenty of incisive chat and variety the lyrics are always interesting my favourite being the assertion on 24 7 that boy bands make grands on a skill they lack it took seven years for this album to reach the shelves so dont hold your breath for the follow up if you like the grand central sound though and theres plenty that do youll find a lot to enjoy here
recent visitors to our shores ltj bukem and mc conrad release their latest offering in their live progression sessions this one being recorded in the liquid room tokyo japan in early feburary ltj picks a stunning mix of tunes while mc conrad delivers fast paced rhymes and lyrics utilising his microphone effects machine keeping the crowd hyped at the same time starting off the mix mc conrad invites the crowd to make some noise and also introduces his selectah to fire up the wheels of steel - its time to get busy greenflys g-funk is the perfect start to the mix a soulful jazzy drumnbass effort with a trumpet and keyboard solos herbie hancock jazz-supremo gets his essence remixed by bukem himself and continues on from where g-funk left off - still riding on that jazz-funk fusion tip conrad sings along with the female vocals on this track in a call and response routine kymeras secrets picks up the pace and mood a little bit and the drumbeats have a nice syncopated feel to them what is a drumnbass mix without a rewind this is the first track in the mix to get a rewind and rightfully deserves it - that beat just sounds really nice nookies innerspace has a very rapid beat that sounds like someone banging away at a typewriter to make drumnbass beats (well not really) but its that lush soulful drumnbass sound that is so prominent in this mix and mc conrad compliments it very well with his singing and mc-ing style the western by pfm gets mixed in next and is a really atmospheric drumnbass effort this track also called for a rewind and rightfully deserved it the old western gun sounds near the end give it that western feel local perth producer greg packer contributes a summer breeze to this mix its good to see the locals getting attention from big names in the scene and with this tracks conga rhythms female vocals and horn stabs its sure to cause mayhem on the dancefloors makoto contributes three tracks for this mix namely music has never let me down my soul and bukem finishes the mix off with you make me feel with his passion for that atmospheric chilled out drumnbass its not hard to see why ltj picked three of his tracks for the live set nice 11 tracks and around 60 minutes later im pretty sure the listener would be left hungry for more its a different feeling seeing things done live if the tracks didnt grab you then it would be: a) ltjs mixing style as he cuts drops and rewinds his way through each of the 11 tracks or; b) mc conrads mc style which does not get too intrusive during the mix or; c) both bukems and conrads style complimenting each other perfectly or; d) all of the above as a bonus the 2nd cd is a live studio instrumental mix of the 11 tracks minus conrad this makes for perfect background music and should make a nice accompaniment to any activity tracklisting: 1 greenfly - g-funk 2 herbie hancock - essence (bukems dj mix) 3 kymera - secrets 4 nookie - innerspace 5 pfm - the western (mikes ricohet remix) 6 makoto - musica has never let me down 7 greg packer - summer breeze 8 soul purpose - falling 9 makoto - my soul 10 org lounge - une femme da la mystique 11 makoto - you make me feel
brooklyn-based producer michael morrison has a knack for wistful driving house which hes made clear on his 100 silk releases and dj mixes his last release as februarys more times ep for running back is a good primer for his first deepblak 12-inch as glowing atmosphere and unwavering propulsion have once again returned to the fore blends sturdy bass jabs and big drifting chords with filtered vocal flecks in its satisfying brew future is morrison in full bliss-out mode but under its early-90s warp pads theres still that driving undercurrent that seems to move everything he produces the flip starts out with a bump on which trades in silky-smooth linearity for bass-driven club-ready bounce it doesnt make quite the same impact as closer however that one rests on an instantly memorable synth line taking us back to the deeply atmospheric house that morrison works so well with

in 2011 a year after releasing an exceptional deep house record called drafting under the stars threw away all his gear and stopped making music he was depressed from a broken heart he later explained to stamp the wax meanwhile drafting slowly became a sleeper hit its b-side jump rope music was a favorite among djs like move d and floating points (though as far as im concerned the title track is where its at) riding this boost in recognition matsumoto got back in the groove and started making more music than ever appearing on labels like meda fury and clones royal oak his records were good but none hit the same heights as drafting until his latest released on the niigata-based label is an ecstatic record full of twirling melodies glitchy vocals and the cascading synths that are matsumotos calling card umbrella and all have a glistening sun-showery atmosphere the latter is for my money the records best track thanks to its stuttering rhythm and relatively bittersweet mood puts the same elements in a more relaxed arrangement strutting along at a cool 114 bpm sweettrainsuite might be a bit much for some its unabashedly happy with a heavy streak of kawaii but it also feels sincere more than just a club record this is emotional music that sticks with you

released in 2014 s tour tour wasnt a remarkable album but it did well to convey what the french trio are about behind the decks namely warm groovy us-indebted house music it offered the kind of simple yet well-produced club tracks that would appeal to potential remixers 18 months on from tour tour three remix eps have emerged via music featuring eight artists from across the house spectrum thomas melchior at one end the brothers at the other the new york siblings guest on the second 12-inch installment alongside lola ed dj/producer terence : : and gieglings edward remixing excels when artists from different musical worlds collide offering a fresh and invigorating perspective on the original material (obvious example: masters at work and uk garage producers taking on mainstream pop hits in the 90s ) as is both terence : : and the brothers share too much in common with for their efforts to catch fire the formers subdued balmy version of is pleasant enough but it sounds like it couldve been made by themselves the creepy chug of the brothers se or is more distinctive but again its a rolling drum track built for the same dance floors that dan ghenacia shonky and dyed soundorom play to edwards remix however is a different story he applies his misty touch to arguably the albums best track tightening the burly breakbeat and showering it in a panoply of beautiful feathery sound its a balance of light and dark soft and hard that in lesser hands may have felt overly sentimental here edward hits all the right notes
how to wring optimism from tragedy how to go about day-to-day life in the wake of senseless violence se are the questions real name c cile schott grapples with on her sixth album first track on is called the month schott visited an ailing relative in france and stopped off for a night in her former home paris to drop off her viola bow for repair she walked in the sunshine and had dinner with friends n came the deadly attacks on caf s restaurants and the bataclan for the next months all i could think about especially at night was death she recalled own death the death of people i love the death of complete strangers couple of weeks after the events though i managed to shake myself out of inaction and started working on the record fate and the passing of time have always played a part in schotts work re are two chapters to her career thus far leaf records years 2003 through 2007 when she released three acclaimed albums and a mid-10s comeback era in between she experienced a six-year creative block big difference now she said upon the release of her 2015 lp captain of none is that i get this sense that my time is limited im not sure how many albums i have within me and i realize that i dont have any time to waste brush with tragedy that inspired likely brought this urge into sharper focus and its resulted in s most immediate and affecting lp to date schott has always been quick to change her approach on her debut everyone live wants nswers she raided parisian music libraries for samples later schott trained as a guitarist became associated with the viola da gamba fter her time off she started singing in the lead-up to she stumbled across a critter guitari pocket piano in king britts philadelphia studio she ordered one immediately and planned on using it to accompany her viola when that wasnt working she ordered a larger critter guitari model the septavox and recorded the entirety of her new lp with those two synths moog delay and filter pedals and her voice schott plays these keyboards as though she designed them herself t times the arrangements deftly mirror her plaintive naturalistic vocals on she sings of death from the world / is like a drop of rain / falling to the ocean floor as the synth burbles in the deep on she begins by singing the stars will have the last word / nd outshine us before mirroring that twinkling expanse on her minimal setup vocals delivered softly still manage to hit like a sledgehammer in part due to their infrequency instrumentals on are equally compelling on she coaxes a kick drum-like figure out of her synths and pedals then hammers pensive arpeggiated chords for six minutes evincing a hopeful futurism conjures the bliss thats made kompakts pop mbient series such an enduring institution but on the closing title track she toggles off the arpeggiator and reduces the synth to a simple organ drone a la nicos desertshore mournful refrain i will call you / when the sun has reached the final hour rings out and the album fades on dolorous chords
strangely this decidedly merican house cut has ended up on reboot and sascha dives from frankfurt to manheim mix despite its creator being a 30 year veteran of the us electronic scene and a resident at nycs cielo for the past three having spent a lifetime playing with the likes of louis vega and frankie knuckles its no wonder theres an underlying old school vibe throughout patterson isnt ignorant of newer sounds however as he brings it into the here and now with a little 00s glitch the original has a sort of booty shaking ghetto tech edge that youd be likely to find on a jay haze record: unresolved and persistent bass concertinas jerk up and down from start to finish its almost in the reboot/johnny d loopy techno fold though their cuts are a little more free flowing and liquid where the heart of this track is brash and inert the only relief being a rippling chord which drips down from above on the little changes: there are slashing synth sweeps to start which stir a jittery tick into life only for it to then percolate right to the end adding a little gumption to the originals frigid jack searching fluttery high line is the only other addition keeping the track from being too austere but limiting it to dance floor tool status rather than expanding it into any sort of essential selection
following a series of engagements with his own mental disorder label which recently saw him reimagine kafkas the metamorphosis in suitably eerie trippy fashion reeko returns to his second home polegroup with something a little more club-ready contrary to the name covers the whole palette starting off smoothly with the percolating indeed moody is the best way to describe the eps title track which grows like an angry storm cloud: black thick and charged with electricity refusing to erupt the static energy instead builds toward a venomous crescendo before cooling down is the ambient reprieve the deep breath in and cathartic exhalation at least until more of that reeko menace blows in on a rush of noise and distortion it leaves a ringing in your ears almost like a reminder to hold your guard what sounds like crashing waves swirls around the heartbeat of as it proceeds to chug towards its inevitable conclusion in terms of sound and composition this one is the standout ties things off with growling creaking dub thats so heavy it might leave you groping around for something a little lighter

rio padice and massimo di lena are members of naples early sound collective alongside leskin both have discographies dating back a good few years padice typically exploring a softer deep house sound di lena something a little more upfront this ep for follows di lenas excellent hardlife ep whose chunky title track found an admirer in ben ufo among others and settles on a neat goldilocks zone between the two producers styles se raw but light-footed analogue excursions cast padice and di lena as a friskier version of the analogue cops although in contrast to the often meandering live-jam style these tracks are concise and tightly arranged rz is a louche number with crunchy percussion its curt acid bassline a persistent pleasure is a little more thunderous with a red-raw bassline and hi-hats that seem to be splitting under the weight of distortion is the only minor misfire its flaccid kick drum not quite proving an adequate foundation for the defective-circuitry synth work going on above
has bought us italo disco soundtracks as gianni rossi edits as lovelock on mindless boogie miscellaneous synth epics as half of zombi and more italo as half of miracle hes also in a rock band via discogs i count 24 albums moores been involved with plus a solo lp shortly to be released as lovelock prolific diverse and slightly mysterious hes mericas answer to legowelt under his own name it seems as if more consideration is paid to contemporary dance floors s always however its with the aid of analogue synths not 303s 808s or 909s but the spooky early vintage kind that are played rather than sequenced the eponymous track opens with a minute or so of such synth it has a dystopian bladerunner -esque quality slowly sucking away whatever cheer you might have had mood established they quickly retreat allowing a plodding rhythm to take hold consisting only of a kick muted clap and tipsy metronomic synth this replacement has a conforce-like feel; simple but impeccably crafted moore doesnt seem keen on fancy tricks: the biggest moment in comes when the two lines abruptly re-combine to trudge defeatedly to the finish though composed of relatively bright sounds tykens also carries some feeling of hopelessness; the soundtrack to a crews valiant self-sacrifice in deep space gain this mood is achieved using fairly simple techniques: an abrasive low-end generating the tension and several trance-inspired arps orbiting rapidly above what makes it special however is how perfectly everything crescendos together orchestrated by an uprising cosmic pad the tracks zenith is incredibly natural inescapably drawing you in like a looming black hole ncient is even more dramatic with two arps sprinting frantically alongside one another for eight straight minutes this in itself in no great feat but moores small supporting cast irregular kicks more cosmic pads add emphasis in all the right places
s melodies are a gentle alternative to the more complicated corners of dance music through releases on lets play house puss (the label he runs with countryman korn l kov cs) and johan cederbergs tracks arent often built for flashy dance floor lift offs but for more tranquil landings fans were left saddened in winter of 2015 when cederberg announced he was giving up djing due to personal health issues his production hiatus has been just as long cederberg has now quietly returned with a single-sided 12-inch on called which is swedish for take a break the record features six short cuts is warm ambient while the crackly guitar strumming of ( thirty ) could hint at the self-reflection one goes through when they reach their fourth decade ( to you ) a deliciously downtempo mix of piano keys synth doodles and barely-there drums could be a nod to fans who remained patient in lieu of new music s unfussy comeback finds him at his most innocent feels like a deeply personal meditation
two years after his first long player is back on his own label (and in a fitting association with turbo) with a new artist album titled as the name suggests the subtler side ridha has developed on his remixes for the likes of feist (the still weirdly poignant my moon my man ) and s bastien tellier (his two versions of lamour et la violence are particularly stellar) is put aside for something more uncompromising altogether as a result compared to oi oi oi is colder squarer more direct and unsparing thats both a blessing and a curse putting aside his distortion boxes and his dizzying plug-ins on most of the 12 tracks here is basically offering a speed-charged boosted version of himself sure first single and are predictably all flashy stabs and sharp angles but it shouldnt leave a negative shadow on the more adventurous moments elsewhere is the albums true pi ce de r sistance a kaleidoscopic piece of stubborn techno that isnt ashamed to include a pristine ultra-simple melody amongst various buzz and ear-piercing twirls: it doesnt really seem to know where it is going (incidentally it fades out in an unsurprising way) but it does show a newly discovered sense of exploration tracks like and are even more stubborn sparse and uncompromisingly unmelodic like aphex twin at his most obtuse then you have cuts like which sound like a playful early 90s r s leftover; similarly morphs from early techno la joey beltram to ecstatic acidic mayhem album closer even recalls plaid with a second-hand beatbox and a broken heart sees ridha taking maximalist techno back to its roots by bringing its core components to the forefront while getting rid of the rowdy tics negatively attached to n -rave its like he wanted these tracks to be played by his personal hero carl craig as much as by lets say erol alkan (with whom he also recorded maximal-by-numbers cuts waves and death suite earlier this year) in that regard the album does have an overall brutal effectiveness that is both impressive and consistent that said it seems like ridha couldnt help but resurrect some of technos very own clich s either as seems clinical formulaic even slightly stiff a feeling that is only enhanced by the recurring use of menacing robotic vocals as his previously mentioned remix works have proven ridha can function perfectly well in warmer surroundings: his take on so-called n -rave would probably benefit from the input of actual vintage human emotions something that is only hinted at only briefly here

s fans of are undoubtedly familiar with by now their second offering from is a one-sided 12-inch printed in two hundred copies and listed with a no repress tag nd like most of the labels catalog would be a solid acquisition even if it wasnt the subject of a tantalizingly-small print run its a spiraling hydra-headed detroit-style jam whose most valuable asset is its unpredictability theres not a straight bar of eight beats throughout the whole thing just as the ears and the body have locked into the 808 groove it jerks out from under you stubbornly refusing to settle instead sidewinding through a mildly hyperactive workout making pit-stops among stiffly arpeggiated bass samples and bursts of synth-pads finally dead-ending in an echoey cluster of percussive white noise its memorable more for the effect of its overall structure and flow rather than any particular riff or standout sound are no strangers to classic dance music shaboo their previous single revisited early 90s feel-good house and wouldnt be easily distinguishable from its ancestors if put to a blind taste test with instead of merely aping the past or grafting strands of it onto the present have gone and mulched up a good chunk of it in a blender the tune sounds like the result of some frankensteinian megamix where deep in their lab outside of lisbon the duo have transformed a heap of disembodied sonic fragments into a hoary undead kevin saunderson joint s such its a good history lesson both in style and in name: fear of returning to the classics and then no fear of tearing them apart
is morgan geist is morgan geist the debate will rage on just as heavily after the release of the newest from environ geists brooklyn imprint without any evidence to the contrary though its hard not to believe that oliver is some sort of id-tastic counterpart to geists un-persona as one-half of metro area oliver swaggers in on hi-nrg synths and stiff disco cowbell on vocals pitched low and describing a physical relationship but soon more synths arrive curling upward like a sad smirk as the vocal effects suddenly drop out and were left with a decidedly human voice reminding us that he has feelings too baby o gets his mojo back on the b-side: hes the titular back to the pitched-down guise and ready to rock and i do mean rock doesnt feature guitars but it sounds ripped straight from the playbook of nine-inch-nails-does-dance-music down to the wordless affirmatives that show up to hum along at various points that may not sound like an endorsement but the immaculate production and frighteningly powerful build-up should tell you otherwise
berlins has been quiet for the last couple of years at least in terms of releases under his own name the gentle electronic pop of saschienne a collaboration with his wife julienne dessagne has been occupying much of his time making this two-tracker his first solo release since 2011s brave lp and his first for since 2001 never an artist prone to dramatic stylistic shifts finds funke mining the same kind of lush techno he always has while also acknowledging the influence of dessagne the title track is as hypnotic as it is propulsive with accordion-like keys washing over a vocal loop and calm drums the keys eventually morph into slow-and-low piano notes ending the track even more gracefully than it began on the flip s distinguishing feature is its little rockabilly guitar lick soft-focus -style percussion and the occasional tumble of high keys add just enough oomph to a track that stretches itself out like an old cat basking in the afternoon sunshine
like most engrossing art dominick fernows project poses more questions than it answers once described as music for assassins on the world-scale board game upon which it isnt clear who is winning or what side you are on fernow has referenced hillary clinton david koresh and the flight 93 hijacker ziad jarrah in its track titles and artwork but has stopped short of asserting a political stance through fernow has focused on techno hes released on modern love and blackest ever black and while much of his techno is rudimental its usually evocative the first release from his unlikely alliance with strips away the amateur production touches of past releases while maintaining the projects somber tone opening track is a lush cocteau twins-esque bath that bears the touch of its co-producer josh eustis of telefon tel aviv and tropic cancer fernow follows with two brooding expertly produced techno tracks retains the hushed funereal mood of his best work only now the buzzing drones and searchlight synths rest on clear nuanced drums widescreen closer uses a tb-303 glide against brooding chords landing close to john tejada and tin mans recent collaborative work for fernow the end of the world doesnt come with a bang but a whimper
someone needs to come up with a name for what chileans are doing with techno it s a sound that s becoming increasingly pervasive with producers as far as romania revelling in extended percussive squirm a match as bizarre as finl s obsession with tango currently genre sits in a conceptual grey area between minimalist understatement latin swing nineties glitch but se comparisons fail to adequately explain scope intent behind se productions these pieces by three chilean producers on cadenza are archetypal examples of chilean techno (or whatever you want to call it): all are original exciting nervous numbers ( wildly different) like rhadoo s recent release for label offer nothing to substantiate luciano s recent claim of digging house ronan fitzgerald s criticism of that record being too experimental could well be applied here but in this instance it s a precocious form of experimentalism utterly charming s original has a playful pop house bounce to it with risqu jg ballard esque auto erotic lyrics that put it in n ze category of disco smut but this is weird even by n ze s st ards it s as though entire track has been constructed out of car parts: soft drums thunk like break pads backdrop is covered in metallic pings taps it rocks to fro like a junker but for all this it remains sparse with jorge gonz lez s vocals pitched high low everywhere in between ( familiar to all through villalobos version) lending it an air of prince these elements all appear misjudged incongruent but like a faithful jalopy it works result is both strangely groovy easily likeable d y s version of you (from s forthcoming album) is even more obtuse with pinprick scatter filling gaps between retro space tones hinted at percussion there s a psychedelic touch in liberal use of effects like vintage dub tropicalia with congas vague snatches of voice left drowning in processing but re s also development that s what keeps you following slippery threads burrowing through rhythm like termites villalobos s wd mix centrepiece of his fabric set is actually most immediately straightforward thing here or perhaps his quirks are just subtler like most of his work it feels somewhat lacking out of context 13 minutes of almost imperceptible movement a finger click clap voice chopped into a rhythmic huh but again action is in rustling detail buzzing in e r its highly compelling this is a confusing release but one i cant stop playing it although i must confess to not knowing quite what its about luciano tobias are next up should be just as perplexing techno needs se mysteries

calling your label is a pretty clear statement intent and the title this ep by and the fluffy clouds artwork are further clues that this isnt exactly going to be metal machine music sure enough these two sleepily melodic house cuts are a kind aural balm this fourth release on lee urridges label sees the canadian producers collaborate on one track and go it alone on the other s is led by a twinkling glockenspiel riff and subtle pads that would fit neatly into the dreamier strata kompakts output n equally head in the clouds vocal muses on the strongest love completing a serene picture his collaboration with t pulses along in a similarly winsome way even more meditative than the first track it glides through its ten minutes on a cloud glowing harmonies and gently clicking percussion doesnt go anywhere but then it isnt supposed to
revivalism inspires skepticism case in point future garage is often accused of being light on the future and heavy on the garage: 2-step scrubbed clinically clean and encased in amber swing skip records debut single strives to dispel this notion capturing the sublime of urban life while confidently moving the conversation forward produced by montreal resident immediately distinguishes itself through its reverberating percussion and rumbling sub-frequencies lessed with plenty of open space the dubwise intro and steady groove firmly anchor the track in the shadows bypassing any champagne-glitz nostalgia nd when the tracks neon synth motif and disembodied vocals do come in they color the landscape judiciously providing brilliant flashes that work in contrast to the heavy undertow efitting a track named after a bustling university area and transportation hub favors both sophistication and motion resulting in music thats soothing without sacrificing physicality uk producer submerse flips things with his remix playing up the tracks airiness and ethereality before locking into a high energy house flex paradoxically the track feels somehow more serene in its high-end focus yet far more frantic in the way it chops up those elements and subsumes them to a pulsing groove reconfigured for sunrise sets this is unleashed free to power forward and blast its once carefully managed elements into maximal arrangements without altering the songs core dn functioning as a muscular update rather than a total reinterpretation the result is a mix that emphasizes the tracks latent forlorn euphoria
grew up halfway between chicago and detroit and its had the expected effect on his music although what ive heard has tended to lean more towards the east this and 15 years of experience result in being a confident collection of rolling tech; lessons in drive from the 90s with a futuristic heads-down texture for the 10s part 2 of the eponymous track has the most edge fter kicking the door in with rock-solid swing and pulsating swipes of industrial doom ultra-swung hats swagger piercingly in it all bounces around in a coal-black berghain-friendly miasma of echo delay and white noise part 1 is the straighter version exchanging charging whiplash for metronomic precision while takes headfuck techno down a wormhole it could lazily be described as a throwback what with its dizzying millsian line and 909 drums the difference is that it doesnt try to be old or new or anything at all it just is

if youll allow me a bit of whimsy im 99 certain that the riff on deepgroove jamie ndersons is the name sergey ubka transformed into a synthesizer melody ok this trio probably arent secret fans of the russian pole vaulter but at least now you know its four notes right nd those four notes are what drives this track to epic status serving as an anchor for all manner of techno shenanigans to occur in and around it on one side you have your dad showing you the old making-the-wine-glass-sing trick to increasingly distracting effect; on the other side you have a pummeling kick drum and ants skittering across microphones its simultaneously unrelentingly simple and ridiculously complex exactly what you want from minimal techno in deepgroove jamie ndersons evolving soundscape gets colder on the -side with en klock unleashing his teutonic might on pitched at right around 130 pm and with an errant snare lodged in its 4/4 framework it lends itself nicely towards moving your way into the world of dubstep functional aims aside though klocks remix is just as dirty sounding as anything on his recent full-length with vinyl crackle and hovering ghostly strings ever-present elements more crucially though the beat sounds urgent driving towards something unfathomably dark and interesting which helps to propel it from the merely good to the great excellent stuff
across twelve releases has steadily gained a reputation for unearthing avant-garde talent with a roster that includes acteurs love cult and ivvvo s self-titled debut is the sound of deconstruction its songs hinting at pop only to take delight in crumbling from within countless timbres and textures jostle within her tracks either crammed together in a sonic maelstrom or separated by what feel like blasts of chilled air take the yawning spaces of pierced with grinds and blips that sound like theyve been coaxed from an ancient computer or the expanse of across which dry gun shots ring and are joined by gatelys silken vocals as she abstracts her voice into unrecognisable peaks and troughs and the digital noise becomes an increasingly thick blanket you begin to lose sight of the line dividing gately from her racket she lays her vocal on the butchers block on hacking and looping it into wordless and worded chunks like glossolalia it takes on the polymorphous qualities of a foreign language with traces of your own tongue just about discernible could be julianna barwick remixed by demdike stare the introduction teasing at folk-pop before descending into a mulch of disorientation and decay an obvious parallel is holly herndon but where her work is more refined and restrained and borrows more heavily from techno gatelys bleeds all over the place in keeping with her industrial influences they may nod to pop but her songs are less linear; instead they swill around with their own curious internal logic pointing to a preoccupation with sound itself
the american noise undergrounds forays into house and techno are well documented yet they arent the only beat-based genres it has explored in recent years the scenes myriad experiments in minimal wave and industrial have been just as fruitful a development thats largely thanks to dominick fernow (aka prurient and vatican shadow) and pieter schoolwerths wierd records groups that are part of this movement include profligate bad news daily life pure ground veiled clay rendering and out of those artists s evolution is the most dramatic the rhode island duo of maralie (vocals effects) and eli v manuscript (drum machine synthesizers) began seven years ago as a performance-art endeavor marrying gender-subverting theatrics to sonic brutalism: handcrafted costumes abuse of effects pedals pained shrieking etc but gradually (and rather unexpectedly) they sculpted themselves into the outfit heard on : ace practitioners of electro-punk and ebm with an understanding of pop songcraft that is unrivaled among their peers venus ejaculates has a classic doom-n-gloom vibe unfolding like a collection of american romantic or french surrealist short stories propelled by manuscripts strapping grooves maralie spins macabre yarns bloodied with themes of sexual repression ( ) sadomasochism ( ) and the flesh as existential slavery ( ) her powerful voice even at its most throat-shredding has always sounded formally trained but with maralie now harnessing her background in church singing the groups music possesses a newfound tension between the dark subject matter and her searing delivery yet none of these developments should imply that have abandoned noise music the myriad blasts of static littered throughout the record the way maralie filters her voice through scorching delay the boot-to-the-head belligerence of manuscripts beats each of these qualities reflects noises devotion to punishing dynamics instead of going the dreamy route and slathering everything in neo-gothic fuzz ( la sacred bones) opt for a varnish that is bold and clean spotlighting their love for big extravagant grooves and walloping bass this of course makes the most sense with the cuts that are the more dance-oriented like and the frantically galloping but its also an excellent fit for the slower more rock-based material such as and both tracks just like the rest of the album would sound larger than life blasted through a meyer sound system a shame then that 99 of the clubs on this planet would never touch something so strange and menacing

(aka cashmere or joris biesmans) is a self-confessed synthesiser addict is an acronym for virtual escape the name the belgian gave a modular synth he built out of a television set in 2012 he won a couple of awards for it and has been tinkering with hardware ever since he now lives in berlin and works as watergates sound engineer when he isnt djing as cashmere or performing live as hes in his studio feeding his addiction for his first release as an ep of kooky club fodder for his new eponymous label hes enlisted fellow hardware junkies legowelt and asok for remixes is the boldest track here its basically loungey tech house with a quirky intro but about halfway through biesmans fiddles with the dials: theres a guitar solo followed by a moment of noisy discourse as the track starts to collapse on itself it returns to normal in the closing quarter but leaves an odd aftertaste legowelts remix on the other hand is wholly satisfying its a skewered and slightly dissonant mix of floaty synth noodles and grungy bunker records-style acid discreetly and seductively non-conformist its is more palatable than the title track it sounds like biesmans glitchy machines chewing up tape and spitting it over a deep bass groove asok more or less reassembles the whole thing re-wiring it with a horde of his own chattering machines
for the latest mix invited recent visitor to australian shores who wowed the crowds with his combination of dj mixing live drumming and scratching (courtesy of davey dave) - uberzone - who alongside the likes of the crystal method is responsible for lighting a beacon for west coast us breakbeat and electronic music first off the mark is a cover track uberzone and afrika bambaataa do a breaks cover of manu dibangus soul makossa giving it a dancey electro feel using deep basslines electro stabs a melodic sax part and african tribal chants the last time these two teamed up was back in 1998 for the classic 2kool4skool and to hear this new effort is a treat elite force another recent visitor to australian shores turns on the tech-funk for driving me crazy - a more soulful affair featuring a repetitive male vocal sample and melodic bass line before getting right into general midis (yet another recent visitor to our shores ) bassline killer remix of aquasky vs masterblasters seville uberzone teams up once again with tcr boss rennie pilgrem for fuego a track filled with hard hitting synth stabs and electro arpeggios the final uberzone tune on this release is the beat oriented drunken monkey combining old skool/hardcore style beats with tribal percussion and digital scratching turn me out by christian j and matie has become a breaks anthem lately bringing the kathy brown classic back to life rolling bass lines punchy drum beats and that vocal sample - turn me on turn me out make me scream make me shout - sing-a-long breaks galore koma bones take me back squeezes in afterwards featuring the vocals of robert owens and appears in a bass fueled remix done by blim before general midi returns once again with his bass rokkaz taking the bass to even darker levels another one of tasmanias finest exports andy page contributes mr rush pulling out the quirky electro samples bouncy drum patterns and dark basslines before the mix closes off with ferocious mullets cakewhole providing a deeper and more laidback mood to close the cd this release is actually quite unusual - a us dj/producer takes and mixes a collection of tunes mainly from uk artists who play and produce a sound that has its origins from the us west coast to be released internationally from a uk based label oooookaaaaayyyy it features great tunes however i just didnt find this mix to be as fun to listen to as freq nastys - which spawned off an anthemic bootleg mix and got massive crowds rapping along to it still uberzones keeps to focus of showcasing the latest breaks and giving breaks fans a taste of the chosen selectahs record box
founders iueke and zaltan are both in the rare vinyl trade so its no surprise that the collectors sensibility permeates their label iuekes tapes in which his neglected 90s recordings are dusted off and pressed to vinyl make for a kind of personal crate-digging; new releases like st phane laportes kitschy fourrure sounds and nico mottes italo-vangelis trip rheologia have done their best to sound like long-lost gems but is the labels first bona fide vintage find its five tracks were made in the mid-80s by two italian musicians paki zennaro and gianni visnadi they were never distributed beyond a handful of demo cassettes that is until one of these tapes was discovered by iuekes partner in a paris market made with a minimal setup of synths drum machines and guitar was meant as a practice aid for contemporary dance schools its not just the title that hints at this intent: the albums poised minimalist compositions neutral in mood seem designed to be unobtrusive and adaptable sometimes this is to their detriment has a quiet jittery energy but doesnt quite take it anywhere the scant glimmers of drum machine and synth in are weighed down by the surrounding silence these moments the albums intended function seems to be holding its creators back elsewhere though the constraint becomes a boon the 15-minute opener is the records crowning achievement and a solid introduction to the duos sound the percussion patters gently around a beat rather than staidly marking one out and the pastel-hued synths and guitars are woven into soft harmonious chord-tapestries its an extremely unimposing world but over time you find yourself sucked in when the tracks bassline hook returns after a languorous central breakdown its a gentle revelation paki and visnadi dont quite reach these heights elsewhere though they come close the drums are reduced to a barely-there shaker pulse allowing those crystalline synths to swell richly the guitar patterns in meanwhile crest and fall with soothing regularity even if the drums piercing their liquid surface are just a touch too sharp for comfort is a charming record on its own terms s with any crate-digger find the improbable facts of its discovery make it all the better
what is techno is not a matter of opinion its a matter of difference - and repetition from the foundations of the music to where it finds its most sublime expression that s the principal at work and people who say it all sounds the same well it s just because they can t hear the difference is someone who can his music takes the stale formulas of the old beast and makes them playful and young again if it s techno by numbers then they re magic numbers mostly his tracks often play with the phasing of the loops to the point where the elements of the music are socialising with each other: breaking up then re-coupling in new combinations it s minimal too but in the proper sense of the word working with as little as possible to make something work as well as it can nd work it does: on collage under pushes his style further on three tasty techno workouts that bristle with strumming rhythms phasing through each other in party mode is the big-room business utilising long build-ups tear outs and breakdowns to drive the groove through the loop and right into the floor it s a nice piece of classic techno with a touch of the reinhart voigt of old - guaranteed to frighten pets and the elderly follows suit bringing the noise through a spooky loop haunting its way towards a sombre padfest where it reflects for a moment how far past its bedtime it is before returning to the business of burning the floor is the quirkiest of the numbers here playing with out of phase rhythms an almost studio eins-ish bassfloor and a melody that sounds for all the world like what skeletons dance to if and when they do it s the most playful and interesting of the three and is the closest under comes to finding his own difference among the repetitions ll in all a decent ep full of floor-filling functional techno with that little something extra and that s more than enough

s plaintive indie-electro proves to be fertile ground for the subtle remixing skills of robag wruhme having been handed the task by dj koze of sending the acoustic two-step of nalog towards the dance floor wruhme attacks it from two angles the habaz remix is campfire house wruhme keeps the stoned guitar phrasing of the original but augments it with lazy handclaps blasts of harmonica glockenspiel and treacly bass its a relaxed mid-afternoon at a festival kind of tune the remix (available only on vinyl until later in the year) strips everything back hacking even further into the original and discarding the excess subtle dabs of vocal are stretched to breaking point on a chugging dub backing punctuated by idiosyncratic squeaks fizzes wooshes and yelps
remember when electro-house didnt use to be such a dirty term for people looking for interesting electronic music time before buzzsaw synths and rock dynamics took over from the emphasis on groove and sound invention erik wiegand k errorsmith and erghain resident fiedel certainly do together they were responsible for 1997s donna which became one of the seminal tracks that took pride of place in the countless boxes of house techno and electro jocks in the years following wiegand and fiedel havent exactly been the most prolific pair since making their return in 08 with two chirpy electro cuts on s 10th nniversary ep but it seems that theyve been holding back their more banging material for this particular 12-inch oth and lets appeared in demo form on oys noizes i love techno mix from two years ago and while its true that neither of them sound particularly fresh youd be a fool to deny their capability to get a dance floor reaching for the lasers is the most ravey of the two using a pattern of pitch-shifted repeated notes and squealing feedback in order to achieve its maximal mission but its just edged by the flip sides rumbling bass riff and slippery synth work which is again characterised by the duos relentless pitch alterations if you find much of the modern techno released today to be a bit serious for your liking and are looking for something both fun and impeccably produced to spice up your set you wont go far wrong with this release
launched in february 2013 utch imprint s four part lost archives series has so far made good on its intention: to unearth buried gems tracks like claude young and takasi nakajimas think twice makams lion king and jonas kopps telergia are proof of this more than 12 months on from the penultimate ep the final two tracker features an old alias of rotterdams benny rodrigues and label heads like its predecessors lost archives iv is another rock solid outing cosmic opener was lifted from an album rodrigues made several years ago with no intention of it ever seeing the light of day (an email exchange with errick may made him change his mind) as heavenly pads glide over a jostling drum break its easy to see why may was a fan you can imagine him liking the b side too is the kind of sleek soulful techno that has become synonymous with strapping echoed stabs unruly snares and comet like flares to a surging beat and sign off in a beatless emotional swirl of pads a fittingly moving end to a memorable series
et tu matias thats how felt when led off aguayos new dont ep as roughly speaking the 2 392nd house track of the year so far to deliberately evoke chicago in 1987 but that initial discouragement gave way pretty fast: this is one of the more durable of the new-jackin lot with it up-front tireless keyboard bassline and tinny pads that sound the way smoke with lasers going through them look f youre going to announce yourself after a long absence adjusting to fashion but getting the accessories right is a decent way to begin aguayo is so into his old drum machines here that he devotes two-thirds of the ep to them and them alone pretty much ni os takes off from liasons dangereuses 1981 classic los ni os del parque which is fun for comparisons sake but less so for lay listening the digital bonuses and are percussion-only exercises included for djs but while comeme a latin-accented track aguayo often sings atop live fits the same basic bill as the others its bounding 808 and electro-cowbell percussion has a lot of give its paced like a song dynamic as well as propulsive the eps clear highlight is the title cut ts simple a light-vocaled call-and-response refrain needling synth lines tromping rhythm but when all the elements are there simple is all you need

this is the brand spanking new release from jukebox in the sky who have recently deviated from the traditional slacker forays in the underground that has established itself as one of the freshest and wholesome labels on the block opening its doors to various artists the first of which was russias natalia data and the twisted vip now for their benchmark tenth outing simon rogers aka has gotten the call from jukebox hq and the answer theyve received is first up is the original mix which kicks off with smooth organically tweaked mix of guitar sounds underneath live sounding bassline and percussive elements setting the stage for what follows as proceedings burst into an even lusher groove as subtle 2/4 beats are added while stabby synths begin to take control of the situation with the aid of a warbling and constantly shifting bassline momentarily the energy strips back as a beautiful instrumental oozes into play peaking with the addition of a hands in the air pads unravelling down to its end the re-takes come in two chunky shapes the first of which is a paolo mojo remix he quickly whips up a funk injected rehash smoothening out the house appeal with the addition of stabs and scintillating synth sounds that create a voluptuous atmosphere slacker takes up the rear utilising the originals parts and mellowing out the atmospherics yet still retaining the originals big room appeal of its bassline altogether its neat and tight with all the right elements in place to get the dancefloor shuffling nice jukebox in the sky never disappoint and this release certainly exceeds expectations if thats not enough for you theres another exclusive paolo mojo mix for digital addicts so dont miss out on that either
for a few moments early on in you wonder if this even a techno mix 20 minutes later you wonder if theres been a more techno mix cd released in the past few years the berghain resident behind 06 usually plays either the warm up or the closing set at the famed berlin club and his entry into their mix series sounds like it: gearing up slowly it eventually hits a breakneck 134 bpm before gliding to a close nodge is an old school german techno head a few years after the berlin wall fell he was organizing parties eager to share all of the new music he was hearing over the tracklist to 06 you can see some of the names that nodge was probably playing back then planetary mix even explicitly points toward the mid to late 90s as nodges favorite era for techno: s s and s all date from the period before nodge kicks things into high gear though he sets the mood with slow burning tracks from and a redshape remix of gr sers is when things finally switch on properly and nodge lets it run for five minutes acclimating listeners to whats about to come once the table is set nodge nudges the bpm and overall intensity a little higher with each new track sound throughout this middle section is purist but fun a slight twist on the widely held belief that berghain techno is dreary cavernous or monochrome s starts out on the warpath but it then opens up to reveal an almost trance y melody counter melody that rubs against the beat of crtls could almost be described as giddy if it didnt hit so hard with landmark berghain mixes from marcel dettmann and ben klock behind them now finds itself depending on some of its lesser known talents to showcase the sound of the club marcel fenglers berghain 0 proved that things werent quite as straight ahead as you might have assumed nodges effort provides further evidence that the club and label is part of a techno continuum reminding us that tracks more than a decade old can sound just as fresh as those produced last week thats why will sound as timeless in ten years as it does now

sasha and alan fitzpatrick might be a headline-grabbing partnership but does it work both artists approach big-room techno and tech house from contrasting perspectives: sashas music is soppy and dreamy where fitzpatricks is brawny and straightforward on their first release together they negotiate a smart middle ground presenting two stomping cuts that stir the emotions without going overboard features two versions of the title track version 1 noisier and more epic has sashas fingerprints all over it with a wrist-snapping groove charging beneath a blanket of synths that swells and recedes like the tide the 60-second breakdown complete with choral wails should ruffle arena-sized floors version 2 with its giant rave stabs distant cries and nifty percussion carries several hallmarks of fitzpatricks clean and boisterous style though the real praise should go to whoever composed the gleaming melody that bursts into life around the midway mark its the best thing about the ep
records are a little like wandering through a strange city where detours are encouraged and in every side street something unexpected but wonderful lurks whether its john coltrane sax solos or pizzicato cellos s they proved on the meandering quarter-hour epic sly gazabo and their spellbinding r podcast the new york trio are at their most effective when working with large canvases which is perhaps why their latest record feels slightly underwhelming s saxophones billow like curtains in a breeze but the greek-island-at-sunset mood jars with stuttering woodblock and snares s live instruments usually complement and riff off dance sounds but here the pad-aping sax stabs and cello arpeggios mimic traditional house elements rather than adding anything is better with rugged subs anchoring a dawn chorus of honking sax and strings that are delayed softly until they flutter like birds theffts remix clips the tracks wings it applies a wonky filter to the trills and squeals and shifts the focus to the low-end as it bounces between crunchy toms
if 2008 was the year of vakant for looks to be the year of as she did for vakant the dj/producer is set to release a 12-inch and full-length showcasing the work that shes gotten up to since we heard her last as might be expected her sound hasnt changed much one gets the sense that her switch over to was simply down to vakant wanting to focus their attention on mathias kadens full-length has the same sort of open-ending minimal sound that typified may be later its full of enough stops starts and sonic messiness to get lost in for days while firmly maintaining its forward momentum via a heavy bassline and slow and steady kick drum this momentum is key because after its followed up by the inconsequential two-minute sound experiment and plough the same ground but fail to deliver in the same way as despite feeling just as unbridled in their execution and sound design you got the sense that in that you were moving toward a logical conclusion with and its closer to an uncomfortable stasis where the rhythm is laid out and then strange sounds are plopped into the mix with little rhyme or reason instead of leading us into a forest of strange and wondrous sounds and then gently guiding us out the other side leaves us stranded without a map to find our way out and ends up with a resolutely average pair of tracks as a result

its not hard to tell that aka belgian producer david nizet has been knocking around for a while indeed takes its influence as much from the punishing techno nizet was making as part of 6th sense approach during the mid-90s as it does from dub or detroit variants it offers surprises at every turn the title track is based on the kind of tooth-rattling post-hardcore bassline that typified most of the catalogue on reload the label that 6th sense approach used to release on but rather than pummeling the listener into submission nizet frames the bass amid an off-beat rhythm spiky percussion and light airy chords a similar approach prevails on with a menacing low end forming the backdrop for another rolling rhythm that doesnt kick in all the obvious places this idiosyncratic approach doesnt mean that nizet isnt adept at creating streamlined dance floor techno: the repetitive chord-heavy groove of is on a par with the hypnotic repetition of dehnert lindau and skudge while s choice of remixer also enhances the eps dj appeal fellow belgian peter s remix catalogue is becoming as impressive as his original productions and his take on the title track is no exception straightforward yet devastatingly effective a snarling industrial bass underpins a locked-on groove that filters and rolls in all the right places
early albums are a hugely enjoyable balance between madness and fun for the first three volumes of the series pulled together selections that neither took themselves too seriously nor minded if something came from yesterday or yesteryear you got acid house going into james brown your next to the erotic drum band and ray ng sharing a vinyl with war t was weird and wonderful change began with eskimo 4 when they began to mix the albums and shift more towards a confused disco/disco noir sound although eskimo 5 starts off with belters like s which flows beautifully thanks to re-edited percussion into the fantastically overblown to the by the change in their sound broadly continues and is even accentuated album suffers for it eskimo 5 just isnt as enjoyable as their previous compilations whilst the first few cuts are decent muscular talo/odd disco the back nine of the tracks here are forgettable for a pair who normally have such cracking taste its somewhat alarming to hear (and say) that the album is overall average t seems that instead of following their own path the duo are having a bash at the trendy cosmic sound which they dont quite get right perhaps most disappointing is that the crazy tracks once a highlight arent bonkers in an endearing way: theyre just stupid by sounds like a tvian eurovision entry from the 70s and in by is a baffling woeful finale bearing in mind this is the twentieth commercial mix they can be forgiven if occasionally their mixes aren t top drawer but after a disappointing effort for the fabric series perhaps its time they looked back to the spirit of june 2000 when they put together the first eskimo comp t was a riot back then you know
s new album is much like the previous two under his own name 000s laconic and 00 s inward ctrl is more rooted in the mid- 0s electronica of the black dog and global communication than it is in the more dance floor-orientated techno of his collaborations with lopazz or his solo -inches like optumismo and the thom yorke-championed huyendo part cortex hasnt completely repressed his techno tendencies here with the first four tracks all anchored around undulating basslines and tensile beats with the occasional rush of insistent hi-hats but those rhythms are largely submerged beneath vaporous guitar the squeals of malfunctioning radio transmissions and deep and frosty detroit chords and as progresses so cortex seems more confident to roam further from the dance floor track five weaves operatic samples and febrile synths around a gently oscillating rhythm the rumbles of track seven are only dance floor material for people who like raving to earthquakes and the wonderfully emotive closing number has a lambent synth sweep warmly cocooning the listener against what sounds like rain against the window like its creator is a thoughtful and reflective album at odds with the prevailing climate in todays techno indeed given that he talked of retiring last year we may never have heard it at all and you can maybe detect a certain sense of lassitude in the albums moodier and more melancholy moments so be thankful that cortex has managed to transform bitterness into something sweeter and that his belief in letting the music speak for itself means we shouldnt have believed a word he said about hanging up for good

stick on the first of the five on s debut for plus 8 and you might start thinking this release would be better suited to the label s slimmer younger brother yet the spaniard cant hide his true colours he may have taken his foot off the gas a bit in recent times but there is most definitely a point to everything here: all five sleek intense similar-but-different slammers feature some sort of floor-friendly pay-off so might not make the most auspicious of starts it all sounds a bit um minimal but stick with it osuna slowly build layers over precise drums before the flanged fx and wonky siren break free for two brief rampages a taste of things to come yup will step up your interest: a warped warping bassline slowly creeps in before an unexpected hit: clunking clipped relief-style hats add some swing as reverbed bleeps and burps build then the money shot: a mini-a walking contradiction-style meltdown before that bassline is assaulted and gets dragged kicking and screaming off to infinity joakhim is leaner and busier the bumbling sub scatter-shot fx work and clever programming - including two drops: one tight one downright explosive mark this one out as the black sheep we get a breather on seschamps: there s a whiff of chicago to the restrained drums and rat-a-tat hats before a stabbed bleepoid riff and looped sub show their true colours the digital-only track - which cropped up on marco carolas recent fabric mix drops another gear: rubbery acid bass dry snares served with varying degrees of reverb and sakho-style drones do their thing until it all kicks off for a brief frantic flash phew five tracks one common purpose
s brand of house and techno is stark yet glows with emotion is his first release since the 2015 album grind like that record it looks towards his home on the american eastern seaboard inspired by the regions harsh winters is brittle and made for biting air and dark nights it takes the most memorable aspects of grind and isolates them making for a more direct release could become one of s best-known tracks like the best artists on dial richard gleans something compelling from simple sounds in this case an ominous chord the tension stays high for all ten minutes while melancholic melodies and a crestfallen bassline orbit the centre richard plays with multiple clashing melodies on a sleight of hand that showcases his sharp sense of musicality and steps away from the dance floor entirely for the bleak which is just a chord progression flickering over a somber bassline silence speaks volumes on and the rest of an ep that sees find his voice by using it sparingly
next up from the wallop stable is an incredibly tasty electro-tech three tracker from bristol based crew doug ross nick hill entitled the both artists have notched up a respectable bunch of credentials having worked with labels such as emi defunked react and advanced recordings to name just a handful identity is the first track starting off with a bunch of clicky percussion along with tight stabs enforcing a direction as more elements begin to hit off each other gathering momentum with the addition of vocal cuts played around with for maximum effect events strip back as in sweeps a big dirty synthline pulsating around the ricocheting drum patterns enhancing the big room vibe desert storm starts off in the same mould as before with clipping percs creating the rhythm but not for long as a filthy phat ass bassline rears its head spluttering and squelching as momentary fills break up the hypnotic flow vocals are played about with as the glitching elements work about a whole range of enticing angry cuts ouch this track bites closing the door on this release is cordoba focus progging things up with an electro flavoured groove catchy basslines and vocoded female vocals create an air of suspense as tight hat rhythms keep the energy at maximum mid way a beckoning melody has surfaced just adding that extra lift needed to make us smile the production on this ep is crisp clean and darn tight with each track holding its own a definite bullseye hit from wallop
is a resident at zukunft a z rich club with wide spaces low ceilings and a stylish interior if s mistress debut represents how he plays there zukunfts dance floor needs lots of variety has supple warm-up tracks a vocal number and in a bleepy robert armani-style banger ( a digital-only track seems like something youd use to darken the mood ) an accomplished collage of house and techno styles s charm is nested in small decisions and particular sounds the off-key off-beat chord on is one the gravelly string loop on is another s vocal arrangement daisy-chained shards of fluttering mezzo-soprano vowels is s moody showstopper but again its the small things that set it apart bristly vinyl crackles coat with tactile texture while a rhythmic accent as thin and sharp as a hacksaw slices back and forth excels during these subtle aggressions though also handles s tender components with care threaded with glassy tones and smouldering pads is a deep house roller with a gossamer lining on fashions a demure anthem in the vein of midlands before we leave much of shows a gift for zesty contrasts but the acid basslines mild agitation seems slightly out of place even on a record where details carry so much weight its a forgivable blip on an otherwise promising debut

is without hesitation recognizable as me but you neednt know a thing about who or what kristian eyer and frank wiedemann do or have done for it to make sense its not that either one marches out a hook or fixes on a particular melodic element to take their place in the room in which they play me is exploring a particular tonal range here a sparkling mid-range typified by the churchy organ that puts dots all over both sides of this release especially the its evoked by everything else though s dense swirls of hi-hats and pinwheel percussion and glow-in-the-dark electric-keyboard lines (as opposed to synthesizers though obviously those are in there too) and on dusty vocal drops a hissing quasi-hi-hat and pinpoint foghorn-ish string pads takes a minute or two to fully wind down but the middle section is full of the kind of tone bursts and clusters that could have come from the grandfather paradox the essential 2009 mix of experimental electronic music that me along with henrik schwarz and dixon selected and mixed comes to a full stop essentially ending where it began somewhere rather gorgeous
with two heralded eps for lobster theremin under his belt berlin-based englishman jay donaldson moves to amsterdams label feels like a natural follow-up to the equation and forever eps with donaldson further developing his knack for hazy chicago/detroit-referencing house jams is the most pads-driven offering of a trio that all lean heavily on shimmering ambience rather than just lending background atmosphere they form the core of alongside celestial melodies that spiral outwards deploys fluttering arps and snappier drums for a swifter more bass-heavy excursion but its wispy keys and pads are strong reminders of who were dealing with here closer has some distinct elements chiefly its auntie flo-style tropical percussion and a croaking vocal refrain but it still fits neatly into both this ep and donaldsons increasingly strong catalogue

olf van elden has all the qualities of a breakthrough artist hes paid his dues digging and working at record shops in his hometown of amsterdam he was a resident dj at the legendary club trouw and hes taken his time with releases putting out a handful of tracks between s 2013 debut and a self-titled ep in 2015 was van eldens first banner year with his varied electric park square ep on rush hour and then a dark electro-influenced stunner for apparently van elden was inspired to write after hearing a dj stingray set which makes sense: its a study in sci-fi-tinged electro complete with writhing drexciyan synth leads that sputter like a motor in choppy waters its heavy but not macho rubbed raw like van eldens past work (hes always had a penchant for grubby drum sounds and they sound good here ) where sits somewhere in the realm of hero worship convextions remix takes it directly into electros higher echelons he weaves its wireframe structure into a gliding journey up there with the best of his work as e r p van eldens other dance floor track is more humble the introvert to the title tracks extrovert its still got the electro skeleton but this one is all murmurs and soft bleeps something low-key for the beginning of a set ends with a beatless three-minute track that feels like a trifle but is actually home to some of the records most fulsome synth sounds and effects bears the mark of a producer worth keeping an eye on
is steven warwick a berlin-based presence on the cassette and cdr underground since 2006 as with many of his contemporaries the last couple of years have seen warwicks music drift in dancier climes foregrounding percussion and drawing on the sonic signifiers of established dance music forms its a kind of outsider infatuation with dance floor dynamics thats fast congealing in a scene centred around labels like 100 silk but thats also entering in increasingly prolonged flirtations with more established dance institutions (as evidenced by warwicks forthcoming release on rush hour) producer returns the label for the d viation ep a record that perfectly reflects the artists name: like the woozy stickiness of a day on a roof terrace in full glare of the sun this music is in some sense luxurious but in another faintly rturous unnatural and above all sluggish for the first half at least opener d viation builds slowly in a midi guitar groove that you cant help but smirk at while c tait un trades on a slack disco-ish shuffle all the parts sound hand-played: shakers drift in and out of time; chords fall slightly early or late; at points the whole thing threatens come apart at the seams before being pulled back in shape result is appealingly loose and grainy giving off a similar bedroom-auteur vibe early chicago house and are both built around a more rambunctious syncopation former forges determinedly on as a dense thicket of synths do weird things in the background before dropping out reveal a loop of vocals and plaintive woodwind seemingly smuggled in from a tally different emotional space latter is almost straight-up party music like a ramshackle carnival built on cheap hardware but theres still something unsettling lurking just under the surface
martin clark has long been mythologizing londons urban landscape through the hardcore continuum and more recently creating it with his own keysound label theres hardly been a better match for clarks keen mix of the theoretical with the throbbing than london collective snatched up by clark for keysound in 009 and since releasing three eps the seven strong collective (reduced to four names on their keysound releases) have a heavily hybridized sound with one foot in dmz dubstep foundations and the other with a toe in every nuum wading pool you could think of littered with speech snippets film clips and all sorts of ethnic artifacts they make for a london centric dance friendly analogue to demdike stare their debut full length effort is a hefty two disc affair buzzing and humming like a foreign bazaar while the group seem largely autonomous in the grand scheme of things the sound they exhibit on owes (or shares) a lot to the sinogrime or sinodub tradition the act of incorporating east asian samples into uk dance music practiced by kode9 wiley and digital mystikz among others apparent from song titles like and the group find as much inspiration getting lost in imagined third world urban sprawls as that of their home city musically manifesting londons considerable african and south asian diaspora in a way that dubstep has largely ignored s debt to dubstep is primarily a lineal one rather than a literal one long seven minute hymns that cycle and repeat with little variation the percussive patterns are more complex and intricate than most dubstep hinting at jungle and late 90s/early 00s darkside drum bass that latter and oft ignored period proves dynamite in their hands creating drum patterns that feel invigoratingly familiar yet are even more excitingly foreign and alien a track like s with its quick brass knuckle jabs in the dark seems to fold in so many narratives at once jungle agility neurofunk precision ambient d b melodic bliss that the effect it has is just as dizzying as the wildly unpredictable rhythms themselves elsewhere they combine the exoticism of asian hand percussion with those same urban jungle tropes exemplified best on s possibly the highlight of the entire 6 track affair blending together screaming divas gunshot snares taken right out of the eski playbook and rolling percussion that seems to mischievously slip out of one bar and into the next one its all interrupted by one of those pseudo scientific monologues that used to define the most paranoid of weed saturated classic dubstep indeed have no shame in retreading the past and its odd to see so much palpable excitement and dialogue surrounding what is in some ways a throwback dubstep album in but is so impressive and immersive a statement that it deigns to create its own alternate universe: imagine if drum bass forked off on an entirely different path than uk garage and eventually dubstep the group flippantly lifts endless canon samples in their music no doubt youll recognize the higher screech in from countless hardcore and drum bass tracks or loleatta holloways ubiquitous you got me burnin up in the hellish descent of in the hands of other producers these samples would seem like hopelessly confused and shameless appropriations of raver nostalgia but here it just feels like theyre recontextualizing them into their own world its hard to imagine anyone without an ascetic sort of patience sitting through all 50 minutes of snaking rhythms and tribal paeans but thats just the kind of thing a group like would expect from listeners in their frightening and fascinating alternate universe in some ways its arguably dubsteps first concept album an expansive and visionary what if a dreamscape of a post globalization collapsed multicultural society where cultures collide uncontrollably
is the rather dramatic collaboration by synkro and bering strait they feel their emotions deeply and they really want you to feel them too their debut last year indulged synkros tendencies to over-emote but it was also an unexpected display of lucidity when it easily could have just been a waft of cheap perfume they return for a go on samurais vinyl-only sub-label with refreshing brevity and precision here the duo tackle cheesy elements head-on as if taking on a challenge im not quite sure how they did it but even my cynical mind is moved during the untitled third track as what sound like pan flutes flicker dimly in the distance the second track sounds like a transplant from the autonomic days with its sighing synths and detroit chords but they gussy up that template with poignant string plucks and whispered vocal exhortations the ep is bookended by two stately interludes: the first features searing guitar leads a la david gilmour and the latter pings icy piano chords off of a dissolving drum pattern isnt for everyone but when it hits the right chords man theyre gorgeous
youd be hard pressed to discern much difference between albert van abbes previous label no comment and his new imprint vanabbe there are the same track names that look like catalogue numbers theres the same pairing of minimalist rhythm-led techno with a single ambient track here astroturf where warped strings fizz around what sound likes the breaths of some small animal whats missing is anyone else no remixes no other originals just unadulterated albert van abbe which for fans of dutch techno at its most functional and uncompromising is no bad thing theres little here you could call melody both and let hi-hats and rim shots do most of the work the synths serving as texture for the percussion to rattle against but each time it seems the loops are too incessant theres a flash of pad a switch in cymbal pattern and youre encouraged to push on over the next horizon is more immediately engaging with its rippling two-note bass and answer code request-style stabs this is as close as van abbe gets to an earworm its the eps most successful moment because where the other tracks evoke dank but unchanging atmospheres here theres also tension like function abbe shows how the smallest hint of filter or a snare roll can tighten every muscle on a dance floor
whatever is happening with the oddly dormant ongaku/playhouse/klang triumvirate of labels roman fl gel seems have hit an active patch with his own productions in the last six months weve been treated remixes for mo rcitysoul and others the duran duran-sampling single brian le bon and the live at robert johnson mix where he debuted it and a back- -roots ep for running back now recording for the first time on hamburgs dial a label whose whole m o is deeply indebted the kind of chicago revivalism-with-a-twist that fl gel has been doing since the mid 90s he turns up with a damn-near perfect track it succeeds in part because it knows exactly what it wants be this isnt a track for every moment or mood; its a careful exercise in crisp percussion minor-key piano chords and twinkling synthesizers chilly as a display of christmas lights glimpsed through a frosted taxi window as you leave your lover for the last time but no really its hardly as indulgent as all that and thats precisely why its a triumph: its emo but restrained thanks an immaculate arrangement that pits a fistful of nal elements in pinwheeling countermotion a quiet riot of rising falling lines as for the rest of the ep the three tracks are all quirkily worthy affairs that could surely find their place in one set or another and just as importantly offer a window in fl gels unique musical imagination is a sour squeaky minimalist techno jam that sounds like a dainty take on oni ayhun; is a brooding beatless miniature with a similar feel nicolas jaars downtempo sketches but more fully realized closes out the record with a steppy bit-crushed house jam in the vein of fl gels coolly nerve-wracked soylent green album la forza del destino ; beginning with a clipped static-brushed groove all dissonant chimes and nervous bass it gives way a rhodes keyboard solo that blows the scale of the thing sky-high

the way s debut lp movement re-formed the voice into whirling clouds of data seemed to be a comment on our increasingly cybernetic social-networked existence its a theme she makes more explicit in the albums follow-up for herndon sampled her daily browsing experience using a software patch that recorded snippets of audio coming from her web browser and throw them together the result is an anarchic jumble of sounds pristine chords garbled scraps of percussion and of course lots of voices re-pitched and layered to form the titular ensemble its jump-cut logic and fleeting moments of static gorgeousness bring to mind oneohtrix point nevers recent r plus seven ut rather than presenting these sounds as abstract delights herndon wrings a song from them a jumpy electro pop number thats propelled by its dense arrangement s a conceptual exercise its as striking as anything on movement ; as a piece of music its quite a bit better in contrast to the meticulously crafted -side was apparently recorded in one take dont be fooled by the title though: as usual herndon fractures her vocal into raindrop-like fragments themselves sculpted to form gorgeous dappled chord-shapes its reminiscent of movement s more linear moments reathe say but again its much more pleasing on the ear
its always an event when decides to pluck another couple of tracks from his vast pool of unreleased dubs and commit them to wax this time around though it feels particularly significant and not only because recent releases have leaned overwhelmingly towards coki the release of in cuba earlier this year felt like the beginning of a new era for the dubstep pioneer marking if not a radical shift in style then at least a ramping up of ambition could be read as an olive branch to diehard fans; a reassurance that s values remain unchanged of course there are no real surprises here: both of these tracks have been floating around for some years and even if they hadnt been where is concerned quality is guaranteed is more of a traditional half-stepper all whipcrack snares plodding sub and twitchy angular hi-hats the desolate pads occasionally smeared with little molten trails of delay evoke the twilit urban landscapes that have been grist to the dubstep mill from day dot this is far from a dated clich though: s exhaustive attention to detail keeps things fresh meanwhile is more striking a dense percussive workout built around a galloping sub line the drop when it comes (courtesy of peter snow) plays on dubsteps half-time/double-time dichotomy expertly kick and snare thwacking out a measured half-time beat over a compact mosaic of sub and bongo syncopations
its been said that in techno heroes never die turns out its no different for legendary group ei r whove been kicking around various sectors of drum bass since mid-90s flirting with mainstream success before becoming jack-of-all-trades hardliners in past five or so years since ir split with good looking almost a decade ago blus newfound freedom has often led to sprawl like 2009s excellent but overlong natural history and me continues with which contains some of ir most spirited and invigorated material yet you just have patience to look for it: is eighteen songs wide and over 90 minutes so chances are you wont be sitting through whole thing while albums sequencing is well-executed moving from peak to valley back to peak with ease its a marathon listen and youll have as much luck jumping from track to track at random brimming with veteran confidence group jumps styles at a clip much more restless than single-minded natural history s most exciting moments come when y interpret shlocky midrange thrills of modern mainstream drum bass downtempo title track is smeared with hollywood widescreen soft focus all m83-esque watery guitars and gated drums while angelic vocals courtesy of feels like aural approximation of gently sliding across ice just slippery enough without feeling dangerous n res a track like five which mixes summery classic rock crunch with a crisp quantized crack of a beat: its an intoxicating upper which really drives home how much fun se guys can be while barely even trying i cant possibly cover all bases that do without making this review as unnecessarily long as album but res bound to be a little nugget of something for everyone yve got minimal minutiae covered with collab hard-edged neurofunk with and pop-dnb with any number of excellent vocal spots ( ) albums only weak moments come when groups style-hopping lands m in particularly gimmicky territory awkward jungle pastiche on or saccharine fairydust on high hopes but a few duds out of eighteen is still a pretty hard ratio to complain about more than anything else is a reassertion of value relevance and importance that a dance outfit whove been around for almost twenty years can still make music that stands up to fiercest wave of newcomers if y had to make album eighteen tracks long just to show us that y really can do almost everything well so be it
king britts first appeared two years ago with a 2-inch for on which the philly producers heady analogue jams seemed intriguing but lacking crucial context like an extended trailer for a movie we never got to see now with he finally gives us that feature film with moments of stage setting tender introspection and some pretty great action scenes inspired heavily by britts love of sci-fi (the name comes from fifth element ) has all the starry-eyed wonder and hammy melodrama of a genre archetype and like so many sci-fi films it has its ups and downs balancing brilliant turns with more humdrum scenes transcendent launches the album into space early on its a beauty: a revving engine of a synth line and some propulsive drums take it up into the stratosphere letting it slip into a gorgeous free-floating breakdown where the synths twinkle like nearby stars from there has some trouble staying at those lofty heights though it always remains in orbit many of the other tunes feel like variations on the same idea going back to 20 2s (also included here) yre spiralling synth odysseys that sound like theyre blasting off towards nowhere in particular a wanderlust that can feel unpredictable or aimless depending on your mood britt wisely breaks up those longer tracks with shorter interludes mood pieces with little synth curlicues and garbled snatches of radio transmission res a kitschy sense of theatre in these sketches which britt almost drives into the ground with the help of a few guest singers his neighbour who he discovered by accident shows up on several songs from wordless cooing on the swaggering to full-on opera singing on latter is just as overwrought as it sounds on paper s wailing doesnt mesh with the albums john carpenter-inspired mood gives a fine performance on the albums attempt at pop but the track itself melts into a sticky mess of warmed-over synths ly finds a happy medium closing the album with the clumsy but evocative line why is the measure of love loss repeated over some especially ornate synth work from britt synthesizers are s best asset and they make the album more about ear candy than content is full of plush textures to pad all the chunky drums and sputtering analogue hiccups but whether or not it can keep your attention is another story and the album as a whole doesnt live up to its sci-fi conceit res something deliciously retro-futuristic about king britt making space-age music with old machines and it can be absolutely wonderful to listen to (check the nine-minute title track for a proper journey to the heavens and back) but if is that feature film we were waiting for it could stand an edit or two
few artists in the bass scene are as explicitly conceptual as each of her grime-infused releases is a vehicle to explore cultural understanding in the digital age from western fantasies of china to american police brutality but so far al qadiris concepts have tended to promise more than the music has delivered for her new ep she examines gender performativity in the arab gulf and achieves a far stronger marriage of idea and execution the title comes from a mispronunciation of the arabic word shaneea meaning outrageous the word also has currency in the underground kuwaiti queer scene which uses the label to describe being an evil queen thats al qadiri on the cover made up as her own badass queen alter-ego in an homage to hyper-feminised images of female arab pop stars the tracks are peppered with spoken-word vocals from kuwaiti collaborators who reference ballroom quips the lyrics drawn from drag comedies and quotes from grindr its a heady concept but al qadiri tackles the music with an original approach and a playful ear she subverts her trademark video game melodies into glistening approximations of arabic scales while tightly syncopated percussion draws from grime drum kits and the traditional battery of gulf drums the stark sirens and sinuous melodies of glide with the menace of a voguing queen the metallic rhythms of are particularly potent for club play while the smooth intonations of the vocalist turn the fizzing strut of into an easy standout it seems that al qadiri as at her boldest and most irreverent is also al qadiri at her best
the very brilliant are up to their old tricks again with this great release from scan 7 and scan x 2 tracks from both artists with both complimenting each other and both doing the famous label justice the smooth strings and effected vocals open up final destiny by scan 7 the drum patterns flows at a good pace while the higher end sounds give the track a nice uplifting feel the balance in this production is great as the beats flow at a good pace while the intricate pads and sounds smother beats and make this a smooth as silk production scan x then take us on a 7 minute journey to psychedelic techno land with a very upbeat dance floor killer in transit from the word go the track is at peak time with furious beats and a droning baseline that gives this production a very high energy level the electro sounds rise in and out of the production in great style much like the baseline culminating in a truly great display of banging techno at its finest it s quite hard not to really like this release 2 contrasting production on each side with the smooth and delightful final destiny for the early set moments while the immense transit is sure to do some serious damage late in the night great stuff coming out of this french label at the moment
last years gorgeous one showed that for all his idiosyncrasies could turn out a bona fide anthem when he wanted to on the la producers apron debut that function is performed by p a r t y though this time deep house romanticism is replaced by something sleazier its compact ruthlessly funky groove is pure early 80s prince right down to the itchy flares of synth but the framing is house the sultry half-spoken tone adopted by davis and cohort brings to mind moodymann regardless its the sort of sex-charged dance floor heater that doesnt come around that often elsewhere davis indulges his more wayward tendencies veering between soulful warmth and machine-led weirdness in a way that suits kinevens label nicely in fact kineven takes more than a back seat role: the version of supplied is his edit its filter-happy boogie-house bump would be at home on one of his own 12-inches which is not to denigrate it or the similarly constructed closer one bit the remaining two tracks are odder and even more fascinating is almost (but not quite) disastrously loose its offbeat percussion flying every which way the clipped snare hits and chords in meanwhile are bursts of light in an otherwise surprisingly dark landscape theres a deep house tune in there somewhere but its so obscured that it comes out like trippy peak-time techno its confusing in other words but glorious too

son of keep it elements ; apart from sounding like the lunch menu at a californian colonic irrigation convention hey dude raw is the law this creeping fascination with rawness pre-supposes that as long as electronic music is delivered with flaws and blemishes its valid such blanket contentions are always suspicious the fact that one of the tracks on this ep is called as would immediately arouse doubt were it not for the fact that is the author despite being a relative newcomer napoletanos work has featured on respected imprints like jamal mosss mathematics as well as yore and laid the track in question is dreamier than its title suggests with rolling congas and subtle filtered chords taking the edge off the backing drums is of a similar disposition its shifting percussion providing the basis for dreamy synths but once again the backing beats sound rough around the edges but napoletano finally delivers what many only promise on devoid of melodies or musical elements its concrete-weight drums allow him to deliver a killer percussive workout that progresses from rolling snares into tight claps powered by distorted bass licks it adds up to a primal sound that no amount of lazy revisionism can emulate
is a fully improvised fusion record inspired by miles davis unlike the trad-jazz and evil funk the late legend unleashed on the world in the 70s the elements combined on sketches are aybees increasingly abstract house and afrikan sciences unique take on west coast beat music the combination doesnt sound much like either artist on his own both musicians have roots in oakland but aybees decamped for berlin this record is the result of jam sessions in both cities and contains the most challenging sounds either artist has committed to vinyl the duo allegedly werent so much inspired by daviss music as his pioneering spirit exemplified by his mid-career search for a new genre here theyve arrived on one via a wild combination of electro drums kosmische synths and lurching funk with the three-part seem intent on taking the listener on an arduous journey through space the record starts with the duo fiddling with their synthesizers for a solid two minutes before settling on a rough cowbell-and-snare rhythm their musical esp is palpable you can sense their unspoken communication as they gradually build and then tear apart the beats slathering the drums in space echo since kubrick used strausss also sprach zarathrustra to begin and end 20 : a space odyssey every space epic has needed a memorable theme sure enough a triumphant synth line is introduced eight minutes into the opening track on sketches thats about all the listener is given to latch onto if one heralds the brave explorers upon launch two is a turbulent journey through the asteroid belt a pair of synthesizer chords are distorted to the point of clipping over the pieces 15-minute runtime its a difficult unsettling listen the cycles theme reemerges in three before a long ambient cool-down the improvisations that follow are slightly more approachable bearing a resemblance to the propulsive stew of miles on the corner one mixes rhodes and organ with searing psychedelic guitars two begins with stuttering funky drums that are eventually jettisoned for a cinematic outro the albums closer whats uses creeping synth and a monotone vocal sample that sounds like hal informing the duo that theyll remain trapped in space forever nothing is easy with this record the drum programming is restless and erratic keyboard lines are hammered for marathon stretches and each track has an ominous lurching feel that said fans of truly adventurous music will find plenty to love here if the goal was to go where no man has gone before then i suppose theyve succeeded the question is how many listeners will be brave enough to join them
illinois-born producer jessica phillippes recent tracks have the feel of an artist trying new things and making generally very listenable music while doing it her last full release for claude vonstrokes 2011s the barbary coast ep ran the gamut from tech house to slo-mo booty bass while coefficient a standout from last years players (part 1) label compilation was pure rattling berlin techno the title track here falls somewhere between techno machine-funk and ghetto-tech with slowly rising and falling bass and stark percussion surrounding a vocal sample that was inspired in her words by a ghetto tech record that shall remain nameless though the original has a certain eyes-down appeal phillippe and remix is stonger kicking off with a faster hats-and-kicks groove it slips the vocal in as a cog in a much more linear machine which is completed by rushing hats deliciously dark acid synths and fluttering arps meanwhile phillippe melds growling vocal echoes with melodramatic synths and deliberate percussion to create an enjoyably menacing piece of slo-mo house

while its obvious from a cursory listen that the bizarrely named (gareth munday to his parents) is a big fan of burial scratch the surface and you will find plenty more on offer than a mere imitation munday has taken the key elements of burials sound (gritty beats plaintive vocals and wistful melodies) and stitched them together in his own way the two tracks that make up the first side for example are more indebted to modern deep house albeit fractured and mournful rather than burials reclamation of old school rave the beats are consequently shaped more sensually than dubsteps traditional urban clangour particularly on an where they slither and skip captivatingly and sensually below the bassline its the second side that impresses most however the title track works like an ambient piece despite the ruthless hi-hat flickering like an angry insect waves of drowned voices shimmering arpeggios and creeping noise are swept into the whirlpools of deep dub bass contrast is the most straightforward dance floor track coming across like shattered house glued back together in small pieces at high speed the richer melodic layers and mischievous percussion build a more hopeful note to end an otherwise moody ep overall an impressive debut and a bold side step for away from their familiar dub techno domain
appears here on pressure trax a label whose aesthetic seems perfectly in tune with the chileans its a platform for villalobos to serve up one of the more immediately accessible if still gratifyingly nuanced releases of his illustrious career on first contact theres not a huge difference between the two parts of part is the more upfront and perkier of the duo; part its weirder cousin adds jazzy xylophone and synth licks to the mix both share the same rhythmic complexity and schizoid vocal layering in fact youd be forgiven for thinking youd opened multiple browser tabs on soundcloud villalobos puts down a twitchy minimalist pitter-patter that at various points distorts into a barrage of hyperactive techno hi-hats a highly recognisable disco sample from first choices let no man out asunder as used on royal houses stone cold house classic can you party is dropped in and out seemingly at random a hummed vocal loop is a constant as is a british-accented female voice in the middleground stretched cut up and barely decipherable joined by a diabolic male who is little more than distorted noise sounds like a mess doesnt it yet these divergent elements are the records killer trick by presenting so much aural information to the listener villalobos ensures that engagement in the music is sky high
s catalogue spans nearly two decades but some of his best music has come in the last 18 months last year he released a 12-inch fatal flaw in disco whose a-side paid tribute to a type of house music championed by artists like masters at work lil louis and cajmere e-versions 7 also out last year channeled another house legend tony humphries the two mixes of dial ory were emulations of a kiss mix where humphries cut between two copies of audio from a phone call also released on ari goldmans comes with an insert that gives thanks to several dance music greats sevens reverence for houses legacy produces strong results here too though the ep is less consistent i need my people to hear this begins : the first of three tracks built around punchy drums and evangelical chat its a good track with lots going for it but the interplay between the chords and organs fails to create the magic spark of say fatal flaw in disco (u-4-ria) of s three versions is the strongest mood is pensive at first but sevens burrell brothers-style keyboards add a gorgeous shimmer other two tracks are more understated a mode in which falters only small details like : s offbeat horns and s vocal and kazoo combination manage to stand out but when its energy matches sevens devotion to 90s house is more likely to sway you

the best minimal tracks arent just snazzy loops but worlds to get lost in thats something risti ons a former student of classical music knows well the most memorable tunes in the romanian producers discography which dates back to 2010 are more than cuts for the club theyre deep meditative trips ons first double ep contains four more ranging from the melodic to the abstract its a well-rounded collection of tracks from a producer who aims to bewitch with music this stripped-down progression within tracks is essential and the tunes on have plenty theyre murky the kind of tracks that connect with clubbers minds more than their feet kick drums are entwined with muddy basslines that feel more psychedelic than functional as muted percussion and snippets of synths rattle around higher in the mix rual the only track with a real melodic presence will likely get the most spins theres a hint of melancholy in a short riff that could be from a detuned violin but a loud clap and an open hi-hat give the track a boost its hard to think of a situation outside lub der visionaere and a handful of clubs in romania where elestial or could work but any clubber still standing by the time theyre appropriate to play will get taken to another place
while all the recent talk of electro has centred around the nonplus+/swamp81 school of bass-heavy 808 fetishism (here in the uk at least) phil bollands has true to its name been quietly going about maintaining and building on a tradition which began long before instra:mentals latent influences became overt a succession of impressive vinyl and digital-only releases with contributions from the likes of matt whitehead silicone scally and finnish aces morphology have seen the label forge a sound which strikes the right kind of balance between genre classicism and dance floor functionality nowhere more so than here: s first release for the imprint and very possibly its strongest offering to date both originals pay their dues to detroit by way of body-rocking ur breaks and a rollicking feel-good ebm bassline and in the form of a smouldering c2-esque arpeggio lead and drifting outer space chords the latter in particular evokes that peculiar sense of melancholy futurism so unique to the motor city sound but in a genuine rather than deferential or worse parodic fashion remixes from label-boss sync and past delsin contributor dynarec take things into flagrantly peak-time territory: already something of a beast is given a healthy injection of acid-laden mutant funk queasy bass manic keys and a blabbering female vocal making for one hell of a panicky ride while digi-bonus gets maximalised beyond recognition a good thing if you like your kick drums booming and your synth lines brash unlike s hook-driven a-sides neither is the kind of track youll have lodged in your head come the end of the night but theyre certainly ones youll rock to while they play furiously
this is as far as i know s debut release and i cant say that i know that much about her other than that shes french and a dj by trade i could be wrong though so what to say about this release its hardly groundbreaking despite the inclusion of a mathew jonson remix s original opens with a moody bassline and it crackles into action nicely if unremarkably i cant say anything bad about this track because its exactly the type of sound that helps a crowd glide into action its got a lilting funk that keeps it playful mathew jonson ups the ante a bit keeping the tempo constant but injecting a bit of moodiness into proceedings its not one of his better efforts but he serves to lift things slightly with a trademark spiralling bass riff that interspersed with a mournful synth keeps things far away and interesting however its not your standard jonson length so does come across as a bit of an outtake blackwall meanwhile slows things down notably and delivers a plodding groove that has a vaguely electro feel to it but it seems a little too miserable to really animate keeping a similar dark feel to jonsons remix but losing the funk of either his or the original mix it lacks that certain something to lift it out of the mundane solid no-frills release simple in its original form and doing nothing wrong but relatively ordinary the remixes dont really satisfy much and feel limited
fter diving into technos deepest recesses with marcel dettmann norman nodge dvs1 and terrence dixon manchesters have apparently decided to linger a little longer in the shadows this time theyve linked up with whose debut release thrums with dark electricity jerking and snapping like a live wire dropped in water definitely has a little bit of drexciya in its dn a lineage played out in queasy dissonant synths and raw drum work rises back towards the light with soft pads cresting hopefully over a waterlogged murk and determined 909 hi-hats with the though its straight into the heart of mayhem mid-range synths have the ragged feel of vintage ebm the tumbling melody turns jeff mills bells on its head and the high-end is a riot of string vamps laser zaps cowbells and sirens with all those fireworks you might not even notice the depth charges below as an 808 mimics a walking bassline with tuned toms or something to that effect finally takes a victory lap through a cavernous expanse of tri-tones flashing cymbals and pile-driving kicks like robert hood as heard from the back of an airplane hangar
release of her debut album last year coupled with a hectic tour schedule has meant that the past 12 months have been quietest in the studio since she broke onto the scene in 2010 what she has released a fabric mix and an ep with the folk duo gaps has been satisfactory at best lacking her trademark groovy magic her latest outing though recaptures some form for the londoner who returns to for the first time in three and a half years with a charismatic three-tracker having all but relinquished control of the mic on comfort coles calls on another guest vocalist on the eps title cut m ggli who has previously worked with marc romboy and shlomi aber is a compelling singer and her aching high-pitched delivery complements coles simple palette of shimmering synths and ping-pong melodies ts catchy and will slot comfortably into her catalogue of easily digestible club hits is just as easy to swallow constructing a cosy tech house roller from samples of a childs voice and twinkling pads t wraps things up with a slice of classic coles returning to the mic she repeats the tracks creepy title over smoky synths and a swollen bassline like all her best records its equal parts eerie and funky
whether its been the low-slung deep house of outboxx the organic techno of rhythmic theory or the sunrise stylings of jay l has become one of the more reliable labels on the uk scene the fifth release is from newcomer and it makes a case for being the labels strongest to date you lovin ( aby) is contemporary uk house at its very best sultry pads slide over a bed of airy kicks and claps supporting an irresistible female vocal s the vocal roams freely a rubbery bassline is introduced which is later adorned with a lustrous set of synths warm and uplifting itll have you basking in summer memories well into winter is considerably tougher applying dense ripples to a brawny kick and bass combo sparkling synths add light to the track marking this out as another strikingly mature effort lovin ( aby) manages to reference houses golden age without coming across as trite or gimmicky
larry heard reviving his mr fingers alias for the projects first new release in decades remains a major highlight of there hasnt been any more original music since that february release though the remixes that followed (not to mention his rebirth mix ) were solid now heard further extends the year of mr fingers with his remix of an exclusive d m funk track from his recent dj kicks this inspired rework is paired with nite jewel and d m funks collaborative you me (also from dj kicks ) both are synthy and smooth and a natural extension of everyone involved despite coming from different eras locations and genres heard and damon riddick seem to share a fair bit of common ground at least musically speaking in the mr fingers version of riddicks original synth hook a tender and spritely little phrase takes on a new clarity its soft glow turned from distant to earnest and when its paired with a plush 4/4 sparse percussion rubbery bass and aqueous pads the music recalls vintage deep house given the slightest dose of funk heard further enriches the track with a quiet wandering piano sonorous voices and about halfway through his own slow grooving bassline; only the rudimentary strings he drops in for four quick measures are an unwelcome addition aside from that each element of the remix blends together seamlessly as if written collaboratively from the beginning
theres a system built around lars holdhus has said of his musical project its not like i composed a track because i feel like that this day its more like its needed for the system to function the nature of that system is anybodys guess holdhuss titles offer no further clues: here as elsewhere in his discography theyre an unintelligible cyphertext of letters and numbers an eye-boggling barcode that cant be easily remembered or referenced in conversation accordingly holdhus seems to want his music to be treated as a cryptic stream of data: vast ambiguous unknowable if so hes fudging things slightly and he surely knows it a recent mix from the berlin-based norwegian hinged on a couple of gorgeously romantic ennio morricone tracks breaking like great barnacled whales through the digital surf likewise his debut is at its best when it displays a knack for oh-so-human drama particularly in the grand turbulent opener that tracks melodramatic bent and spiralling trance synths recall parts of m e s h s scythians ep; the janus affiliate is probably holdhus most obvious contemporary besides arca but this eps combination of glacial ambience and rumbling digital disturbance equally recalls an earlier generation of computer music explorers namely raster-noton the comparison isnt entirely favourable where alva noto and co specialised in breathtaking sonic clarity holdhuss compositions while gorgeous often feel a tad clogged their surfaces dulled through application of low-calibre pitchshifting and other extreme processing then again perhaps thats the point holdhus reflects his times and in the 20 s the romantic image of the maverick musician-scientist in his hi-tech lab has been replaced by that of the hacker or pirate cobbling stuff together with freeware and cracked software before launching it into the web its an aesthetic of expedience as much as artistry which isnt to denigrate it at all holdhus vinyl debut is absorbing and in places deeply affecting even if its ultimate purpose remains buried beneath lines of code

frances sound system expands its d-i-r-t-y label roster with a 12-inch from lisbon newbies who deliver some forward-thinking danceable electro but are upstaged by a rowdy remix from in-house duo discodeine last year d-i-r-t-y made a quick and substantial mark with a string of boldly eclectic disco edits by pilooski that ranged from mon duul to frankie valli whose deep-soul number eggin once re-spliced for maximum sweat became an unlikely smash hit this was followed up by discodeines texas gladiators ep an innovative chunk of stripped sizzling tech-disco the addition of to this party seems wholly apt: their work maintains a tricky balance between a strong sense of style and the wide-eyed intuition that its crew well-reputed for is powered by avant metal machine -style guitar abrasion: stabs of flatliner-feedback jut into the mix and then dogfight with some seriously inebriated acid bass its full of wobbly detours and swerves which make it sound less it was designed by a computer and more like a live take from an extended robot jam session ut the wail never really takes virtuoso flight: it hovers and ping-pongs and once it shimmers back into the void the drums arent quite sure how to deal with it opting finally to peter out in some noncommittal dub sputter the whole track is a sort of club-conscious mirror image of productions by lo-fi indie electronic groups like fuck uttons and invisible conga people who dabble in noisy techno mutations on the flip the discodeine mix seems less like a recontextualization than simply a more polished version of the original theyve harnessed the originals wild electrical change and used it to power the pistons of a hypnotic disco machine instead of wilding out the now-tamed fuzzy sonics evoke the static electricity globes used in science class then a wordless joyful each oys-style group vocal the kind that discodeine has used to great effect on earlier tracks like ring modulation shows up to clear the space like air after a spring rain on the whole theres a lot to read in the titles is for sure a wobbly tightrope act and the discodeine mix indeed both narcotizes and gets it ready for the floor the pair works best as a two-part suite from an almost jammed-out noise solo into a wired-tight club stormer
starts with a kiss and erupts like a firework display every moment of gilded strings cooing voices ecstatic birdsong sparkles an outpouring of joy we havent heard from bj rk in years its the first sign that her emotional landscape has shifted since vulnicura the 2015 album inspired by her breakup with the artist matthew barney though is something of a companion to its predecessor both coproduced by arca both featuring classical instrumentation paired with glitchy beats its also the complete opposite on she sings of how the chest wound on the cover of vulnicura has become a channel through which to give and receive love heavy strings are replaced by ethereal flutes and bj rks lyrics turn from sour and introspective to giddy and wondrous as if embracing the new people and feelings around her sound palette of is bright and airy flutes pan pipes and other woodwinds make up the main instrumentation as tactile but ephemeral as a warm breath on the back of your neck its rich with life including birdsong some was recorded by bj rk in iceland; some was taken from hekura david toops 1980 lp of field recordings collected between venezuela and the amazon y serve as looped rhythmic accents on the title track and sonic wallpaper on the beautiful where the chirps blend in with reedy flutes arca who bj rk says was more involved in this album he cowrote five songs and coproduced all but one works carefully here his sickly pitch-shifting and percussion more integrated than on vulnicura some songs centre around budding obsessions and new relationships celebrates the seemingly mundane aspects of modern courtship: nerding out over music sharing mp3s texting all day lp is full of songs about love marked by classical flourishes but written in sometimes plainspoken language i care for you she bellows simply and repeatedly on way she sings about love feels broad and universal vacillates between physical love ( his hands are good in protecting me / touching me and caressing me ) and something more abstract ( our physical union a fantasy / i just fell in love with a song ) occasionally nods to turmoil dark clouds rolls in with the stunning coproduced by rabit which pairs harp strings with thundering drums as bj rk remembers good times from a doomed relationship the music behind her is a duel between positive and negative thoughts thats followed by the grotesque-sounding which references a bitter custody battle as bj rk sings ive ducked and dived / like the mother in solomans tale / to spare our girl / i wont let her get caught in all of it and then theres the clearing of where she sings of wanting to spare daughters from the fuckups of the fathers its part of the lps larger theme of cleansing and motherhood where positives can come even from negatives of course not every word on should be read as autobiography lp is its own world though some of it is refracted through vulnicura s lens references the previous albums visual motifs and mory is a lyrical response to vulnicura s desolate centrepiece black lake where her heart was once an enormous lake black with potion mory is about fighting through mental fatigue and depression and emerging on the other side ( n my body memory kicks in she sings i redeem myself ) both songs are extended epics but the icelandic choir and uplifting drums on mory fill the void of black lake dark liquid that once represented bj rks emptiness becomes a source of love that gushes and flows through her where once it felt suffocating here it feels open and endless
those of us who want to retain our sanity tend to ignore message board posts but one recent comment on i love music claiming that nowadays rob hood merely phones in his releases resonated with me t first i disagreed; while his seminal work dates from the mid to late 90s the three hoodmusic installments of recent years show that the detroit producer still operates on a higher plane than his peers however his new remix of en klock was a disappointment and this new ep is unlikely to rank as a career highlight maybe its because it comes so soon after the reissue of his minimal nation album and therefore pales in comparison as nearly all techno records would but it does still feel like hood is travelling on autopilot revolves around what sounds like a time-stretched pitch-bent slap bass with hoods trademark building jagged high hats bursts of distortion and steely rhythms lending it the requisite dance floor clout is less linear and more distinctive with grubby squelchy beats providing the basis for niggling percussion and chiming melodic sequences it doesnt compare with the pace or minus but more importantly it lacks the dynamic exuberance of more recent outings like nd then we planned our escape while other techno producers would have sold their mothers to produce this record it sounds like as the poster suggested his heart isnt in it at the moment dont fail us now rob; more than ever techno needs your unique touch
is bristol producer amos childs and mc alex rendall together they sound like king krule rapping over beats rza might have made after a few too many all-nighters their contribution to 2013s young echo collective album nexus was the lps most sleepy-eyed passage and now spread over a whole 12-inch their music feels especially dazed of course thats part of the appeal the metallic screech that comes in after 40 seconds of the hushed speech-sample introduction cuts like a katana across the eardrum but the duo rarely reach that level of tension again from the staticky uneven hum of through to the slo-mo dubstep of childs and rendall revel in silence that also puts rendalls vocals in sharp relief and they only hold up half the time inspired at their best and like hackneyed slam poetry at their worst hes joined on a few tracks by an uncredited female vocalist who duels with rusty strings on the fantastically eerie dont and duets with rendall on the hollowed-out trip-hop of hinting at bristols rich heritage of downtrodden music as sonically interesting as is it recedes back into the shadows a little too soon without offering much to stick in your brain show a lot of promise but their latest ep is too illusory to really grab you
kowtons new project with hyetal follows collaborations with peverelist dusk and julio ashmore the producers styles hyetals woozy electronica and kowtons tough mix of techno and grime come together beautifully on their first record which is also the first for ristols and both riff on a vangelis-style synth loop on the former a dubwise menace grows steadily more intense rattling hard in an eyes-down groove like a lot of kowtons music this is a drum-led track with muddy claps and dry percussion at the very front of the mix feels more like hyetals baby its distant vocal open snares and pearly synths are less forbidding than the eerie dub atmosphere of but a satisfying bass whomp and driving techno pulse mean its anything but lightweight

the final track on s fourth ep features a vocal sample about how bass frequencies can heal the mind followed by the return of an ear-splitting percussive pattern theres something to be said for the disconcerting unease of spooky electronic music by the likes of demdike stare and focus group but montreals take this aesthetic idea to a more mechanistic place building tracks from hunks of industrial detritus and splinters of discarded steel beats that sound like they could be composed of both factory machinery and the flinty click of malfunctioning lighters the industrial symphony of suddenly sidelining itself in favour of a vocal breakdown is like some bizarro disney movie where the machines come to life and playfully scare the shit out of unsuspecting people their fourth release hello lonely hold the nation is the first to be picked up by an outside label but its by no means a compromise beginning with near formlessness sets forth a torturously deliberate beat that lurches over what sounds like a crackling fire pit (they give us flames instead of basslines but even those are maddeningly inconsistent ) later on mavericks it sounds like the flames overtook the hardware somewhere in between songs as blackened hollowed-out beats sound off resignedly carrying with them the intrinsic heat of the flames without any of that brilliant light that usually goes along with them indeed this ep deals in various shades of darkness starting with complete black and progressing until the final track wherein the elements finally come together to form something that sounds vaguely like a dubstep track the assembly-line beats coalesce into something familiar with streaks of light emerging in between the cracking facade like water trickling through imperceptibly fractured rock
youre never paddling in the shallows with whether its opalescent and upward-facing for l i e s a bit taught and overcast for syncrophone recordings or something far moodier for sheik n beik or i/y the frenchman always drags you towards the pools murky depths where a surprise is often lying in wait his latest on is no different deeply charismatic techno is on display throughout the strung-out and sweaty is worth a mention for how it keeps the tension both at a fever-pitch and weirdly lax takes another line creeping towards its noisy expulsions with slow and meticulous intent but its that evokes the greatest emotional response theres something so druggy and intoxicating about how it bears down on you from all sides causing you to collapse inwardly along with it its a slow dirge against the sludgiest of waters but incites delirious joy instead of anxiety you can play again and again and still not manage to work it all out rarely does it get more potent wonderful and terrifying than this
has never been exactly mild-mannered; flitting between techno and garage his releases so far have balanced slinky cadences with a grim intensity even at its most ecstatic like clk recovery his music has an ominous cast conjuring characters youd cross the street to avoid is his meanest cut yet with bone-cracking drums and a corrosive fm bass wobble it feels like a wasteland inside the tracks contours with just a skeleton of a garage rhythm holding together the evil gelatinous low end gobbling up everything in its path even cannibalizing its own appendages is as malevolently hungry as the carnivorous house plant in little shop of horrors is hammered home with diamond-hard drums arrayed in a shuddering stuttering electro cadence; it sounds a little like phex twin re-imagined for erghain for a producer only on his third release s sound design is awesome to behold from the shape and force of his drums to the sumptuousness of his synthesizers on the synths are in constant motion morphing and flickering and theres a melodic bass passage that might take your breath away made all the more powerful by the fact that it only happens once even within a single song appears intent upon not repeating himself
up next on the ever consistent label is a nice chunky slab of house music provided by hiratzka kazell entitled it is sure to get some great reactions with both the original mix and future funk mix doing the rounds on this release the original mix gets going from the outset with some a chunky drum loop and a very evil and sinister baseline roaring the track into gear the track flows nicely for the first half before it enters a nice and weird phase of the production where the beats are a little more disjointed and the effects become sporadic this then leads into the concluding minutes where the baseline yet again plays a vital role combined with the unique set of beats the future funk mix maintains the great quirky vibe set up by the drums but the reworking uses more of a rolling baseline and some nice synthy effects the breakdown deep into the track adds a little melodic touch to the overall production before the track closes out in style another great release by this label and a great follow up the very big release by chable bonnici
much has been made of the new track on s ovum ep which more than reminds listeners of jeff mills classic changes of life considering the fact that the mp3 i received in a promo mailout curiously calls it keys of life (a previous title perhaps ) when i pull it up in winamp should tell you that the bulgarian producer knows exactly what hes doing the problem indeed isnt the inspiration its that unlike his similarly melodic work for undertones last year he doesnt seem to do all that much with it there are no unexpected twists and turns no surprises thats what has made s resolutely backward-looking catalogue so fascinating thus far in concert with neville watson he often does little more than regurgitate classic acid house tropes but alone the wobbling line that finds its way into near its end elevates it from mere mimicry meanwhile submerges its bleeps in a dunk tank while chords placidly play out over the surface like his best work it takes familiar elements but combines them in a way that you havent heard before s someone who relies on such obvious referents s releases always skirt the line between goofus and gallant there are few better examples than this ep
is a well-known fact the very idea of existed in tigas head way before the actual band itself dave 1 and p-thugg were recruited by turbo recordings in the early 2000s they were already producing beats for various montreal hip-hop artists though so the switch from rap moguls to digital funkers la hall oates s very own heroes as it still appears to this date was less a question of trading musical genres than passing from producing to performing personas and by the time their first album shes in control was released in 2004 it was all working very well today however sadly just sounds pass touted as a more complex and musical offering the duos third album is surprisingly unsurprising musically speaking songs on here are interchangeable with any songs from the previous two albums in terms of actual content dave 1 still likes women and he still likes to talk about them yet despite the presence of female vocalists like on album opener they usually remain in the realm of indexical signs just look at their albums artwork: lipstick traces and satin gloves here impeccably shaved legs there this time we are greeted by the perfectly shaped ass of a secretary who is probably er in control looks like she might have fancy footwork too so much for a change eh business as usual then desire to move beyond the template they set for themselves over the course of their career so far couldnt be more apparent than on at first it seems the song only revisits the perky synthetic thrill of early single needy girl but as it goes well above the seven minutes mark you can tell it aims for great things but definitely outstays its welcome (a feeling discrete cowbell-like chimes car horns a rapped middle eight and an interminable directionless coda cant seem to alleviate) first single dont the light on the other hand is just deceptively dull and even an aeroplane remix cant do much to salvage it the gives more room to the female backing vocalist to a point where it almost could be a taylor dayne collaboration (now wouldnt that be something truly sexy ) and it is all the better for it dont is a diverting attempt at grasping the kind of string-laden disco thrill the duo explored on their dj kicks compilation last year while the french-sung ballad jai claqu is surprisingly low-key and well sweet but it would be a stretch to call them authoritative album ends with a rather pleasant if not slightly uneventful mid-tempo number and the more successfully upbeat which takes its cue from the kind of white funk patrick leonard produced for madonna circa 1986 yet overall it is hard to shake the feeling youve heard and seen all of this before if was indeed a great idea a decade ago inhabiting a terrain left aside by electroclash and every other 1980s pillagers after that it now seems that idea has run its course whether they were meant to be cynical ironists right from the start or whether they meant it in a truly genuine way doesnt really matter at this point: like one famous english poet who knew a thing or two about authenticity once said that joke isnt (that) funny anymore

julio bashmores hook-up with fellow bristol producer hyetal returns with two moreish space-funk expeditions while most of us were sleeping off christmas dinner played santa on december 25th releasing into the digital ether now with the addition of the duo gives a full release to their first new material since 2010s the velvet collection shows some of the signifiers that have highlighted hyetals work particularly the 80s electro snares its a bit of cameo here a bit of jan hammer there brought up to date with crushing echo-laden bass synths and quirky touches like turntable stops and a heavily treated ragga sample on theres the booming bassline/kick combo thats become bashmores trademark slowed to near hip-hop pace the two producers add helicoptering synths and off-kilter claps

symbolism can be tricky in electronic music within such an amorphous mode of expression even cogent metaphors or allusions can seem like non sequiturs this could be why avant-garde groups like matmos or abyfather work with tangible themes or why certain experimental club artists use imagined narratives largely for aesthetics the two london-based artists known only as a and d go beyond simple single-serving concepts ir holistic approach involves music visuals live performance physical objects djing and more in an effort to as theyve explained invite a way of looking at things differently s third album (or psi ) comes five years after the first in 011 glaqjo xaacso came out of nowhere and enticed the electronic music world it was mysterious and aloof like an actress record but also came packed with a handful of banging tracks perhaps most importantly the album had no conceptual barriers of entry a colorful enigma that didnt ask to be solved project grew more dense and inscrutable once signed to warp many of glaqjo xaacso s straightforward pleasures were absent from its follow-up 014s estoile naiant and it made digging through the jumbled nebulous electronics much less rewarding cleverly returns to the skewed body music on s first album which nearly offsets the tangle of blurred gestures and garbled theorizing opening with a randomized arp sequence tumbles down the albums overgrown path of disjointed rhythms and untethered fx res a multitracked voice calmly chanting amidst the din but what exactly its saying or what its meant to bring to the non-musical disarray is unclear presence of new member a and her quiet monotone is more textural than anything else her words are often so processed and muffled that they almost dont register as human relegated to another layer of s mayhem anthemic uses experimental club music as building blocks for its song-based electronica which might have worked better if a wasnt merely set adrift in its mangled beats and work better than most harnessing trance trap industrial and bass music signifiers into something unrecognizable yet emotionally resonant in both tracks the quiet poignance of as voice can be heard maximalism is a major tenet of s sound but its problematic for s clubby hybrids listening to a quasi-rap over the heavy bounce of lade s beat is a thrill at first until it becomes clear that its anxious synth loop isnt going anywhere and sounds are continually piled on top such onslaughts are the norm and they can turn interesting ideas into an overstimulating slog when things open up in places as on excellent instrumentals pixa o and its a rare joy to take in each slick slanted sound seems emblematic of and the project as a whole it starts with an unusually sparse arrangement: kick snare hi-hat and a squiggle of synth beat comes together punching and stuttering as a jumps in with her half-intelligible verse even if you cant understand her words theres a feeling of conviction in their delivery and it anchors you in the uncanny music n the change comes: the vocals are deconstructed and timestretched the beat becomes random and erratic and the melodic elements are almost indecipherable from the atonal noises what starts as a captivating lucid song becomes bloated and smeared beyond recognition the only line that makes sense is when a says at the end of each stanza now forever if was supposed to communicate something its significance was lost in the excess of ideas
sometimes all you need is a good bassline knows this well and its beginning to seem like he can write them in his sleep let it go built around low-end that could drive a pop song ignited his success last year and now the man from tring returns to for the first time since that single here he aligns himself with the jaunty low-end of dirtybird emphasizing his willingness to be playful amidst the uks current wave of deep house neither track is terribly original but both ooze with his personality: jumpy hyper and incapable of staying still ut in a way they dont offer much else -side has trouble finding its path with passages that feel awkwardly disparate in mood held together only by the tracks low-end unfortunately the vocal never quite clicks sounding pasted on even off-key further displaying his uk mongrel pedigree minces classic hardcore rave synths with us garage-style organ riffs adding a little something extra to the well-overused 90s house template its the more convincing of the two but still feels derivative maybe you do need more than just a good bassline
while s buzzing less-is-more sci-fi beats bear all the hallmarks of a sound we techno nerds should have been feelin years their discography nearly all of it put out on cassettes issued by swedens long-running b rft records is intimidating to say the least luckily more contemporary scandinavian labels like sex tags mania ( whom b rft has obviously been quite influential) and are beginning to preach the gospel and the latter labels second release from the trio (their first triffid gossip flew off the shelves) exemplifies all thats ruggedly seductive about these guys you probably couldnt have without tape hiss that warm hum that penetrates their every reverby clap and 303 meander: you hear it from the moment dials up and even when the tracks loud lovingly saturated drum machines slink in you can still sense its com ting presence there its even more present on the quieter which recalls contemporary electronic tricksters like pye corner audio and dj sotofett even though its ethos long predates them could be the template in its entirety: all the right drum machines do all the right things at a more than leisurely tempo and the slinkiest zappiest and most devastating of them all seems to cut off mid-sentence which begs one question of : can you make this a trilogy please
having built up a fairly decent reputation in psy trance circles with their releases as midimiliz producers rne schaffhausen and wayan raabe first caused a stir among the erlin centric minimal community in the spring of 2005 when they adopted the name to release soopertrack on james holden s tranced up techno label order community melancholic uplifting and dancefloor effective all at the same time soopertrack quite vigorously lived up to its title and remains for this reviewer at least one of order community s finest releases since then s productions have sounded less groundbreaking less vital but they ve not made a bad record that i m aware of now they weigh in with a 12 for traum enlisting the services of for side eginning with a growling melodic bassline builds and builds to admit the ascending ethereal synth lines we ve come to associate with order community and the ahem trendy trance sound ut while soopertrack anchored its builds with clipped tight programming down below is full of unrefined percussion sounds cheap synthetic sounding woodblocks and snares and galloping hi hats that sit far too loud in the mix it s not as unpleasant as i perhaps suggest but when so many producers out there are achieving unprecedented feats of depth and discernment in the composition of dancefloor fodder sounds just a bit too maximal for its own good the tune is far more likely to find favour with old fashioned prog jocks and the electro house by numbers types than with those forward thinking djs who were caning soopertrack two years ago the meaty bleepy electronic riffage is pretty addictive but in a world where we re almost buckling under the weight of super high quality 4x4 this track just seems surplus to requirement on the flip you ll find a more subtle and agreeably trancey number the spine tingling ambient synths and driving bassline are slightly reminiscent of minilogue s girl from otany ay but it s not really fair comparison; s pretensions to the status of epic remain exactly that pretensions gain those boorish percussion motifs that clatter between the kicks quickly begin to irritate and you reach the track s end with no real sense of having spent the last six minutes wisely isn t a bad record but all the same two years have passed and we re still waiting for to live up to the promise of soopertrack personally i ve given up
proof that a simple kick drum battered to an inch of its life can still elicit hysteria erlin-based greek producer blurs the boundaries between strident techno and uptempo house with so tech house yes er no actually this is techno with house staples snatched female vocal piercing synth stabs as a side dish the gritty bass/drum interplay threatens to be eqed out of existence at the breakdown but its patently obvious that gaia knows the quartz-tough piledriving rhythm could eat it for breakfast if it fancied it eventually arrives back on the scene to drive the point home erghain resident ryan ts take on techno is not as strident as gaias approach here preferring to dispense with the brutal assault of the original in favour of twinkling hi-hats and a metronomic percussive thwack in fact the bassline is pushed so far back in the mix that it almost disappears overwhelmed by ethereal pads that peak and then fall away
ricosh is first emerged on dj kozes xlr8r podcast where its saccharine lyrics and heart string targeted chords slotted neatly into a mix two steps removed from the dance floor there it kind of worked it was the bass collapsing in on itself in a robag wruhme esque spiral that stood at the fore without the mixs context though you only notice the vocal cloying and made yet sweeter by accompanying strings its a strange choice for a label as odd and interesting as which normally hits the emotional functional sweet spot bang on thankfully the flip from is back on more familiar ground s hes shown on cuts for moodmusic and most recently kompakt the erliners got a knack for balancing clout and atmosphere s beat lollops through a swarm of pads chattering cowbells and maybe human vocals to pin structure to something otherwise shapeless its music to get lost in at 5 m whether youre still on the dance floor or on the long drive home
this the second label compilation on relands thoughtful tle udio is the quintessential drum bass s record three disc collection is packed with varied and eminently mixable beats from a cherry picked roster ir vision of drum bass is comfortingly literate and artcore but what ultimately makes tle udio vol worthwhile is label head s talent for sequencing music while at first blush vol seems to suffer well known album symptoms an excess of music a few downtempo diversions highlighting versatility a certain self consciousness these concerns finally fade away tracks on its two unmixed discs are immaculately paced so much that you can hear a story in the silences between vol also on point was a timid release in comparison vol is a breezy and expansive listen and this is surprising given that its emotional palette ranges from quietly optimistic to darkly quiet makes a welcome (if beatless) return with his to the first disc and reinforced virtuoso sounds as effortless as ever on a healthy volley of drums stepping on classic synths most of the names that follow are less familiar and their styles are harder to pin down fter a tribal stomp courtesy of san dra follows a track entitled taking that is borderline braindance and youd be forgiven if you expected three hours of wanton diversity but then clear the table with their monstrous a locked cabin full of angry drum kits thrashing at the door nother highlight and has the low end gravitas of a happy (well happier) boymerang; and its deftly flipped on its head the reverb drenched snares of s tentative res a journey made every six minutes and sometimes within individual tracks for instance in how s shifts from utonomic style restraint to lush junglist drum interplay in the blink of an eye (to say nothing of s wild electroacoustic songs jazz via laptop ) second fiercer disc has s submerged offshore style synthetics giving way to s long unreleased squirmer ; s nearly prog techstepper balanced with s writhing and minimal ; retro pache breaks moving to motor city soul as hands it off to nd though there are few of the monumental moments of drum bass in its heyday the contemporary wobble and hiss of s being a great exception there is also little of its stern over determination its paralyzing lust for genius and perfection tle udio here betrays a stargazing outlook turned outward rather than inward t lets drum bass feel somehow of all things playful s back catalogue mix on the third disc ebbs and flows like water his percussive showcase reveals another side to tle that the painstakingly sequenced vol mix missed res a real exuberance to be found in drumfunk choppage leftfield drum bass and otherwise jungle in the 2 s ts a secret best expressed a s optimism might be rare but its also contagious
is the solo project of federico maccherone who was one half of life and death-affiliated duo clockwork on his solo debut he takes his groups graceful melodies and cloaks them in black offering a headier floor-focused version of their soft analogue techno that nicely lines up with nonpluss aesthetic sounds like its trying to keep its swirling melody at bay giving the otherwise uplifting chord progression an ominous tinge an alternate mix lets those synths fly a little further but the methodical march of the percussion makes it all the more world-weary has a similar feel keeping big-room elements in careful suspension and only letting the kick drums drop every once in a while its a bit like a sputtering engine those analogue drums often sharp and crunchy scuff the polish right off these tunes which are lush yet rarely glossy the gritty contrast is most evident on where a billowing arpeggio duels with boxy snares but its also in whose surging synths are buried under filters until they sound like the distant hum of plumbing driving the dance floor with tension rather than release milennium shows that maccherones melodic dexterity works wonders in all kinds of settings
s nonplus+ label has gone from redefining atmospheric drum bass to becoming one of the uks most reliable outposts for dark and moody techno oing back to the very first release theres a thread that ties it all together its hard to describe but its there music on nonplus+ tends to sound decidedly robotic the sum of its automated parts somehow more stirring than most labels first full length compilation exhibits s keen ring with a collection of club tracks as sleek and stylish as ever brings together label regulars and a few newcomers like and ach producer turns in his most chrome plated productions where every glimpse of melody takes on a neon glow s brilliantly icy is one of his best ndians is jacking house of a erculean sort turns in an uncharacteristically straight banger with the short but dense se ts key element is a classic house style organ turned cold nd things gets even darker: s creepy quivver loads his typically skeletal framework with violent lunges of sub bass and a skin crawling vocal sample s latest collaboration with ate is among their most rabid and feverish work to date which brings us to the latters ig t an anthem that sits in the middle of the package like a hydrogen bomb waiting to go off and whose title itself is a handy decoder for what nonplus+ is doing to house cliches: mangling them while still acknowledging their purpose vocal sample tattoos itself on your brain in that inimitable way but listen closely and its bellowing into a vacuum ven while hes helping to define the future isnt one to forget his roots placed near the end is an old track from the original utonomic triumvirate nstra:mental s ts taut drum bass tick feels quaint in the midst of its strange bedfellows but it also gains a certain power a reminder of the heights the label achieved in a completely different world only a few years ago and the vast distance its travelled since

the dutch trio that is the team up to deliver on the imprint mix 1 is quite a solid production from the lads as it builds with a smooth baseline and some very good drums there is a subtle guitar like riff that also builds the track until it hits the main breakdown that sees some very smooth effects come into the track and most importantly a quite simply awesome gritty baseline that takes control and gives the track a super energy great stuff on the a-side mix 2 is quite good with a much smoother baseline employed compared to the grittiness of the a-side this mix has a more trancey feel to it with some more epic synths used as well as a series of twisted synths and effects used midway in a pretty good release here by the with the a-side in particular standing out for me
music has released through or has been bleak blistering and generally devoid of cuddly qualities that doesnt mean the labels releases which save a bjarki 1 inch from this summer have all been various artists compilations arent a lot of fun sound is pitch black yet mischievous and though the producers are occasionally aggressive in their avoidance of easy melody their tracks can bring a kind of twisted smile to your face s third compilation doesnt deviate from that script or push the label further out but if youve enjoyed s selections so far theres more to love here ts hard to choose a standout the tracks set to punishing tempos and oozing with trippy sound design tend to blend together even a dozen listens in re are notable earworms though like the accidental musicality of a monotone voice uttering the ep title in russian on s opening cut s own voice makes for another one on where a few heavily processed lines lifted from r kellys famous single of the same name (yes you read that right) warm up a brutally direct drum track s the titular percussion elements are timbral shapeshifters swelling before burrowing deep into the mix and re emerging as stealthy zaps other tracks vie for attention by accentuating their extremes we get a peculiar sort of youthful vigor from 17 year old whose tumble down synth lines blast at an unwieldy 14 bpm s ( ) is only a hair slower no doubt dragged down by the heaps of sonic mud thrown onto the mix not much more than the outline of a low end and a faint click make it past collections two tracks sweat inducing even through headphones are the eps hardest charging all booming kicks and hands in the air synth loops but theyre reasonably simple pleasures in the context of this collection another sign that with is on a tear
most scenes whether based around electro in the hague house music in chicago or dubstep in croydon have been driven by producers for the past few years though a group of mostly berlin-based djs have been carving out a niche for themselves simply by digging for forgotten records spacey house techno and electro has been their main sound and until recently there havent been many high-quality new releases to match their aesthetic one of the first was binh and onur zers album as treatment from last year others have appeared on labels like hardworksoftdrink time passages traffic and slow life but new music for the most part hasnt reached the lofty heights of this new wave of djing now that seems to be changing an italian formerly aligned with cadenza is one of the djs at the core of this emerging scene and his three-track frequency switch ep is another sign of change just like the dj sets by picone and his cohorts this 12-inch is ethereal pumping and weird matching snazzy drums with bleeps and strange noises you cant quite put your finger on sounds both fresh and retro capped off with strings and a humming bassline the more abstract b-side cuts and hit harder down low but they dont match the dreamy driving-with-the-top-down vibe of the a-side with a promising 12-inch from onur zer on the way expect more impressive retro-not-retro records to come
oh to have a digital rolodex like ot only can the man convince martin uttrich to help him out in the production arena but then he makes a few calls and we have a remix ep that features assy j neak luciano and mike uckaby a cross-section of producers that will have just about any fan of dance music raising their eyebrows in its general direction ( nd thats only part one ) s you might expect given the cast of characters the remixes vary wildly in tone but not much in quality assy turns in her inimitable hypnotic house take on that focuses heavily on a pulsing drone and assys voice while j neak allows to run wild in his of the 7 unham place favorite ts a prototypical remix for neak in fact each remix here sounds exactly as you might expect it to n neaks case that means a hicago house number that bumps with the best of em reveling in horn swells and a bassline that jazzes up things nicely luciano takes in a completely different direction adding analog synth squiggles ( ) and church bells ( ) to craft a thicketed minimal backdrop for s filthy monologue ( ts probably the weirdest musical backdrop for someone talking about plastic titties thats for sure ) mike uckaby meanwhile loops nd loops nd loops lack in the taking a few notes to their absolute maximum potential over the course of six-and-a-half minutes his is ucks bread-and-butter of course but it moves so little in this case that youre stuck thinking that oval has taken over production duties

theres a mystical aura that soaks through neil mcdonalds music from the alias to the pastoral colours and fantastical energy of his work named for the sometimes-ruler of scotlands picturesque western islands has an air of wonder that reflects the landscape its inspired by sweeping compositions bold arrangements and emotive melodies move with the grace of fog setting over a coastline these qualities come to the fore on debut album which explores the furthest reaches of his oeuvre from eight-minute acid tracks to striking vignettes mcdonald decorates his tracks with opulent colour and texture you could compare his approach to john talabot who crafts beats that make their home somewhere between a crowded dance floor and a bedroom that style is evident from the outset on which comes together slowly first a flowing cosmic synth a gentle pulse and then at the right moment a beautifully textured arp all underpinned by a hummable bassline its otherworldly and effortless like balearic music from outer space lands on the la label run by lovefingers who has a similar approach to the dance floor: rhythms arent always the centre of attention and sometimes they dont exist at all that feeling is underlined by the albums shorter more playful tracks like the bouncy the misty synth of and the beatless build of these tunes could work in a dj set but also stand on their own with loads of ambient detail only the piano-led feels like a mere interlude though it also highlights mcdonalds enviable grasp of melody in between those tidbits are the dynamic workouts mcdonald made his name on encompassing gentle funkiness ( ) bleep techno ( ) exoticism ( ) and full-throated prog house ( ) theyre almost all great but here sandwiched between more reflective passages they can feel shoehorned in or even too long length is the only real issue with at 78 minutes it demands a lot of attention if its an embarrassment of riches it can also feel unfocused which might come down to the albums origin lovefingers was apparently sent a trove of tracks from mcdonald and then pieced together an album out of them it makes for some odd sequencing such as putting the fast-paced at the end of the record ending on a cliffhanger rather than a resolved note deep and introspective as it is mcdonalds music seems perfect for the album format opening run from to the peaceful grooves of and is a beautifully unfurling triptych that later gets sideswiped by but mostly the tracklist is a mix of club cuts and ambient diversions an overwhelming package from a prolific producer that said mcdonalds continuous stream of music and his enviable hit rate are just part of the mystique hes cultivated over the years

maulins 2011 debut single deeper than the sun was a true child of the post-everything confusion from which it sprang its hyper-swung title track in particular borrowed from dubstep garage breakbeat and uk funky bundling them into a dizzying maximalist whole for a long while after it seemed like the london producer would fail to capitalise on his early promise but the past year has seen a renewed surge of activity with the launch of the tender hooks label which he co-runs and a pair of eps for japanese label the ep like its predecessor function open moves away from the uk funky-indebted warmth of that early single towards a steelier technoid sensibility maulins ear for a limber swing though remains intact as does his taste for muscular bass-led drops the title track keeps to a stolid 4/4 framework with dubby atmospherics and metallic synth work and are more thrilling each sporting gloopy basslines and the latter softened with a much-needed breath of detroit soul with the exception of the digi-only a comparatively straightforward techno-rave number these tracks are packed with details their endless layers of hi-hats swung auxiliary snares and fiddly synth parts filling every conceivable nook and cranny this can make for fatiguing listening but its difficult not to admire maulins ambition uk newcomer boxworks blawan-esque remix of is a timely reminder that inspiration trumps perspiration every time
dont let the title fool you: is no chill-out record title could just as easily be a reference to the background noise of londons club music scene an ever-mutating blend of techno house bass music and grime daniel timms is associated with an abstract grime sound linked to producers like strict face or iglew hes been spending more time in that scene launching a party called acid fantasy with akito and tsvi wallwork his third record for gobstopper centres around its built on a broken beat that sounds old but the globby bassline is pure uk wilfully obnoxious and all the better for it its among the more memorable bangers to come out of uk club music this autumn timms chases other muses on the rest of he touches on stomping house on and raw techno on both straightforward tunes that get their message across with shoulder-checking drum fills and basslines that leaves the brooding and the feel-good semi-ambient tunes with gorgeous flickers of melody is timms most varied ep yet showing that hes been soaking up more than instrumental grime

brightons may be small theyre yet to release half a dozen records but theyre consistently on-point with their take on deep house this is no small feat considering the volume of labels offering their interpretation of the in-vogue sound to an increasingly saturated market previously appearing on morris audio and deso damico has a history of crafting emotive and reassuringly assured house music soothingly raw and unfussy the title track glides classily along its bubbling lead refrain repeatedly making its point with the help of subtly swung hats and a cuddly bassline where patiently holds back confidently surges forward; sharper hats and the same tenderly drawn synths create another enchanting atmosphere that not even an oddly placed guitar can dispel with moodtrap contributing a more than worthy take on a pummelling bass synth scatters vocals and shards of the original in its wake this is probably the strongest release to date on an already excellent label
isnt a place for the usual greyscale deep techno over the past two years the low key label has set itself apart on the strength of just two releases which highlighted older quietly influential material and new work from contemporary talents with carefully cultivated approaches s third release a four track compilation ep called is its first serving of all new music with a focus on slower tempos the clued in producers featured here which includes rare appearances on wax more than deliver the goods swedes and set the bar high with their first (and hopefully not last) collaboration a laid back 4/4 cut with funky low end syncopations bubbelbad chugs through caverns of subaquatic reverb unhurriedly accumulating more percussive density along the way its wide open arrangement is as great for zoning out as it is for mixing s broken beat is a trip right from the start thanks to a long downward bass slide that undulates beneath all sorts of buzzes and chirps this singular production is enough to make you wish would put out more than a track or two per year following his dark and moody falcon on s previous release returns with a euphoric soundscape whose staccato analog melodies redolent of classic idm and ambient techno intertwine with the coiling textures that have long been the artists calling card its a breath of fresh air that echoes the explorative style of his cold radiance lp for field the most crucial draw on is the vinyl debut of natural/electronic system aka antonio giova and valerio gomez de ayala the italian duo explore hypnotic subtly psychedelic techno with their sets and shows they can also produce such sounds an exquisite dreamlike potpourri of winding bass syncopated drums melancholy pads and spacey bleeps the track tops off a gem of a release from
twelve years is a long time in anyones life but its an aeon in the cycle of techno its also the length of time since karl oconnor (regis) and peter sutton ) first released the untitled track that has become the subject of this double remix package oddly though the original version doesnt sound like it has aged too much underpinned by lithe breakbeats the tracks dubby textures create an atmospheric sense of melancholy thats reminiscent of rhythm sound as it progresses the track flirts with straighter more techno-friendly kicks which makes this listener question whether oconnor and sutton were way ahead of the pack or if the releases that inhabit the techno meets dubstep grey zone of recent years have been following in the footsteps of more visionary producers the remixes on this first record are more in keeping with the vibe on the original version than subsequent versions offer females own take is cloaked in deep chords and even when the dense off beats kick in it still sounds laidback kalon provides the other remix keeping both the rhythms and drums more stripped impressive though the remixes are the original 98 version still sounds the freshest on the second instalment of remixes we get a demo version of the original untitled track it may not have made the final cut but this alternate take is just as worthy with gloriously reflective dubby chords unfolding over a muted kick perhaps its not as forward-looking as the final version and may have fitted more with the prevailing late 90s winds but sutton and oconnors decision to forgo it in favour of a less immediate take shows again just how bloody-minded they are elsewhere the ch take is a sparse bleeping workout deadly effective in its construction and execution with broken beats morphing into straight kicks which are then augmented by a resonating acid bass silent s version is as just as utilitarian deploying a stabbing bass note and featuring dense almost claustrophobic beats accompanied by hissing percussion lapping up against them the remix highlight however goes to function although sumner has been busy doing reworks of luke slater and traversable wormhole he shows no sign yet of remix fatigue and this interpretation is arguably his finest to date: the typical function reverberating claps are present but there are also skeletal percussive clicks subtle filtering and most importantly a pulsating groove that makes this big room techno of the best kind
in an essay in the village voice 15 years ago simon reynolds poetically described proliferation and divergence of nascent post-rock genre away from rocks grand narrative into a delta of microcultures the same metaphor might be used nowadays to describe rapid evolution of dubstep after river banks were breached in first big wave from croydon and bristol dubstep has now spread into a myriad of imperceptibly subtle microgenres or tributaries saturating terrain between dub techno ambient and even itself the name dubstep is now almost a useless throwback to that first wave no longer useful for accurate orientation s is no exception to complications of classification you will find plenty of dubstep skank sub bass and a strong emphasis on third beat of every bar but re isnt really a straight-up dubstep track on album except for perhaps loafing tribalism of chillin and optimistic dawn of the majority of tunes are instead built like floating and twisting mobiles suspended from intricate percussive sculptures that at times emphasise kick drum techno-style or alternatively dig out bass and smear on hi-hats for a more rolling finish in end results are rarely easy to define perspectives and frantic sprawl of title track are two examples of more techno-driven sound but it is slipperiness of exceptions like which works big beats in a sparse vacuum flavoured with silvery techno chords that really stand out similarly best moments of album are often chimeras of drum bass and o r genres is sparse but it has gruff dogged persistence and veiled aggression of drum bass whereas heavy pressure of shines darkly over some classic bass warble too has moments and samples that hark back to golden era of genre but at same time is an unclassifiable hybrid is held toge r by s strong compositional sense he doesnt wear out his riffs keeping things fresh from beginning to end perhaps only minor criticism might be lack of deep head space to take away emphasis of beats the flow of is clearly built with dance floor dynamics in mind which dance floor is anybodys guess but since it works so well its hard to care what you might call it
if youre primary reference points for technoise are vatican shadow container and pete swanson then the dance pop comprising seasons of nudity will surely have you scratching your head in bewilderment this split 12 inch is without question one of the oddest releases the movement has yet to cough up: an audacious and at times perverse foray into mainstream club tropes that shares with noise music virtually nothing save a knack for radically upending listener expectation better of the two sides belongs to cofounded by jeremy harris (who under the moniker lazy magnet has explored everything from power electronics to basement techno) the new england duo specialize in homemade diva disco thats best described as chris bennett era munich machine filtered through the most saccharine song sweden has ever submitted to eurovision harris partner daryl seaver handles vocals and shes a real ice queen on the first of two tracks she soars with laser guided precision high above bombastic arppegios big room beats and a thick yet supple bassline s side in contrast is way more lo fi goofball and retro (which isnt a surprise considering the groups noise punk roots) all three songs are reminiscent of the cheesy synth pop heard on television cartoons and video games in the early 90s granted gizeldras possesses a geeky absurdity that will surely appeal to those out there who worship at the altar of sockeye ultimately though isnt doing a whole lot that proto technoise weirdoes extreme animals did with significantly greater degrees of verve and craft however demented

however distantly ambient music always seems intrinsically linked to nature an alternative soundtrack to the constant hum of our shared space so when lawerence english founder of the room40 imprint entitled his debut a japanese phrase for sound of fog it seemed like a sensible connection invoking a visual sensation that might easily translate into music combining field recordings from poland new zealand australia and japan with organ sounds analog filtering and harmonic drone sections english has created an album just as transporting as the fog- and oceanscapes hes exploring dense coils of distortion coalesce into diffuse light-streaked passages revealing undulations in balance that waver between eerie calm and new motion english creates a head space for the most foreign elements of the natural world embracing the kinetic surf and blow of mist while respecting its natural lethargy its willingness to shift and dip without overcoming its environment but english is rarely content with long gliding organ tones or the overwrought emotional aspects his subject might too easily evoke his compositions evolve in the unclockable time of the outdoors he keeps them in a constant flux that mirrors the unpredictable calms and clamors of his environment he depends on subtle countertextures to expose anything that glistens or reflects too much to the sandpapering of salt-air the uneasy textures of opener at break unexpectedly giving into the morning-after spell of with its caustic squalls of noise is sifted into the distant church-like tones of which achieves the lightless illumination feel of anything seen through a cloak of fog or mist lullaby is even murkier with its harmonic elements contrasted by a deep dim racket like something banging against sunken metal hidden beneath the sea ostensibly the subtlest piece here figures is busier beneath the surface than you first think twisting bristling noise into a repeating two-tone organ part until they both dissolve into s leaden drones as always with englishs work on though its structured to feel like its testing the limits of its own atmosphere without really moving lapping at the spots where the waters warmer the air more breathable
is the third in s de9 mix series (coming after decks efx 909 and de9: closer to the edit) and sees hawtin yet again attempting to push both the envelope of electronic music and the role of technology in creating such music transitions builds on the framework established by the earlier parts of the de9 series using the most advanced technology available to mix a number of sound sources decks efx 909 was built around drum machines and effects machines and real vinyl while de9: closer to the edit was built largely around tightly sampled loops technology has advanced considerably since closer to the edit and on transitions hawtin embraces the new technology using such tools as ableton live and digidesign protools to slice dice and dissect over a hundred tracks and then rebuild them into what are virtually entirely new compositions a bassline from here a drum kick from there and a melody from somewhere else at times sound sources from as many as seven different tracks are playing at the same time from a technical perspective it s a virtuoso performance to analyze dissect and reassemble so many sound sources so seamlessly (even with the help of ableton live) is mind-boggling in fact with so many arrangements on the part of hawtin is it accurate to call this a mix disc at all is it a transition from the work of a dj to a composer a transition from a traditional dj mix to something else entirely it is evident that hawtin seeks to ask these questions of his listeners almost confronting us with them at every given opportunity the first example of this hawtins choice to give his reassembled tracks new titles a bold move indeed one which may anger those who feel that hawtin cannot lay claim to an assemblage of sound sources created by other people yet what else could he call them track 1 with elements of plastikman stefan goldmann o sleeparchive false and ultrakurt is nowhere near as evocative as welcomm(in) the cover also addresses these issues with hawtin s face being made up of different track names used in the mix ; suggesting that the work before us is indeed made up of these different tracks yet have all come together under hawtin s guiding hand to make something totally new something more than the mere sum of its parts something that is utterly hawtin s vision (and in the end the cover is a vision of hawtin) is it accurate to call this a mix disc at all is it a transition from the work of a dj to a composer a transition from a traditional dj mix to something else entirely hawtin plays with the concept editing some sources down to a single note while others have familiar melodies left intact leaving listeners with an odd feeling of familiarity at various stages in the mix you ve most certainly heard many of these tracks before but never like this yet as the mix goes speeding along you ll find yourself saying things like hey isn t this carl craig as a familiar melody or bass line or drum kick goes speeding by (a game that is very easy to play with the dvd with names of the source tracks flashing onto the screen ) yes a dvd hawtin makes another transition here of a technical kind putting his 96-minute mix onto dvd so as to overcome the space limitations of a cd furthermore the dvd version presents hawtin with a chance to push the use of technology in music yet again coming in a 5 1 dolby surround sound mix hawtin has carefully arranged the mix to make full use of surround sound: this is the format he intends the mix to be heard in indeed this is the ultimate for techno-loving audiophiles however don t expect a visual extravaganza while listening to transitions a black screen confronts the viewer with the names of the source tracks flashing onto the screen as they are introduced into the mix only to literally fade back into blackness as they are mixed out again it s surprisingly interesting to watch as you have a very clear visual representation of what hawtin is mixing at any given moment in time (and can help you identify a drum kick or melody that suddenly comes in as the new name flashes onto the screen: the ultimate in techno trainspotting ) the dvd is not utterly bereft of visuals though (much to the chagrin of any uber-minimalists) short videos are included for two of the most striking passages of transitions we (all) search and the tunnel we (all) search is a short three and a half minute video using footage from andrei tarkovsky s stalker (of solaris fame) a boy in medieval peasant clothes sits at a table and moves three glasses telekinetically there is some very slight digital manipulation creating sudden time-lapse movements of the glasses that are in time with the backward snare hisses of the track the table vibrates as the tension in the track winds up and the visuals distort slightly as the camera suddenly zooms in on the boy s face before fading to black it s interesting although not compelling viewing and feels more like someone experimenting instead of a fully realized project (and hawtin says something to this effect in the mini-documentary) if we (all) search is an experiment the three-minute video for the tunnel is a more fully realized project the concept is deliberately similar: a white-clad hawtin sits at a white table in an entirely white room as various objects fade in and out of existence on the table and move around in time with the music hawtin observes impassively and eventually rests his head on the table just like the peasant boy in we (all) search unfortunately it comes across as a little too static and sterile and doesn t capture the sheer momentum and drive of the track itself although the visuals and the music match up in terms of timing there s something of a disconnect between them in terms of mood and energy there is also a 10-minute documentary on transitions where hawtin tells us his thoughts on the project and how much we re missing out on if we don t listen to it in 5 1 surround sound of most interest though is a 30-minute excerpt of hawtin doing a de9 performance live at the tdk timewarp event in germany it s interesting to watch hawtin at work especially as some of the tracks on transitions are performed in this live setting (it also seems to provide hard evidence that an attractive girl will always manage to make her way into the dj booth) this is a minimal mix proudly so designed to glide forward along straight lines with aerodynamic grace this is a sleek german sports car speeding along an autobahn through a dark rainy night hawtin however thankfully realizes that most of us don t own killer 5 1 surround sound stereo systems so the dvd version of transitions comes both in 5 1 and regular stereo of course some of us don t even own a dvd player a bonus cd includes a slightly edited 75-minute version of transitions (which come to face it is probably the one people will listen to most often due to the ease and relative convenience of the cd format) the urge to over-intellectualize and over-analyze hawtin s work is strong of course questions as to the role of the dj the role of technology in either aiding or detracting from the music and what that technology actually is and how it s used are all valid and need to be asked however an equally important question that is often lost in such intellectual investigations is this: what is the mix like with track titles such as subtracting reduction and master and minimission hawtin s agenda is obvious this is a minimal mix proudly so designed to glide forward along straight lines with aerodynamic grace this is a sleek german sports car speeding along an autobahn through a dark rainy night (track titles such as welcomm(in) seiltanzer tonarzt noch nah and weiter noch cannot help but summon up germanic imagery hawtin s recent transition to berlin appears to be influencing him ) we can t see what s outside of our vehicle s rain slicked windows; all we can see is a dark blur thanks to the high speeds we re moving at the feeling of movement of progression is constant throughout the mix except for a few notable landmarks the entire mix is a transition a series of transitions as we speed along hawtin s autobahn through the night never really at one place or another but always between making transitions most of the time it s impossible to point at anywhere on the map and say oh here we are the tracks just move by so fast (most being around three minutes long or shorter) that we barely notice them speeding by it s slick and sleek minimal and mechanical and stripped back visioning about 14 minutes into the mix is the first notable stretch on the highway that we come to all rolling drums and sudden snare hisses this leads us into we (all) search distinctive for its vocals and almost funky groove after then speeding along the straight lines of the autobahn for a while longer hawtin eventually sends us plunging through the tunnel an exhilarating 8-minute stretch where the sensation of speed picks up tremendously with a bleeping digital melody suggesting lights flashing past the windscreen as we move faster and faster a car chase perhaps it s undoubtedly the peak of the mix with bouncing metallic noises that keep skipping up and down the register building an incredible amount of tension the drums finally start really kicking at this point from this point we speed on with the drums continuing to kick nicely until we reach our final destination on the cd mix the chiming detroit (carl craig in fact) melodies of (d)ecaying beauty gently bringing us to rest it s quite a ride although those listeners who may want to stop and dawdle at points along the way may be somewhat disappointed transitions is most certainly not for those who like their mixes filled with explosive and notable moments on the dvd the nightdrive continues through some very nicely textured beats (the omnipresent wighnomy brothers working their way into the mix here) bringing us to the true finale transitions with the moody melancholic synths of latter-day plastikman accompanying the spoken word opening of the legendary underground resistance track transition it s a solemn even sobering ending as the synths die away and you are strongly advised to make your transition (it s also interesting that after all of the transitions hawtin has made both in his life and in this particular mix we end up ostensibly back in detroit ) it s quite a ride although those listeners who may want to stop and dawdle at points along the way may be somewhat disappointed transitions is most certainly not for those who like their mixes filled with explosive and notable moments there s very little to take note of along this minimal highway which is of course entirely the point it s not the destination that s important or even sightseeing along the way; it s the act of movement itself that s celebrated here for those who love a sleek journey in a sports car that has been built with technical flair hawtin s transitions is the highway to take

has released hardly any music of his own since his first album 2006s idiots re winning but he hasnt been a wallflower either besides continuing to pluck new talent for his label which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year he released one of the more deranged editions in the dj-kicks series with his 2010 entry of sun-blazed krautrock and pastoral electronica but still seven years since his last major body of work its safe to say that ears pricked up earlier this spring when word that emerged that he had a new album in the works nd what a return it is named after a novel by william golding quickly bewitches with an audio headspace thats very much holdens own if theres anything in his past that bears the sonic identifiers on display here its the wobbly analogue bliss-outs of his dj-kicks rather than the neo-trance at the heart of idiots or his famous break in clouds forged from single takes on his modular synth with no overdubs has the blurry delirious effect of an eighty-minute heatstroke holdens described some of the work here as a new kind of rave music one that alludes to ancient english historical practices like pagan rituals and theres certainly some kind of peculiar cosmic spiritualism linking these fifteen tracks holden has long been associated with various incarnations of trance and hes still after that state though he uses a different approach album is a collection of analogue workouts that buzz and heave through a vast spectrum of sounds which holden stitches together into a work of astonishing coherence just listen to the way etienne jaumets saxophone freakout at the end of caterpillars gives way to cathedral-like tones and scrapes of static on or how the ambient swirl of decays into the half-submerged cracklings of meanwhile is the sort of 3 m catatonia that might have graced an early nathan fake lp but sounds here like its been left to bake in the heat until its melodies seeped away title track takes these distorted blasts and elongates them into a kind of burnt techno that almost resembles fuck buttons ll of these tracks eventually build toward the cathartic galaxy sprawl of t eight-and-a-half-minutes long its by some stretch the records longest track; it also sounds most like what fans of break in the clouds might have thought holden would sound like come its peaceful and distantly serene but with flickers of dissonance rubbing away at the edges those contrasting textures are part of what makes perhaps the years most revealing and intriguing album yet

this colourful ep from rephlex alumnus ed upton as is the first vinyl release from a berlin label specialising in breakbeat-driven rave house and techno with its giant acid bassline and public enemy voice sample (chuck ds iconic hear the drummer get wicked line from welcome to terrordome ) the title track could almost be a slightly less terrifying cut from the early-00s oeuvre of hellfish and it succeeds on similarly no-nonsense terms after a loungey opening couple of minutes evocative of uptons more luxuriant outings as dmx krew takes an odd turn with a bizarre cheapo keyboard line upton is an experienced producer and presumably he meant it to sound this way but it feels jarring and plastic flip has better things in store with s twinkly cadences and s eastern-tinged analogue electro though neither threatens the title track as the records main attraction
change can be an important creative catalyst for any artist but seems to thrive on new horizons and unexplored potential its been two years since his last solo album the unintentional sea a meditation on how californias salton sea transformed the land and communities around it in the early 20th century and now nearly every aspect of his life is different once a staple of the seattle electronic and experimental music scene irisarri moved to upstate new york in may of 2014 and in the process lost all of his possessions (musical and otherwise) to car thieves it didnt take long for friends and fans to rally around the musician and his wife most notably raising over 18k to help rebuild his esteemed black knoll studio ; by january of this year irisarri began releasing new music will her heart burn anymore found its creator in a purge of emotion or perhaps more accurately aggression that hinged on heavily distorted textures and shadows you could call it a kind of rebirth for irisarris music and once burn came to its elegiac close the metamorphosis felt complete these are the circumstances from which emerges its all palpable in the six pieces irisarris solo work has always been deeply tenderly poignant but he finds more towering peaks and yawning chasms here were lead gently in with an exhausted sigh of soft-glowing harmony and distant static before starts its slow swell into tangled distortion and smothered sub frequencies guitars peek out at the end of after nine minutes of dense drone and their lightness feels like fresh air just before total suffocation this might be the darkest irisarri album yet but hes careful to hang a lamp in the corners is the biggest and brightest flame the stratospheric centerpiece is like a weighty m83 interlude where the themes are personal doubts and existential dread instead of teenage fantasy and poetic dream-speak a few minutes at the top of irisarri lets those troubles disappear hiatus gazes into the abyss and short as it is it feels like the dying black heart that feeds theres listlessness and depression in its four simple chords uncertainty and fear in its wavering top notes ambivalence in the thick encompassing fog the simplest expression of geography s palette closes the 40-minute record with processed piano supernatural ambience and cello its a downcast ending and seems to reveal a truth about irisarri: these problems personal or external are necessary to his creative process he seeks out turmoil and obstacles (i e the salton seas tragic story) unless they happen to find him first and from this stress he creates
s latest 12-inch follows two double eps but it comes packed with enough tonnage to nearly outweigh them thats mostly thanks to a track that finds the berlin producers golden ratio there are cloudy synths lurking in the background skippy drums locked in a free-flowing pattern and the occasional high-pitched bleep and then theres the bassline one of those magical melodies that keeps you glued to a minimal track its s most masterful yet wiggling up and down in a way thats bound to elicit freaky moves on a dance floor from the funky snare to the rattling hi-hats everything slots into place among its zigs and zags shrinks slightly in s shadow though its slinky drums are nearly as addictive especially when theyre padded by deep rumbles of sub-bass that leaves the 11-minute which taps into the deep hypnosis of s first 12-inch for perlon but with a perkier disposition and a ruder bassline both of these subtle and snappy tracks do what does best but takes it to another level

seattles label began business last year with a pair of 12-inches by detroits dijkhuis which variously referenced motifs as disparate as beatdown house and classic underground resistance for their third release they turn to italys lowlow a producer who has put his name to gems on millions of moments and mathematics in the past sometimes recording under the name soulomon is a suitable follow-up to those dijkhuis records sending familiar tropes in strange new directions the thudding is underlined by an arpeggiating clavinet line and wheezy synth tones it doesnt change much throughout its nine minute duration evidently more focused on sustaining disco house energy is a lot of pumping fun blending a ghetto house vocal exchange with submerged organ and strained strings its a little grittier than its predecessor but it has a similar strut the flip is considerably weirder particularly on where a sinister atmosphere is cultivated via a tense pattering rhythm and corrosive buzzsaw bursts finally pairs energetic synth squeals with circles of disorienting detuned keys landing somewhere between early bleep techno and recent narcotic house
time for the next installment of the fabric series this time brought to you from the boys from the west coast of the usa -e halo the lads seem to be very busy of late with their destination australia mix also in stores as well as taking the time to answer some of the questions put to them in the producer playpen this of course bundled with the fact that they are big draw cards in dance parties all over the world and you can see that -e halo are busy and popular artists our attention is turned to fabric 07 and to put it simply it is a very strong release swag s dub of nile s 3 in the morning is an early highlight with its soulful drums and delicate sampled vocals i m satisfied by scoper and bubba adds a funky retro element early in the mix while doza s dub of hanna s time keeps the summer vibe rolling along with minimal vocals and subtle floating strings guided methods rugburns uses a bouncing baseline and minimal piano a lovely record the dub of midnight by solaris heights has another retro vibe to it with the disco sounds and vocals the mix concludes with the very excellent baselines of fluid system by ernest saint laurent overall a very good mix especially for the australian summer which is upon us very much a deep house soundtrack for the summer vibe and a welcome mix for fans of -e and halo
who would have thought a double cd that comprises nothing but remixes could be this good but when you see that the remixes are all the work of mathew herbert you should have no doubt in the quality his vision in remixing is 100 innovational and 101 inspirational not content with housing a track up or chilling out your favourite club classic herbert tears the original song up into the tiny sound pieces then sticks it back together in a jigsaw like fashion creating brilliant syncopated beats thick warm bass movements with cool jazz inflicted vocals not to mention the outstanding keys often resulting in a track that is so far removed from the original that you are struggling to see how the original artist still has credit on the record sleeve guy has a talent that most producers can only dream of original artists range from the 1960s jewish french jazz pop artist serge gainsbourg (charles webster s brilliantly produced soulful house project) san francisco based vocalist planet e s detroit tech jazz master through to the much heard of only reason i give this a nine rather than ten is because with musicians like herbert out there you never know when something better may come along

are a breakbeat outfit who ve been producing music for over 7 years and have performed live pa s all over ireland underground breaks labels such as sinister recordings and sound of habib have released previous tunes and both knees b/w glitterati is their first release on their own musicdownstairs label side a both knees both knees cheekily samples the lyrics from a hip hop tune and keeps them on repeat so the listener won t forget about them (hint hint ) jump up breaks with a clever use of percussion - lots of bongos to get the dancers on the floor towards the middle the vocal sample gets passed through a vocoder to give it a nice filtered feel while stirring synth lines give the tune a little melody towards the end the tune climaxes with lots of siren effects and the vocal sample is chopped up for different effects side aa glitterati glitterati is a swing-stepping tech stomper which should be enough to confuse dancers on the floor the beat has a nice shuffle to it while a hard melodic bassline and a ragga vocal sample keep the vibe peaking it s a pity the tune is so short and ends on a progressive anti-climax
when was putting the finishing touches to his latest ep id like to think he named its three tracks with an old ( and improbably popular ) british ad for wood stain in mind the appeal to directness in the ads strapline it does exactly what it says on the tin is embodied by and a pair of intense heads-down dance floor tracks same goes for a dishevelled thrum meant to evoke the curtains-drawn vibe of an afters s direct approach is a lot of fun s descending shepard tones are met by a whistle it might make you think of drop it like its hot sliding the other way its brought to a boil by up-pitched tonal layers which makes for a heady peak-time rush contains a similarly high-pressure atmosphere though im not as convinced by the execution the lack of space can feel suffocating the dominant pitter-patter drums sound squashed and theres not much space left for s interesting array of one-shots and accents we decompress with a grotty downtempo cut where low-key melodies play over what sounds like snorting

isnt liking philadelphia ternational however rejiggered kind of a no brainer like enjoying a spoonful of the melted ice cream pooled at the bottom of a bowl s ice cream for ds sake nd its philadelphia ternational discos greatest label its motown with huge pop and r b hits that defined the 70s mainstream and as djs never stop discovering an equal supply of tucked away gems like motown philadelphia ternational was a bellwether for social consciousness and back straight anthems its lush ballads and instant funk ( stant funk for the record recorded for salsoul k philadelphia ternational ii: s boogaloo ) nd while house fans have been well familiar with disco loops as far back as the mid 90s (cf johnsons 994 welcome to the warehouse ) the structural tightening and scene building aspects of edits culture is a different thing altogether and well suited to writer producer executive powerhouses kenneth and leon huffs (and arranger producer compatriot thom lls) blend of highfalutin strings and ever earthier motion s also where the depth of philadelphia ternationals catalog comes in handy with songs as familiar as many of the ojays and and the hits were then and now its harder to hear them as new or to want to can be done as anyone familiar with dimitri from pariss volcanic reconstruction of and the i lost the original is so perfect that id never imagined anyone could touch it and not ruin it by contrast the ultra familiar items included on are largely playful tim s changes the for from a ballad to a floor filler bolstered by a surprisingly well placed kick drum and extra percussion highlights when teddy pendergrass stops talking and starts singing odlemans new version of s int stoppin w (from 979 at the tail end of phillys black music dominance) adds some filtering and either highlights or adds on a high xylophonish part that dominates the mix makes an rthur russell record out of one that went pop as neat an encapsulation of 0s kids attitude toward disco as any todd tejres version of s lopes in precisely the way youd expect it to so yeah its hard to fuck up material this proven sets the stage for philadelphia ternationals 40 year celebration: tom moulton remixes compilation and a few other goodies are in the works ll of it is laudable said maybe we could stand not to have so many re edits for a while yes i realize its not a novelty anymore its a full blown genre but as deeply as i bowed when i saw earl ngs drums at seattles experience project during its disco exhibit a decade back im starting to wonder how far my waist is going to bend when i see a serato loaded laptop (or whatever) sitting behind glass awaiting our delectation in the future
a new label by milo smee (aka bintus) and thomas franklin inversions has launched with an eclectic five track compilation by starts with a synth line like a frantic polygraph needle focused rhythm and organic drum textures bring to mind nisennenmondai and elektro guzzi even moreso when the song switches to an acoustic drum kit and brings in some wailing guitar from then on pulls back the mask its been wearing this is a rock record more or less gilded with electronics s sounds like a hardcore bands rehearsal sabotaged by unhinged organ notes rest of the ep is more sincere but no less fun in its disjointed presentation of smee and franklins taste for 70s and 80s fusion s im is bluesy psych rock with gentle shakers and hand drums res a campfire intimacy to the song helped by simon hughes vocal arcs making it one of the eps most likeable contributions as smee and franklin nod to synth pioneer jean michel jarre on their synth led rock funk jam angular guitar licks whip against atmospheric swells idea of a techno label is inversions parent label fostering something as rock centric as is a bit of a laugh spacey drone metal of apoth ose s unspools in horizon spanning distortion huge cymbal splashes and snare rolls but its epic gestures are enjoyable because unlike some of the music references they dont take themselves too seriously
few could predict what telefon tel avivs josh eustis and belongs turk dietrich would sound like when they linked up as for a self-titled lp in 2016 the album recalled a beloved strand of dm pioneered by the likes of autechre and mark fell which is the aesthetic the duo further explore on s two original productions which range from s techno complexity to s pointillist stutter with a lovely harmonic richness recalls snd eustis and dietrich take the sound and repurpose it with a drone and bassline also features well-selected remixes that intensify the release rather than seeming like afterthoughts jlins judicious footwork touch is restrained but full of vibes bringing out an energetic trance in a track taken from s upcoming second album which is due out later this year fluxion the greek producer hailed for his chain reaction singles in the late 90s emphasizes the dreamy dub that lies beneath s surface less apparent in s originals but there nonetheless
gobstoppers latest continues the labels winning streak with yet another grime related gem that manages to be both weird and infectiously pop this time the producer is new london talent who displays contrasting sides of his personality is a cute construction of chipmunk vocals spry midi strings and cartoonish fx rendering grimes rhythmic chassis as fun and colourful as a fisher price toy its fracturing of pop forms calls to mind fellow young gun finn though swaps the adult eroticism of keep calling for something pg friendly on the flipside excitable bassline mutant appears to be completely different at first listen closer though and youll find the same toy like quality to its thin farty bassline and hyperactive drums half of s ample talent lies in making his beats sound so playful; the other half in making them kick hard regardless
in detroit theres a well-established crossover between hip-hop and house for instance andr s the former slum village dj is just as likely to bang out hip-hop beats on his mpc as he is timeless house tunes other artists like waajeed and nick speed also blur the lines between the two genres black noi es first house 12-inch is another iteration of this mostly known for sample-based hip-hop beats honoring dillas legacy hes previously collaborated with danny browns go-to producer skywlkr black noi e real name rob mansel is of a new musically omnivorous generation i used to sit on forums and message boards and just download everything there was to download all genres he told the hundreds mansel also plays bass in a hardcore band has djd for m i a and studies grime alongside rap mansels self-titled debut for vanity press is a bold take on his home towns house legacy mansels work flitters between dusty soul samples and more aggressive sounds both sides are on display on here the opening track sounds like an updated version of theo parrish at his most paranoid a minor-key piano chord holds things down while a wonky mid-range bassline and noisy leads set an ominous tone is a feel-good skating rink jam whose strings and loping bassline feel like a tribute to andr s the closer runs with that same sped-up soul feeling but this time with percussion thats somewhere between motor city electro and hessle audio-style nuance like his forbears mansel grew up listening to detroit radio steeped in the citys music culture it laid the groundwork for black noi e s modern approach
usually the breakdown of a house record is there as a respite from the main action of the tune it allows the dancers to catch their breath throw their hands in the air and wave them like they just dont care et al and the dj to play with the eq and/or cue up the next banger s original works a little differently naples producer giuspeppe morabitos new single for (his second the first was mind games five years ago) is a hard latin stomp driven by a left-handed piano rumble and splashed with right-handed grace notes but its at the points when the drums drop out briefly near the 2 5-minute mark for a full minute and a quarter at 4:18 when the track shows its balearic heart not least thanks to morabito setting those piano notes to reverse right before the beat reasserts itself snoretexs remix goes the other direction kicking off with aggressively treated piano notes before settling into a broken-bassline thump with s high-pitched keyboard turned icy and remote flowers and rework though amplifies the very thing that makes the original memorable the breakdown they take at its word turning it into dawn-over-the-horizon ambient that would have been right at home on last years matthew hawtin mix its not explicitly retro though just innocent without being stupid in a way thats rare at any time
when it celebrates its tenth birthday next year can look back on a job well done (so far) for a little house label from a corner of northern england midway between manchester and leeds theyve over achieved when it comes to attracting talent ron curtis rick wade mihai popoviciu and brett johnson have all passed through and there are producers who owe a debt of gratitude for their break from the opposite end of that spectrum comes chicago house doyen chez damier here joining label co-founder eddie leader and tomson whos best known for his work on freerange damiers soulful croon is pushed high up in the mix on the main version of leader and tomson prove able musical foils serving up a warm wandering bassline stabbing synths and plenty of old-fashioned chicago soul they toughen up the beats on the dub introducing a whip-cracking percussive element
a collaboration between nick hook and ian widgery are up next on the imprint with the nick hook remix is first up and it sets the release up nicely with some smooth house music thanks to a nice flowing loop set up by a nice lively baseline and vocal effects that are worked nicely into the flow some stabbing synths come into the track in the 2nd half and i am not entirely convinced they are needed even though they do add something to the track the original mix follows and it is certainly a unique production thanks to some very creative drum patterns and intriguing baseline growls i really do like this mix as it is not often you hear tracks that try to do something a little different and it really does work as it gets quite sinister and evil in the latter half a nice release here and i do encourage you to check out the original mix it may be a little too tough for some but it certainly is innovative
sometimes every year a record comes along where the hype is so ridiculously high that the track is already massive before it even gets a release one of those track this year is by the very talented aussie duo of luke chable danny bonnici caned by sasha pete tong james zabiela and nick warren in particular is one of those big tunes that you just can t ignore made in a few hours by the duo the track demonstrates that a simple formula can often do the trick so much so that it has been included in sander klenienberg s latest renaissance mix as well as the playlists in many sets of the big name dj s as mentioned the original mix starts off innocently enough with some nice drum work and clattering effects before it breaks down early and introduces the main bubbly melody that rides over a smooth baseline the melody gains an effected partner shortly before the production erupts with the baseline working its way into the track in no uncertain terms the track flows smoothly until it breaks down again showcasing the melody once more before the track hits peak time madness for the remainder definitely a summer track this production is purely designed for the dance floor and in that respect it works brilliantly the have a break mix is on the flip and it sees a few changes from the original the 4/4 beat pattern is exchanged for a break beat the track has a similar arrangement but noticeable changes and effects are applied to the main melody as it becomes more disjointed to pretty good results it s a little quirky but it retains the big room baseline and summer vibes this is a pretty big release for and fair play to them for getting it released as soon as they possibly could the original does the damage as many would know and the reworking on the flip adds a little bonus to a release that would have been adequate as a one-sider check it out and see what the fuss is all about
the crew behind dresden label uncanny valley has musical interests extending well beyond straightforward club tracks youll find flecks of disco and hip-hop splattered across their 30-odd releases and shtum said to be their techno sub-label is hardly in the business of releasing obvious bangers so its no surprise that their rat life offshoot whose insignia features the motto tools for the working dj released an excellent post-punk ep it would almost be weirder if they didnt looks to be only release so far and other than the fact that the band is from sweden and the material on this ep dates from 2008 to 2013 information is scarce whats abundant however is the nuance they wring from the vintage template the title cut pits nervous atmospheric drumming against a growl of synth bass shimmering guitar chords and vocals that sound bored by their own brattiness the combination would verge on pastiche if it werent so incisive on the band burrows deeper into this ruminative vibe with bass and guitar lines walking circles around each other if the a-side to borrow some rock critic nomenclature is angular then the flip is its jangly counterpart at least at first features guitar work plucked from orange juice a bright spot in an otherwise moody brittle arrangement for its final act the ep swerves into oblivion on a bleak ambient composition where now-familiar vocals reduce to a low moan smoke and ruins dust and ashes goes a line from and its a pretty good description of where ends up
simon aussel is finding his voice after donning the alias his debut release the cellar door / piste jaune 2-inch for s reverse label found the young frenchman working confidently with a familiar strain of stark sleek uk techno the i m o ep followed a few months later tapping into a slightly brighter sound full of synthy atmosphere is aussels first solo record since and his first for proper these four tracks feel like the culmination of the work on his first two records and yet they sound little like what hes done before the drums distorted veneer on and to the tiny rhythmic intricacies throughout to the weightless sway of this is aussels most inventive record yet whats most striking about however is the range aussel finds within the sound hes developing with its taut percussive energy objekt-esque soundscapes and depth-charge bass drops is the clear banger of the bunch but that doesnt mean it overshadows the abstract ebb and flow in the halftime swagger and trippy textural fx that move seem inspired as much by techno as recent tangents of experimental drum bass while works out some jazzy drum patterns with a crunchy sound palette that wouldve fit nicely on kowtons utitlity if the apple doesnt fall far from the tree at least aussel is smart enough to carve it into his own shape
always finds peter kersten inclining toward the cold washed surface of a stony smooth dancefloor and is no exception the ep contains three squares all comprised of signature blue synth washes low basslines that never wander far from your feet neoclassicist drum patterns (hence the neo detroit appellation hardwax prefers) and repeated motifs based on simple rising/falling melodies played with clipped peals of bells xylophones and chimes being formulaic music the success of a track relies on two things: the inherent quality of the weave and those moments where he hits on a stellar motif such as on the superb faces from sender s receiving data comp or back four from the eccentric ep released on dial in 00 for me although all of the tracks on are made out of typically -quality material two out of three fail to find that magical motif: only the third square (with a wobbling rising melodic line) comes close to former bests is a formula with a groove worn deep into it and it s not s best but as many a fan will tell you kersten s second best is still streets and swoons ahead of most where does that leave us i listen to this i like it and i recommend it to you along with everything kersten does but am i the only one who keeps wondering when kersten is going to completely reinvent his sound as he did so successfully after the slew of releases clustering around the debut lawrence album i love the patterns but maybe it s time for some new ones for some thinking beyond the squares in any case offers a nice way to while away the meantime
when starts you have no idea where its going to go the mellow bassline and eighth note hi-hat pattern betray no particular genre then we get a steam whistle a lazy drum fill and when the beat drops its hip-hop something like it anyway its a boom-bap that would go nicely with rhymes from someone like sensational roughly speaking the second -inch from svn and porn sword tobacco does for downtempo what - 4 did for house and techno: strips it down and spaces it out until its almost unrecognizable theyve also thrown in a thumping club track for good measure if the rhythms are unexpected the overall sound is classic pst and svn youve got the drums earthy and unpolished and then all the stuff floating around them odd frequencies that swarm the beats like tiny insects loose and imperfect as they sound the rhythms are artfully constructed head-nodding is unavoidable the with its winding lead melody is the more fleshed out of the two but something about the more subtle more alien gives it the edge for me the house track on the b-side mixes things up nicely its tinny breaks smudged kicks and squiggly bassline floating in the same odd flotsam as the other two (and for that matter most of svns productions) listen closely and its translucent layers seem to go on forever
s nascent production career is inextricably linked with marcel dettmann who opened fabric 77 with the up-and-comers debut track and later released it as part of a vinyl set of exclusives from that mix and now hes given ford his first solo ep youll hear immediately what dettmann likes about this guy his productions are tense and atmospheric but also punchy and light on their feet perfect for setting a dark mood without bogging things down if arthure iccon the kick-free fabric 77 cut is a prototypical dettmann set opener then s first track would carry the dj perfectly into the mid-set stretch its diamond-tipped drums chiseling into grand chords with deadly precision the eps last track scrapes forward on live hi-hats and unfurling ambience feeling like the moment some six or seven hours in when dettmann gives the dance floor over to pure insanity every dj with a label will put out tracks theyd want to play but fords fit dettmann like a glove ford has certainly found his context but is also a document of him finding his voice besieged by helicopter blades and rhythmic thunder is full of great sound design but without a compelling composition to adhere to its directionless similarly is a smart bassline in desperate need of a track to play beneath in the midst of all this searching though ford hits on something that feels like its all his a brute-force techno track infiltrated by idm atmospherics mixes the eps wispiest melodies with its heaviest drums you sense its here that dettmann heard not just a fellow traveler but a talent in his own right

s sound has always been difficult to parse sure you can pick out the influences classic grime early jungle ardkore but the way he collapses them into hermetically sealed boxes is disarmingly oblique last year has seen him strip his music almost uncomfortably bare culminating in gonna work out fine one of the most clinical and challenging things to ever come out of uk bass music maybe hes gotten it out of his system then his first release for r s fitting well into a continuing line of colourful releases for the label sounds positively maximal next to something like fine if his memorable twitter links to classic plates on youtube werent enough to tell you jack dunning likes jungle and is possibly his most transparent paean yet first thing thats apparent is the rumbling queasy sub-bass: breathy hats and anxious snares clamor before the songs main melody drops over gut-punching kicks litany of simultaneous ascending melodies buzz and hiss like an angry hornets nest the panicked motion of someone desperately swinging at a particularly nimble flying insect its oddly sublime overwhelming as the song takes on a life of its own feeding on its own infinite energy in the most junglist of ways of the is the exhausted aftermath of played in reverse: the melody stumbles down a steep staircase too fatigued to muster up the same kind of awe-inspiring strength track is occasionally buoyed by a monotone piano that detachedly rings out like it did in palamino only now its treading in a pool of reverb much like the rest of this ep his tracks are no longer dry skeletons but breathing quivering creatures and theres just as much to love in their newfound health as there was in their former austerity
this is s first release of and according to the press release its the first product of a newly revamped studio whatever he did to soup it up his sound does seem slightly beefier here it fizzes less around the edges; the drums have more bite and the low-end wallops harder thats especially true on with its broad boomy kick and relentless snare and tom tattoos ased on a cycling three-chord riff it displays a similar pent-up energy to that of his labelmate made up sound save perhaps the latters tumbling polyrhythms keeps his drums on a tight leash as he careens from crescendo to crescendo is softer suffused with bells and those misty chords that characterized his rush hour releases even when he heaps on the delay though sounds more focused than his housey forays of a few years ago building up billowing clouds of tone and then plowing through them with jackhammer 909 snares eneath its restrained veneer it kicks and thrashes
is a young london sound artist who makes collages from samples and loops pasting jagged fragments in seemingly random patterns her work isnt tied to any genre taking musical elements vocal hooks piano drum sounds and making sometimes unmusical pieces with them her two self-released albums from last year were striking in their abstraction funnelling r b hip-hop and gospel into an avant-garde style of songwriting on her debut for pushes her music even further into the deep end its among the uk labels most dumbfounding records is a 25-minute ep but its built like an album it starts with the sounds of in a room with her collaborators they happily chat away until the voices and piano begin to stutter as if the ep were descending into madness much of is just s voice and piano but she makes that combination sound alien is a poignant musical phrase cut into angular pieces looping until it forms an anxious rhythm creates chaos from the sparest of musical arrangements the ep only gets more unhinged from there climaxing with a foo fighters-sampling track called where guitar strums clash with scuffed breakbeats and soulful vocal phrases catchy vocal loops are littered throughout the ep like beacons of light catches the ear with wordless almost inhuman fragments recalling burial in the way she taps into a well of feeling that goes beyond words even at its weirdest its deeply affecting music and by combining that with breaks on tracks like and she dives into the uk hardcore continuum that often focusses on making original music out of otherwise rinsed elements the way references pop culture yet keeps her listener at a distance could remind listeners of dean blunt whose work is also a splattered collage but even on a label like s work exists entirely on its own terms its a vocalist and her piano presenting a form of singer-songwriter music that doesnt need words to get its feelings across
last year william released a concept album titled horror while it didnt exactly go down as one of 2009s game-changing lps it did introduce a whole lot of people to the sound: thick and unpredictable basslines and adventurous melodious sampling prior to that though several of nu discos forerunning tastemakers had taken notice mike simonetti of italians do it etter was one of them he put out no static at the beginning of 2009 a track that nicely epitomized the sound scracy sees the sweeping pads and analogue squelch that characterised s 2009 lp horror and no static in particular return to the fold it seems that the italians fondness for filters 909s and creeping melodies hasnt subsided in the slightest but the track nonetheless stands as a healthy addition to the catalogue on the -side djs have seven minutes of straightforward kick to work with on ugust unlike the rest of s work though its hard to imagine disco jocks giving this a second spin; at close to 130 pm its a marked departure from his standard mid-tempo territory
the last release from junes girl shake ep marked him out as the most introverted member of south londons her collective even where night slugs-style percussion came into play as in the title track it was offset by solemn synth work borrowed from darkstar circa north the results werent hugely arresting but as is the case with her cohorts miss modular and sudanim who have both turned out storming eps in recent months appears to have entered with fresh purpose is a deconstructed techno banger all grandiose horns and lacerating claps in other words about as far from navel-gazing as you can get as with his labelmates the tightly reverbed percussion fractured chords and jersey-ish kick patterns owe a debt to night slugs but its widescreen audacity is s alone try riding out that pumped-up breakdown without getting tingles is a scattier beast the scraps of melodic matter terse synth arps a la jam city snippets of glossy vocal take a while to settle into a hook and when they do the effect isnt quite as rousing as the a still the controlled chaos of the thing is entertainment enough
re are few producers who have as diverse a back catalogue as his debut full-length for german imprint his ninth album in total is first album however to rein in genre-hopping to concentrate on simply making a collection of quality tech house instrumentals t times coming across as a love letter to detroit slick beats syn sized emotion of intro could be a long lost b-sides on et e before becoming repetitive though he turns to sheffield for which is underpinned by luscious o rworldly melodies almost utechre-like in ir construction t certain points threatens to be more fill than thrill; me er on pleasantly without achieving much; at first beats trudge basslines labour but tejadas mastery soon becomes apparent as he tears techno murk apart with riffs of sheer joy its an unexpected turn to each tune but its also something thats to be expected from this veteran he knows just as well as you do when things are starting to lag indeed he probably knows better whereas tejadas previous dance floor-orientated albums may have had a tendency to come across as a collection of tracks presented as an album ra r than a long playing concern that actually flows is opposite its an album of impressive scope intricate detail one that proves that this california producer almost two decades into his career has plenty left to say
dusk blackdowns keysound label has released some great music in the last few years but its only now that it seems to be establishing a completely distinct niche for itself fueled largely by the duos search for music to play on their monthly rinse fm shows just-released compilation this is how we roll tapped into an impressive seam of 130 bpm music from both hitherto unknown names and burgeoning artists such as beneath and while varied in approach all seem to share a desire to return to that moment in around 2008 where the emergence of funky was having powerful effects on dubstep and grime generating rhythmically inventive dark and distinctly uk-flavoured forms rather than staying focused on the tropes of grime or dubstep the genres most of these producers grew up with the four tracks on draw from styles throughout the uks rave continuum so s a brusque slice of darkside two-step drags hardcores drugged-up diva voices and the whiplash basslines of drum bass into its orbit s scatta is very much a jungle flavoured concoction all pulsating sub-bass and shattered breaks that ricochet around the mix s riffs on eskibeat: its frostily translucent basslines are pure wiley with heavily delayed snares thwacking like helicopter rotors while clouds of vapour rise up through the mix s touches on the romantic melodies of sinogrime its diffuse frame seemingly woven from tiny shards of brightly coloured glass
ok just so were clear the refrain of the track is hey horseteeth girl i want to make you make horsey noises so basically can do whatever he wants with this and its the best song ive heard all year true story: i joined an online dating site and my roommate and i have opposite girl taste he likes these roundfaced roly-poly girls and i like long faced (as he calls them) ponies so this song is basically my anthem i love me a horseteeth girl sonically the title track is what youd expect from the v s woozy detuned synths kitchen-sink percussion and the sort of charismatic creepiness you expect from a game show host on mescaline the hardcore breaks of detrimentalist are still buried in there but theyve become a badge of snark not badassness the unimpeachably titled meanwhile is a trip through circus glitch and d b with lost-child vocal samples rubbery arpeggio-clash gymnastics and all the drums in the whole loop folder at once i mean dont get me wrong this record is effing unlistenable but the song titles onward probably gets the closest to conventional listenability with a searching filtered keyboard and a four-to-the-floor tempo but lest you thought this was something normal v s s aaron funk starts making a pig-snort sound over aphex-style scatterdrums if you havent quit by now youre onboard for life we finish up with remix a slower more 8-bit ghostly version of the eponymous cut snares and kicks turned up to 11 with a funny little vocoder vacation in the middle the horseteeth girl part keeps getting looped with a new vocal treatment each time the gimmick wears thin but the lols kind of sustain it i mean it is only a four-tracker right and we end with a sample that goes ive made you a drawing of a giraffe fucking an elephant notice how his mustache looks just like mine you bet
i wouldnt recommend listening to at home it may simply come off as a cheesy coltrane-sampling tune with a weird breakdown that doesnt quite work if you can swing it id check it out at a club where its a cheesy coltrane-sampling tune with a weird breakdown that doesnt quite work trust me the difference in context is enormous seeing dancers trying to find the beat during s unveiling of its original source material is a sight to behold funny sure endearing more so that first moment of recognition when the oyz let coltrane play his unadorned skanking tune is a revelation of sorts (the reaction that i saw on the dancefloor was something along the lines of fool me once shame on me ut bring it back and ill show you that im ready for it the teases never do ) everyone is in the same boat wondering what the hell just happened what just happened is a novelty of sorts surely in many ways what the are doing here and did with viktor casanova and zinga is an bletonization of fantastic source material they stick a kick drum underneath another persons work and make it their own ut id argue that interventions like these especially on the dancefloors that the are heard on are more important than the way in which they were produced introducing signs of life and humor into a relentless single-minded arena can only be a good thing seeing confused clubbers is always a good thing s for the difference between the two the party swing mix is basically a shortened edit of mucho lungo so it simply depends on how long you want to go before unleashing that breakdown my view: the longer the better

in a twitter conversation last week erol alkan chris duckenfeld luke from the unabombers and others lamented the increasing conservatism in the cosmic/balearic-influenced disco scene; london dj frank e chimed in to assert all dance music sub cultures are most vibrant before theyre codified and start having records made for them hes probably right but very few individuals get to enjoy that long view in person stuck with the historical and geographical hands were dealt most of us in dance music spend most of our time with genres that have long since settled into their standard forms by sydneys is definitely a codified version of balearic disco virtually every element here feels like it might have come from some master checklist: ropy electric bass rolling bongos string vamps squelchy arpeggios distant vox rhodes chords moog solo even searing electric guitar solo (like dj harvey or prins thomas they like their disco with a heavy helping of rock ) for a form that once professed to travel the outer limits its not terribly outre but if youre predisposed to nu-disco pastiche thats not necessarily a problem the production is luscious and theres a wealth of musical ideas in the tracks many twists and turns (its certainly not a track for djs who prefer linear controlled grooves ) on their acid re-rub of the cut they add throbbing overdriven 303s and 909s elements of a different code entirely which contrast invigoratingly with the blissful keys and strings fresh off a recent ep for delusions of grandeur tornado digs in with slow-motion gusto this kind of pitched-down house music is quickly evolving its own standards but that doesnt make s version any less effective reducing the original to a single bassline and a spacious drum groove he lavishes his attention on dubbed-out production and flashes of keys and he even manages to preserve a portion of the guitar solo while keeping the vibe tightly controlled las woolfy and stray further from the source; their remix is also a downbeat house bubbler around 115 bpm but it sounds like theyve mostly written new synth parts around the structure of the original towards the end they even add breathy falsetto vocals a decidedly yacht rock touch for the keepers of the codebooks for the rest of us its just blissfully breezy
seems its all about hamburg on the latest from um hamburg-based local boys matthias meyer and stimming are front and back respectively on the latest 12-inch frankly this is just the opposite of how it should be meyer is by no means a bad producer so far he seems to have limited himself to releases on liebe* and that he avoids sounding overmatched on such a consistently strong label speaks volumes ut for someone who produces so slickly much of meyers output has oddly lacked character is no different percussive tech-house groove isnt the most surprising thing to be releasing in and a single word vocal repeating house doesnt sauce things up much is playable and tracky and though these adjectives can sometimes slander deadly good but unostentatious tracks they here form code for something you might hear played plenty but will forget quickly meyer is obviously talented but he could do with putting a bit more of himself into his records stimming has little problem with putting himself into his records and nger is true to form its a riveting quasi-spooky techno number with as you might expect from the diynamic-affiliated artist some surprising but devastating string chords while nger is very playable too youd know exactly who made it on hearing it out that coupled with production thats just as impeccable as meyers makes this tune another kettle of fish entirely its clear that stimming knows his voice and nger certainly leaves me very keen to hear what hes got to say next
we play a sterling young label from belgium that is the making of veteran j red specialize in crisp deep house grooves that emphasize immaculate production; no bells whistles or roaring ableton riffs just taut syncopated rhythm only two releases old the imprint is forging a wide fan base of discerning selectors due in no small part to its sound sitting as comfortably in a ben watt la terraza set as an efdemin marathon at panorama bar producer was at the helm for the labels first release and he returns here with four tracks of abyss-deep groove-laden house that touches disco-fied etroit jack and dub-inflicted tech a twinkling house number in no hurry to unveil its melancholic undertones begins things and is all swinging handclap-heavy percussion until it gently opens up to starry-night synths that send shivers in abundance red s liquid tech house remix of meanwhile cuts a low-slung acid growl that pushes s puffed up dont go there girl diva strut into darker corners is my pick of the litter; a simple two-chord dub house number wound tight with machine gun percussion and vintage claps its drenched in smart chicago soul that gives a knowing nod to early larry heard while the slow wrecking ball disco of jumpin has got the freerange crew talking (it was played on their recent podcast) its creeping bassline and minimal melody make it perfect early set fodder for those inclined to that sound
tobias freund might be berlins most versatile electronic artist on the one hand hes got timeless club jams like 2006s street knowledge ; on the other ultra-subtle ambience like non standard institute plays non standards his first album with max loderbauer as nsi he sounds equally confident doing both but his most inspired music falls somewhere in the middle unbound by the functionality of techno but teeming with its energy and atmosphere on his albums for hes offset the freeform stuff with straight club tracks on he serves it neat each track here has its own distinctive groove at tempos ranging from 80 to 75 bpm but all of them evoke a kind of frothy swirling motion on percussion drifts through the stereo field like debris though a storm panning heavily over windy drones the next three tracks send different rhythms through the same gusty landscape: a fiercely strobing drum pattern on a weightless pulse on and a slo-mo chug on the only track with a linear backbeat (albeit at 84 bpm) intentionally or not the absence of a standard banger seems to make a point: non standard productions like these need not be relegated to the of a club record they do just fine on their own
two of ibizas biggest 2009 success stories coming together for a single in the middle of may is what synergy sounds like you cant blame cocoon or both parties stand to gain if audiences warm up to this one-sided 12-inch its almost impossible to imagine that they wont either given voorns dedication to crafting a big-room anthem that rides the line between underground and overground perfectly much like guy gerber voorn is a master of building tunes that are immediate and yet not immediately annoying fits this mold perfectly unleashing a fist-pump-inducing hook that voorn modulates ever so slightly to keep things fresh throughout its a rare sort of talent and its why he crossed over in a big way last year nd its why this good-time disco-tinged tech house roller will likely do the same
fter catching the attention of minimal house lovers with his first cadenza 12-inch ( k pedro) emerged as a producer to watch in 2007 his latest project is a two-track ep for his own label that is sure to please fans of ricardo villalobos luciano and thomas melchior the -side makes great use of syncopation pitting his claps and whippy hi-hats against a deep subtle bass line halfway through we hear some d x influenced bleeps and tweaks that make this up-tempo track playful and catchy yet still complex and challenging it would be perfect in fact if it werent for the overuse of the shaman-like vocal some self-editing would have helped as dropping that sample every other measure detracts from an otherwise brilliant arrangement is more than 11 minutes long but contains subtle changes in its detailed percussion and arrangement that make it an excellent dj tool if it were mixed with an equally lengthy track on the flip is definitely suited more for an after-hours setting than a club it sounds more like the eta and than a techno producer inspirescu begins with a long introduction that features nothing more than a pitched down acoustic guitar riff set against a simple kick and some whistles that same melody loops throughout the entire track with subtle variation and after several minutes inspirescu adds some simple claps and some atonal washes of synths with sparse twinkling without a doubt s talent is worthy of the hype he and his romanian partners rhadoo and raresh have received over the last year djs may shy away from buying this release as it isnt exactly made for peak-hour sets and tiptoes into more experimental territory seeing a producer taking risks so early in his career however is definitely something to be applauded
something happens about 90 seconds into s opener and s this single pounding chord comes in turning the track from puerile and pedestrian to fist pumping chances are your fist is going to stay up for the rest of the compilation like the name implies theres something new and different going on with turbo these days and this compilation neatly illustrates it over ten solid no holds barred dancefloor bombs re are no arty ambient interludes no experiments just 62 minutes of 4/4 savagery label has always had a soft spot for techno but its never been this streamlined or powerful weve come a long way from chromeo and gesaffelstein and dorothy were not in montreal anymore new destination isnt quite berlin though you could be convinced from the orthodox techno here but rather makes it out to be of all places toronto side from local duo s storming opener (and s equally strong collaboration with ) the compilation also features most down and dirty track yet on scrap metal basslines rub against the grain of glittering synth arpeggios while returns to the label with the woozy which sounds like its unraveling into a haze of burned circuitry smoke i dont know what theyre putting in the water in canadas largest city but it would seem theres some noxious chemical compound producing the harshest industrial strength techno this side of clr compilations non toronto offerings are thankfully just as strong belgian man of the moment continues his strong run on with a demented drum break that sounds like bank vault doors slamming in rhythm scottish outfit provide s least forgiving moment in overwhelmed by white noise so engulfing you can practically smell the smoke machines dampening the stale berghain air meanwhile we get a taste of a promising newcomer in j s mixdown which takes the rigid grooves of s contribution and wreaks bloody havoc on the rigor mortis corpse represents a move for turbo into exciting new territory and despite its timeliness it also sounds distinctly honest and true this techno is too vital to be trendy its all the more impressive given that it presents a fresh faced roster from canada not the first place youre likely to look when you think of meat and potatoes techno so put your fist down now you ll need to rest it before the next play through because you ll probably be playing it a lot or at least hearing these tracks soundtrack your summer spent in dimly lit rooms

a label linked to the online record shop discus throwers works under the motto brutalism in music unsurprisingly for fans of a past-it architectural movement they put out music that sounds old eps from aufgang b and karamika featured austere rhythm tracks drawing on post-punk and minimal wave (their fourth release will be a reissue of an actual 80s record ) the labels third transmission uses similar materials but gives them a sharper stranger edge that is audibly modern the producer is melbournes whose slow-mo groove tools have a disco sway that betrays his past life in the dfa duo canyons releases on his own body language label have been intriguing but the ep is quite a bit better s spine is a sharp syncopated percussion pattern a post-punk clave around which a dense grid of interlocking percussion builds subsides and builds again the overarching structure is basically electro but its brittle and full of complex sub-mechanisms is darker and the sparse arrangement is interrupted by dramatic blasts of reverb both tracks are patient and steady picking up momentum as they go duo 3rd featuring one half of karamika take this approach to heart in their remix of the title track its a hypnotic synth piece that gently loops over nine minutes building a surprising intensity not much of the original is kept intact but the vocal sample is: a womans bemused question happened to me answered by a man i dunno but it was pretty sensational
one of the newest releases to come out of fingerlickin comes from a new artist - already theyve been recieving much praise for this release and have also been busy late touring the uk showcasing their dj style side a groove diggin more of those funky styled breaks that one would expect from fingerlickin with that housey stadium rockin plump djs influence the vocals are sampled from some unknown 70s funk tune and the track is complete with funky guitar stabs a wicked bassline and a drum beat you can dance to theres even a nice breakdown in the middle of the song that djs better watch out for or this will throw your mix off by one bar side b get above yourself opening up this track is a drum beat that sounds very similar to jinxs 2001 anthem kutt free with a bit of 80s styled drum taps to make it sound similar to saltnpepas push it - that should make an interesting bootleg filled with build ups throughout this tune is something youd expect from the plump djs with the heavy bass and deep vocals telling listeners to get above yourself add in some 303 squelch and a synth riff near the end and even more build ups ad youve got an awesome tune - definitely one for a loud system fingerlickin bring out some of the best in funky breaks and this release is no exception personal pick is groove diggin as it gets heads nodding and arses shaking
n music atmosphere is all that matters john daly said in an interview about project which debuted on further records in 2013 is where the rish producer can really indulge himself and move away from the deep house hes been known for since day one but atmosphere has always been a defining element of dalys music and atmosphere is what makes it special daly typically makes by-the-books house music infused with a certain emotion not quite euphoria not quite melancholy a good daly production is both ethereal and earthy on listen first album he floated above the framework of dance music to explore these feelings more directly t was a pleasant little diversion marked by his usual sense of economy and musicality with the latest album under the alias daly wades even further into the deep end getting lost in reverb and swaying beats music on comes from a fairly obvious pedigree; its difficult not to hear aphex twin and boards of canada in the albums opening run of ambient techno starting with the dramatic through to the rousing ose these first few tracks sound more like exercises than expressions is where daly finally lets himself float away layering melodies in gorgeous flowing cascades the reverb and soundstaging is impeccable albums back half ditches the early 90s obsessions daly zooms in on tiny bits of percussion on and n savoring every clap as it rings out in a pool of reverb on singer appears for a fantastic effect conjuring a devotional mood that matches a vocal appearance could be problematic for an album this spacey and atmospheric but sticks to bellowing the title more like a hymn than a pop song res something oddly reassuring about which like its predecessor feels more like a mood piece than a defining work cozy familiarity of dalys music has long been his calling-card and that quality remains vital and lovely on
resident dj/producer l f t fronts the second release from hamburg party-turned-label at its best the four-track is upfront and engaging for instance establishes a hypnotic mood with tight kick-clap combos and a breezy melody that swerves calmly around jittery bass notes follows this up nicely coasting on a shimmer of keys punctuated by light percussion and dreamy french utterances balances a bubbling acid line with hollowed-out percussion and warm chords though the original mix is a bit timid for his remix benedikt injects some energy into the track but it ultimately overshoots the mark feeling out of step with the rest of the ep still havent quite found their footing but the foundation helps establish is solid
has an extensive interest in detroit electro but until recently it was rarely expressed in her music her second album power of anonymity toyed with the squelches and crunches of drexciya records applying them to sleeker drum and synth sounds was one of two tracks that tried to bridge the gap between s record collection and her studio ( treasure seeking was the other also released as a single earlier this year ) doesnt quite reconcile s rich melodic textures with the twitchy electronic bursts it takes cues from the percussion doesnt sit well amid the tracks springy chords: the claps dont smack loud enough and the kicks awkwardly bargain between accommodating house and techno djs and staying true to electros nimble rhythms further the duo of shawn osullivan and katie rose osullivan turn in a discordant remix of the single katie roses half-sung half-spoken vocal feels overly exposed against a barren drum track answer s two contributions stitch together the spasmodic surges of with more assured percussion his revision version fragments the 4/4 rhythm of his vision remix and in doing so assembles a more coherent merger
we know milo smee likes to play rough we also know he loves getting his hands dirty when not drumming in clean jerk (you might have heard their berlin community radio show ) electronic jams are his thing weve already heard a whole albums worth of them from his rambunctious power vacuum label now his ep for treats us to a 3-minute snapshot of the kind of havoc smee gets up to when hes alone in the dark is a treacly doomy acid number thats so lo w-slung it almost buckles around the six-minute mark then its just basement -dwelling growls and hissing sci -fi bits until its over s e g is a cheeky medley of hip-hop and electro pretty funky at first before smee releases an unbridled universe of weirdness its probably what he meant when he told us about the ungraspable style of music he aspires to you can sort of get it its built on parts that maybe once made sense but have since been turned screwy in an after-afterhours sort of way its all systems go on the live-recorded b -side theres dark and skewed techno drexciya and dexter electro hardcore stabs hard rotterdam fx and even a breathy gasp or two its the sound of a madman running wild with his machines its totally mental to use one of smees favourite terms
venetian duo craft deep emotional house music in the kompakt vein this remix ep released in the wake of their debut album has clear overlaps with the 20-year-old cologne label for one theres the personnel matthias and kollektive are both associated with the imprint and taylors provided various remixes as tigerskin but the sound itself is a bloodless version of the tears-on-the-dance floor techno kompakt excels at original centres on a pair of piano riffs one a rolling bass motif one a fleeting heartstring-tugger but neither is quite mournful enough to lodge in the heart or the ear matthias s take is more successful with its growling sub invoking some tension but at eight minutes long its a touch flabby kollektiv s version of would be a solid dub but its minimal undulating groove is spoiled by one of those spoken word vocals that confuses cloying metaphors for emotional depth in taylors hands becomes an ethereal deep house cut or at least it seems ethereal at first but then it loops an underwhelming idea too long with only an organ lick for variety making people cry and dance it seems is harder than it looks
enjoy ambiguity though into their fifth year the rekids-affiliated imprint has managed to keep a relatively low-profile leaving people to speculate while letting the music do the talking for the 30th instalment of their celebrated vinyl-only series matt edwards and james masters have enlisted the services of yet another anonymous trickster on first listen the incongruity of the two tracks is arresting is a full-frontal slice of 90s techno capturing (what i imagine to have been) the thrilling cut-and-thrust of a bygone warehouse scene hefty 808s are kept tightly in check by a steady furore of slamming claps true to the period a single piercing note of acid springs up from the depths instantly grabbing your attention clocking in around 100 pm stripped-back drum affair is on a completely different tip that said mixxs experimental approach to percussion programming is a continued presence with a body of shuffling snares chugging drums and resonant hits forging a swinging strut a dj tool for those more bohemian moments
are up next on the label with a double pack ep dedicated to the tribal lovers out there start it up is first up and it is quite an upbeat tribal number thanks to some intense riffs that build the production and not to mention some strong drum patterns gimme soul (dubbed) is quite deep and dark full of tough gritty sounds and eerie effects the track however lacks a bit of cutting edge despite its use of unique sounds and effects gimme soul (mainline) definitely lifts the pace after the dub version with some more intense drum patterns however much like the dub version the track does flow without direction for most parts despite the deep driving baseline that lifts the track a little in the second half my drums concludes the ep in pure tribal style the drums are the focus here and for me the surrounding effects and subtle melodies are not enough to make this track stand out quite a disappointing ep with all tracks really lacking a cutting edge even for fans of tribal based music
the 11th release on italian based mo-do comes from with the release features a remix from the very much in form sultan first up though is the original mix which has quite a funky edge to it with the very smooth baselines nice whispered vocal patterns and very subtle melodies that work quite nicely in the loop a very nice summer production from the sultan mix has quite a similar vibe to the original mix with a very smooth flow used as well as the nice vocals from the original which are used but not as much as the a-side for me though this remix does lack a little bit of cutting edge that is usually present in sultan s work a pretty good release here on mo-do with the a-side probably the highlight of the release

f a recent remix for ostgut ton freshly pressed us music wares and a spate of international bookings are anything to go by bristol-based s star is very much on the rise nd while his signature sound (if you can even call it that) isnt exactly everyones cup of tea jittery bass-heavy electro-step is never going to have the mass appeal of say deep house its both effective on the floor (his live sets are electric) and refreshingly idiosyncratic just listen to the two tracks here arriving via bristols promising imprint both fit loosely into the dubstep category but only by default: ir swung breaks and heaving bass although similar in tempo have little to nothing in common with the kind of inane slug-step that makes up the genres mainstream rather they trade on melodic nuance and rhythmic pliability hopping skipping and bobbling along without the slightest recourse to kitchen sink barbarism -side is a case in point picking up where 2009s glitchy squirming dodgem left off but with added low-end punch and tongue-in-cheek robot vocals built around a series of crafty drops (one well over a minute long) its dance floor gold for djs looking to build mid-set tension and comparably skullduggerous in its genre-evading swagger b-side is a little more straight up employing sledgehammer kicks and thick chunky wafts of bass in a lumbering 2-step forward march but rather than relying on low-end heft alone (something a lot of uk bass music is guilty of right now) tourettes chips in with haunting dub chords and a darkly funked up lead melody akin to something techno pin-ups mathew jonson or udion might have come up with back when minimal was alluring ts about as sexy a piece of dubstep (or whatever you wish to call it) you could wish for
hardwax regular and berghain resident michael fiedler has been in the dance floor bomb business for more than 15 years but were not accustomed to seeing his name unattached to erik errorsmith wiegands his partner in the famed mmm label whatever bug caught that made him decide that now was the time to strike out on his own well be glad he caught it while very much fits the mmm mold of unfettered arrangements and fluorescent sounds this particular wheel of cheese feels like its been aged to subtle perfection indeed theres an ethereality to s solo sound thats been conspicuously absent throughout mmms run the title cut captures surprisingly muted drums orbiting a few knotted-up notes on paper its arrangement bears a good deal of similarity to tunes like touch go but the takeaway is completely different: airy and exquisite its as dreamy as youd imagine this sound gets on the flip ndreas bangs a bit harder but you still sense keeping a tight grip on the clamor in the end contains as much firepower as any erik record though the extent of its impact sneaks up on you more than most
given ctress and s status as two house and technos best loved outsiders this 12-inch which sees ctress pull apart s of and reassemble it to his own spec is something a dream pairing the original taken from last years paranormal soul lp has just the sort chilly mood youd expect ctress to gravitate towards s such 1 isnt a radical overhaul so much as a subtle retooling but ctress strips away the varnish to reveal cracked raw textures and thickens up those trademark pads until they take on an intoxicating richness in line with the original he veers close to straight techno but tinkers with the rhythmic architecture in subtle ways removing a support strut here and there to leave it subtly lopsided but all the more compelling for it 2 in an an act perversity typical ctress is essentially the same track but pitched down to a sluggish crawl the result is codeine-addled dub in the vein the recent silver cloud dream come true but abstracted even further the gaping holes in the texture plugged with insulating tape hiss its an appealing concept but at 12 minutes a listen through is something an endurance test still you get the sense that he wasnt trying to impress so much as make a point though precisely what point is as always unclear

rather unfortunate side-effect of the post-dubstep diaspora of the last few years has seen a raft of producers studiously distilling the hyper intricate drum programming of producers such as pearson sound and rockwell and foregrounding it to the detriment of well everything else yu saeda a tokyo-based producer with close ties to goth-trad does rather succumb to this fevered approach to percussion with his second release for 7even but thats not to say that it is without its charms as described clicks and thrums at every conceivable juncture but its the sparsely deployed details that are of more interest here such as the honeyed gossamer pads that melt onto the whirring and clacking midway through shame that doesnt indulge his sweet tooth more here shares s brooding outlook and spends a good three minutes or so threatening to lose itself in its own drum programming but out of nowhere bursts with a stuttering arpeggio that lends the tracks spectral atmosphere a bit of bounce where s 7even debut the playful rave and drum bass experiment sign promised so much finds saeda selling himself short
although a solid release s 2009 comeback album constant limber searched for the dance floor straying somewhat unevenly across diverse terrain mixing house techno and dub in varied proportions in short constant limber sounded like a man stepping out after a long isolation and assimilating new ideas into his own language his new album for is much more complete a coherent document whose one step further toward the dance floor may nonetheless unsettle those still in reverence of the deep atmospheres of his past work in taking that step forward however completes a satisfying and perhaps unintended circle of works although his fifth official album feels more like the closing act of a trilogy begun with vibrant forms i and ii from the mythical chain reaction years and extending through to the more ambient spaces album on s own defunct vibrant music label these three sets form a trinity of mind soul and body the vaporous intangible atmospheres of spaces represent the lightness of the soul whereas the two vibrant forms collections were alternatively more hermetic coiled up and lost their own thoughts arriving at the body is most obviously reflected in the dance floor tendencies but also in the physically dense construction of the tracks whereas most (dub) techno tracks play games of construction balancing one sound on another pulling them away or adding them in to change the tension and momentum works differently sounds are added and taken away but the balance never changes the music is essentially perfused full to bursting and at times impermeable to its own details even as it works effectively in the club and for example both kick off heavily and stay low to the ground bruising out sturdy four-to-the-floor rhythms but the shimmering patterns below the surface of cant influence the propulsion while the springing metallic rhythms of bounce playfully but harmlessly off the rollicking bass is smoother and sleazier but the dub patterns play second fiddle to the muscular mid tones when the hi-hat drops it barely shifts the momentum forward and are both the most melodically extroverted and easily penetrable perhaps for this reason they form the first single slips along a sublime and yet heavy dub-groove with sugary propulsion while is more classical and prismatic yet still full of peak time energy two exceptions to the rule are which plots out a more downbeat mood and the pure jamaican-styled dub reggae of recorded live in one take together they help to modulate the pace of the album that said the greatest criticism of is still the density of each track it may help the majority of these tunes work in the club but it masks the dub details that keep the music in flux there is a wealth of dynamism at the core of each track but reaching it can mean effort that may alienate some listeners even despite its occasional frustrations however is a solid work both sonically and in quality and one that also marks out a new and welcome domain for a mysterious and intelligent artist

s debut kingdoms showed a surprisingly confident disco producer whose music felt way too polished for the dilapidated diy of 100 silk ut something about the release still felt tentative the production values perhaps or just the songwriting itself mike norris returns a year later on spectral suddenly sounding more lively and full as if the seeds he sowed with kingdoms had flourished is apprehensive and big-hearted all at once cutting its smeary synths with clipped vocal phrases and tinfoil 2-step percussion it lacks the thump we crave from disco but its luxurious textures more than make up for this lowtec steps in for a remix and unravels the track in his typical fashion jumping on its stranger elements and letting the climax slowly fall away to a brittle rhythm its that shows the most growth though the track is simple norris deft synthesis recalls a rainy-day todd terje: he similarly layers bite-size melodic phrases and wrings depth out of a single synth sound
re is a natural tendency to see techno history in a series phases everything sounded like detroit techno through 1 0s particularly in europe techno got harder and faster and increasingly lunkheaded when it re-emerged as a significant force in minimal era it was subtler and less rigidly schematic but as this reissue three early albums makes clear such broad generalisation crumbles under close scrutiny basictonalvocabulary balance and force form released at a time when was an essential taste-maker loudly contradict idea that by late 1 0s european techno was creatively bankrupt in anthony childs case he was already exploring noise minimalism (check beautiful haunted ) musique concrete or on force form discursive extended tracks long before se things would become common in techno child didnt suddenly discover those influences on 2011s revered breaking frame he hasnt changed has world came around to his way thinking raw and murky ferociously intense and ten very funky pretty much all basictonalvocabulary for me pick this triptych could be deployed tonight in a club to devastating effect if dettmann and klock are not regularly dropping lacerating or whose hurtling jittery momentum catalyses a moment transcendent ecstasy y should be such joyful energy runs contrary to perception child as a forbidding purveyor dark techno as with any artist anger and pain are threads in his work but even heavier blasted percussion work-outs on balance such as or are bookended by luminous delicate laptop whirrs and clicks and echo-laden electronic chamber music dinahs beneath that harsh exterior child has a big heart arguably too many albums are reissued historical weight bearing down on dance music is crushing but its difficult to begrudge child this moment 7 - will not only make you question your perception but in how contemporary it sounds will pose difficult questions about contemporary techno how progressive can that scene claim to be when in se albums and basic channels back-catalogue you can hear its sound being mapped-out 20 years ago
what makes ack in 2006 it was deep house vibes for philpot two years later it was a sublime melding of techno and dubstep for sheds subsolo records nd now in its something else altogether thats par for the course for dave huismans the producer behind the project the only thing that isnt is 2562 his celebrated dubstep-centric moniker is his outlet for hybrids and genre workouts its the former thats at play in / seeing huismans bring out a two-step stutter and pairing it with house and techno atmospherics the rhythm skips along on both tracks of this his third 12-inch for his self-titled imprint huismans ear for a hook is what makes him special however: s squelch recalls golden-era rave contrasting perfectly with the sedate strings in the back the same sort of tension is found on with a touch of dub thrown in for good measure like all producers operating in the grey areas between genres these days though its hardly a concern for huismans where it comes from does it sound cool is the only question worth asking the answer in / case is an emphatic yes

marking the first single release from rekids offshoot label pyramids of mars is the debut from roman zzaro k rouge m canique paris-raised italian who now resides in erlin is a graduate of renowned french music institution conservatoire de paris so its no great surprise that live instrumentation forms the basis of this two-track jaunt through bluesy disco comparable to output recordings iconic releases at the turn of the century the title track is a post-punk shuffler with clapped percussion slashing amp feedback and the late introduction of a spoken-word passage originally composed for a fashion show by french designer urelia paumelle -side is lower-slung led by slide guitar riffs and funk drumming it resembles peter kruders dub tracks as peace orchestra and it serves as an intriguing taster for an album later in the year
s not every day you come across a sprawling neo-d b concept album described by its creator as a vivid daydream kept memorised by its translation into art a narrative of adventurous intentions dashed by unforeseen misfortune and an observation of disengagement from a cyclical reality replete with its very own website and scores of accompanying photos but thats what you get with london-based s debut lp arriving a healthy six years into his production career s an intimidating prospect bursting with implied significance and conceptual grandeur yet for all its ostensible magnitude (this is criticals first-ever lp no less) the end results are strangely ambiguous if not largely anti-climactic but this is no criticism rather a constant tension between narrative specificity on the one hand (a doomed journey into post-apocalyptic frica is very roughly the premise) and laissez-faire creative abandon on the other makes both challenging repeat listening is a must and perversely satisfying granted the sonic landscape is nothing radically new (think barebones nu-school drum bass of the squashed bass/muted atmospherics/metronomic percussion variety with added downtempo excursions) but its by some way the furthest know primarily for deep jazzy rollers like riverside and original sin has delved into full-on utonomic territory and comes off as a powerful manifestation of that schools aesthetic syntax tense meandering collage of tracks vignettes and interludes disc one plays like the score to a survival documentary that was never made (something the abovementioned snaps only serve to magnify) never really peaks but rather ambles around in bass-soaked reverie teasing the listener with all manner of percussive intricacies structural cul-de-sacs and vocal asides highlights include whose oily subs and dripping snares threaten to cocoon the listener leveling pt in which s gritty rhymes rub up against a dark menacing step-hop riddim and the breathtaking ns thoroughly portishead-esque in its desolate drugged-out splendour but such singling out of individual tracks is ultimately pointless: this is an album to be listened to in whole or else not at all cd two on the other hand sees adorn his club hat for a series of discrete floor-friendly edits drafting in studio cohort lix and rising star rockwell for support latters take on the excellent title track certainly hits the spot anyone familiar with his razor sharp brand of militant beat science will know what to expect but predictably enough its who steals the show generously extending the likes of and into system-stretching behemoths that djs of a deeper disposition will lap up s a quality package all in all never taking itself too seriously (despite the haughty rhetoric) but rather revelling in its own sense of adventure and the resultant arbitrariness of its final form(s) t once labyrinthine and unnervingly concise anyone with even a passing interest in open-ended open-minded bass music would do well to give it a listen nd another nd another
with his partner miles whittaker off tracing ley lines with the duo demdike stare pendle covens gary howell sets off on his own blackened path ground is as elemental as its title all seismic rumble and cavernous delay the bass is so swollen that it all but loses any harmonic properties; faint banshee wails provide a hint of tone color but otherwise this is as dark as it gets swallowing up all light like a black hole fter similar records from giorgio giglis zooloft label and artists miles and ndy stott im not sure that it brings anything radically new to the table but techno miserablists who double as sunn 0))) fans will find plenty of sooty seduction in the all-encompassing collapse lbedo trudges along even more slowly 94 beats per minute by my count but its not as suffocating with bright cymbal flashes illuminating the way and a hard flat kick drum beneath it sizzles like an electrical short fleshed out with metallic clang and bright unlikely chords (a tribute to the seattle doom-metal icons ) follows a similar formula but it takes us all the way up to a comparatively sprightly 110 beats per minute the stumbling cadence splits the difference between techno and bass music with shredded vocals and sickly bass buzz as nasty as nstams low end leaning heavily towards the latter camp s far as chopped-and-screwed industrial soul goes it does the trick just fine
on the collective vol i rio padice and leskin inaugurated their new label with a split ep di lena sounded at odds with his cohorts: the dark mechanical slant of off the chain was worlds apart from their super-smooth deep house contributions left to his own devices on second release di lena sets about further exploring this techno terrain setting motorised shots of electricity over a framework of rough kicks and snares wastes little time in getting down to the nitty-gritty recalling the clinical impact of boddika joy orbisons mercy its a devastatingly no-nonsense dance-floor moment is housier combining glitchy synth melodies with lolloping kicks to form a scatty but endearing whole thick drums and an annoyingly incessant bassline on place di lena back on the straight and narrow albeit with intermittent flashes of his more radical experimental side is equally as repetitive but better captures the essence of loop-based techno centring on a tough-but-funky kick/bass combo the records jittery reiteration of the words white christmas are an unnerving take on louis armstrongs fireside classic
ben micklewrights work as on his own label fear of flying and labels like secretsundaze tsuba and underground quality has marked him as a purveyor of deep emotive 4/4 he appears here on huxleys saints sonnets label maintaining its impressive run with four atmospheric house tracks that encapsulate his style growls with intensity from the off its low-ends interplay with myriad electronic percussion and metallic flecks gradually emerges into full acid tweaks and floating layers has the loosest framework its insistent lead lapped at in turns by ghostly vocals glowing synths and splashes of organ a bass phrase evokes the club but in micklewrights own restrained way s grooves lean on muscular kicks and brash hats watery pads and a two-note phrase are the core of a track that whirrs with metallic sonics and echoing squelches as it weaves its spell closer treads a path between booming kicks and rim shots offsetting the grunt with soft chords and glittering phrases at its mid-point washed melodies and subtle notes swerve briefly away but it soon regains its beguiling tone
boris steffen doesnt grace us with records all that often listening to his output though and you get the sense that the wait is largely due to the care and attention paid to every beat glitch and wobble thats exactly how bobs youre uncle ep sounds at least: unrushed collected and entirely assured the epic gedons morphs several times during its fifteen minute running time beginning its life as a melancholic jaunt through windswept half-whispers and shifting sand dunes of synth and ending up a tumultuous storm of swooping robotic raptors tearing the meat and bones of the tracks to pieces as indulgent as it is to make a track this long its real genius is that it never feels indulgent quite the opposite in fact cutting down the length would have done it a disservice and not allowed it enough breathing space for this organic monster to reach its full potential the power and groove of the bassline drives the other two tracks forward here dark intimidating and purposeful it bludgeons through your chest and rattles your heart around inside it always seeming one step ahead of where you expect it to be and while and dont quite live up to gedon the off-kilter metallic warps of the former and twisting ambient shadows of the latter still leave plenty of cavernous soundcapes to explore
pirac debt is something of a berlin-via-dublin dreamteam combining the talents of lumigraph bong gozling and peter ward of breaking through duo terriers their first track together arrives from hometown label where terriers have released their best work so far and finds them recording live with a deceptively simple hardware setup ts a rough-and-ready approach that nonetheless delivers a deep almost smooth kind of acid house ll blown-out 303 notes and battered drums at first sounds knotty and brash but its plush synth chords warm the soul as they go down warped voices and smears of delay lend it a druggy edge adding another layer to the trios broad range dj sotofett taps into that subtly psychedelic vein on his remix and amplifies the effects for an ambitious 15-minute version that somehow never overstays its welcome his remix rides the original pads and a slow-bouncing 808 kick pattern on loop only dropping out either one when transitioning to the tracks next phase t might not be something you could play all the way through the low-slung energy often gives way to all that psychedelia but the final third alone works out a fantastic percussive groove
for someone only born in the early 90s california producer aka taylor freels has a impressively complete grasp of what makes a classic house cut for this second release on lph white a new offshoot of lets play freels follows up the impressive waze odyssey remix he contributed to the labels first ep with four original cuts of well-executed peak-time house opener sets the eps mood by taking off at a ferocious lick with hooky vocal samples and a thumping bass drum duelling with insistent synths kims runs along similar lines carrying itself forward on racing hi-hats and adding a deep-filtered mid-track breakdown pairs more booming kicks with a flexing synth loop while is a similarly pacy but more spectral beast a chiming spacey synth mingling with another vocal loop and softer drums variation is at a premium here (as youd perhaps expect from a label with stated dance floor aims) but each of these tracks will fit snugly into sets from any number of houses current hot tickets
since it was founded in 2009 dre skulls has been home to an incredibly broad range of bass-heavy sounds artists like jubilee and douster have tended towards clubbier house and techno influences and murlos been the primary flag-bearer for more grime-style rhythms but if theres one thing thats tied the aesthetic together its dancehall producers like famous eno poirier and dubbel dutch have been mainstays with a number of eps that all put their own spin on the genre many of dancehalls household names spice konshens vybz kartel have also released on the label often pairing with dre skull to create a polished and pop-influenced sound that has become their own one release in particular really put the label on the map globally: the debut album from veteran mc popcaan where we come from the record stood out from most other dancehall as it seemed to abandon much of the scenes perhaps intimidating aspects its not sexually aggressive nor homophobic with production that was primed for radio play more than rib-shaking soundsystems given the success enjoyed after where we come from it makes sense that their next album would continue in this vein and thats what producer and vocalist njy keating aka has done on much like the music that so clearly influenced him keatings instrumentals are stripped to the bare essentials whereas the skeletal shapes remaining in dancehall tend to whip clubs into a frenzy leaves you with ethereal trance synths and woozy trap-like percussion coupled with his soft half-whispered vocals the sound makes for great summer pop tracks opener is one such number wonderfully straddling the line between bbq soundtrack and heartsick anthem such combinations are successful on a track-by-track basis but over the course of the album the idea starts to drag three or four songs into it becomes hard to grasp any distinctive elements sure there are a couple of notable moments like the detuned melody of and the sparse beat of an airy thin quality defines keatings sound but it leaves you wanting more substance and thats not to mention how often the vocals slide towards a cringe-inducing pseudo-patois that makes the whole experience feel inauthentic keating might not consider himself a dancehall artist but the genres influence is too obvious to ignore written and produced entirely by the young ondoner is a singular vision theres plenty to enjoy no individual track is a misstep but consumed as whole goes from sugary pop to sickly sweet and is ultimately unsatisfying

electro is giving way to speeding neo-trance in the race for club supremacy and yep that means it s time for another digweed single i mean think about it every time progressive reaches towards a new sound mr edrock seems to put out a single to punctuate the evolutionary change when progressive trance was at its peak edrock released heaven scent later on santiago coincided with the deeper spiral that progressive went into s electro took hold warung each hit the stands nd now as the torch has passed to this neo-trance/minimal/whatever make way for digweed s latest yet despite its trappings is still a continuation of what came before there s a familiarity to its sound harking back to what edrock was releasing ten years ago on the epically proportioned mix rich synths flow warmly against a classic progressive house bassline reminiscent of heaven scent nd while never really pushing the constraints of its framework there s enough depth and texture to keep it entertaining the mix on the flip is a tougher darker take with sci-fi bleeps and jagged robotic effects replacing the orchestral layers of the mix it s a more energetic mix and it s the one that will probably see the most club action while this release probably won t take clubland by storm it tides diggers over until the next genre comes along and reinforces his studio partner nick muir s reputation for excellence
one of the things that made me fall in love with prosumer and murat tepelis serenity was the pervasive melancholy that ran through the album t was one of the most relentlessly retro records of last year but it reached above mere mimicry because it sounded like as jon pareles in the new york times put it house music utterly deflated you certainly cant say that about the duos latest 12-inch y far the most upbeat tune that theyve ever recorded is nearly pop house a track whose middle four minutes almost begs for a radio edit s you might expect the remit here is classic house sounds with a refrain that implores you to keep your moving feet you can hear tinges of the melancholic floating around in the background via frequent collaborator elif icers vocals she sings the title as well as adding general atmospheric color but its pushed back in favor of a robust chord pattern and cobblehorse percussion follows up the -side and comes off like a perfect complement more driving it borrows trace elements from its predecessor but cuts the vocals to a bare minimum and focuses solely on the groove ts not quite inflated but its about as muscle-bound as youre likely to hear this duo ever get
(joey fehrenbach) is next up on us based records with 2 solid cuts that are sure to have a massive appeal on the progressive front headpusher featured on nick warrens last global underground release while structure on the flip is just as impressive and emotive on the a-side is headpusher the track features some well-produced drum patterns with an ever-present baseline throughout that gives it a good drive some effects soon take presence in the production giving it a bit of a dirty funk appeal midway into the track though some sooth vocal samples give the tune a bit of a calming influence to the eventual conclusion a solid production indeed on the flip is the impressive structure a pretty standard 4/4 drum patterns begins proceedings accompanied by a subtle bell like sample effect as with the a-side a soothing vocal sample is used but plays a much more vital role in this production the production rides along with the changes in the vocals until the breakdown gives the tune a touch of emotion the vocals then build taking the track out in style another solid piece of music a good release from you really have to appreciate 2 solid tracks on 1 slab of vinyl and that is exactly the case with this release be sure to have a look
when you hear the terms dubstep and america the next word that probably springs to mind is skrillex theres definitely more interesting stuff coming from the us of a however; its just a little harder to find based in miami are one such imprint attempting to turn the genre in another direction thus far theyve been doing pretty well this being their fifth record since starting back in april that said much of their material isnt actually local for instance comes from a ukrainian artist the only problem with this particular ep from the label is a lack of deliberateness often backing pads or other incidental sounds feel arbitrarily placed with incongruous chord progressions to match its as if composed each percussive skeleton (which are interesting in themselves) and then thought thats too sparse i need to come up with some stuff to fill in the gaps otherwise theres not a great deal to complain about in pursuing eerie atmospheres the record certainly hits the mark and do best in this regard pairing miniscule bells with vast space and shivering pads from both the resulting mental image is something like an abandoned music box playing in a dark dilapidated mansion in and harsher sounds come to the fore the focus that a pretty melody affords they more or less fall into the aforementioned trap of arbitrary composition despite several interesting ideas and are the strongest of the collection the former is set to a gentle amniotic pulse tying in light pieces of piano and hints of child voice in the title track several layers of piano are comingled to create a frantic edge with more bell-based interludes breaking up the intensity

after two strong releases from co-owners hound scales and divvorce brooklyns fifth wall has become a label to watch this six-track ep from young scottish duo sees the first external addition to fifth walls roster preceding their forthcoming album on turbo calum macleod and liam robertson deliver four typically industrious and raw-edged productions both and finale simply and effectively combine muscular distortion with a jackhammer tempo is equally unremitting eastern instrumentation is woven through clashing percussion giving things atmospheric resonation the pile-driving momentum eases on t-ao which finds the duo steering towards a 90s idm sound for the remixes hound scales strips-back to give it more of a detroit feel while divvorce smoothes s coarse edges
whether you are of the opinion that modern dance music was invented by three friends in detroit or by a troupe of german cycling enthusiasts it would be wanton disregard to dispute the importance of the beating heart of frica as its abiding progenitor it is hard to imagine where our appreciation for rhythm would stand without the deep-rooted influence of this continent; and for a micro-culture in which provenance is so obsessively revered and imitated it should be of particular interest that such intrinsically frican flavours take to the fore in this latest release from gerd jansons imprint is the zanzibari native who steals the limelight here with her indigenously sanguine vocals however in an r coup by janson it is the charge of much-admired producer maurice fulton to vamp the east fricans work into the gloriously sun-drenched afro-boogie fusion that this 12-inch comprises if the unfettered percussion pop-friendly sensibility and effortless funk of this record are pointers towards what lies ahead on the collaborative pairs forthcoming album tungi then we all have a veritable treat in store i only refrain from scoring this even more highly for a lack of additional material on the package: while the flip-side dub reworks the original to a certain extent a remix or further album-teaser would have no doubt been better value though lets not get caught up on nitpicking: note for note sunbeam for sunbeam is really rather magnificent
keith worthys emotional content was the first track on the first release of his imprint and its two words that have guided the label ever since over the course of its initial five releases the prevailing theme has been affecting melodies mixed with deep beats hearkening back to an era when detroit techno was just beginning to find the soul in the machine the labels sixth its first from englishman is no different lionni has had a strong with releases on versatile mule electronic and figure but this two-tracker is firmly in line with s sound pulsates its way through its eight minutes gradually unspooling various melodic threads moving them up-and-down in the mix like chess pieces might be even better a perfect storm of soft revolving lasers a deep kick and a repeated vocal stab that floats away into the ether its hard to describe the tracks here without falling back onto terms like classic quintessential or vintage lionni isnt concerned with the new instead like the rest of esthetics output these are tracks built to stand the test of time they are defiantly backwards-looking fully-formed compositions that sound like they had existed previously and merely had to be uncovered rather than produced in a studio through hard work ut whether lionni spent five minutes or five years on this is hardly the point as the result is the same: nother winner from esthetic
considered a veteran in the scene nowadays returns to make his debut in the year with this release on gravitation is the name of this season opener and it is finally given a long overdue release aided by a nice remix from mood society the original mix is first up and the trademark deep low end sounds from are introduced early into the track as the baseline rains down shortly after commencement quirky unique effects smother the production as the track builds soon enough building towards a nice set of melodic tones that set the tone of the production for the most part pretty solid work from andrew here on the flip mood society turns in their interpretation and it is quite a chunky one at that the beats are very solid and heavy and the melodic tones from the original feature nicely in this remix the track really turns into a stunning piece deep in as smooth stunning string patterns come into the production working nicely in unison with the melodic tones and heavy drum beat a very tasty release here by gravitation and andrew byrne once again showcases his quality in the studio
deliberate scarcity is an excitant if its in your line of vision it makes you crave more following on from the sure hand demonstrated by s pair of quality eps from last year cid love and the world of techno every bit as old-school as their titles indicate and as new-world mysterious as youd expect from uq this -inch his first new issue since october ups the ante by sticking to 500 copies and not going digital 7 starts out with a slow-building percussion match and then two minutes in it breaks down to a three-note keyboard hook later joined by bass and a friskier hi-hat rhythm that buoys things considerably ut once that initial jolt fades thats about it its a nice old-fashioned house groove but its one that more or less plateaus out the flip builds more gradually; its lush in a very mid-90s kind of way boxy bass sighs and exhales forming a deep backdrop tense pads and when the first cymbal crash brightens the sound picture about two minutes in theres a jolt finally the beat will drop for real (though not for another 45 seconds or so) its a lovely track particularly if you like limited editions if not and if tsuba really does keep its word well dont go broke worrying about it

renatos alo alo was a bold opening statement for a label a patchwork of half-danceable samples with the odd madcap touch it was difficult to predict and harder to pigeonhole s second ep from its other founder is almost as strange it opens brightly with the kitschy synth-disco of whose arps form twinkling cascades over a biscuit-tin kick drum but the mood soon shifts with two minutes of inky synth wash and whose beat shuffles at a zombies pace under ghoulish moans by the time we get back to a dance floor pulse the portuguese producer is in a more thoughtful mood (a mood hes previously explored on a couple of dreamy eps for diskotopia ) theres something of four tet in s pretty cloudlike chimes and measured house groove the one hint of mischief comes from a sampled bar of something a snatch of distant strings the whisper of a voice that bursts out of the twilight every couple of minutes is a dusty slow-stepper that gets weirder as it goes the sidechained chords begin to woozily swirl and then odd samples shouts terse piano chords blasts of slap bass start popping up as if s whacky side were straining to be free
mike silver has worked tirelessly on his music as for nearly seven years honing his skills as a songwriter while pulling in an array of influences to color his compositions his output has spanned electro-pop kosmiche house new age modern classical ambient and many permutations therein the consistent thread being a dedication to both the highest and lowest brows of late-70s and 80s music a record is often where popol vuh and talk talk mingle with phil collins or peter gabriel takes tips from philip glass and jan hammer alike so its no surprise when that heavily referential sound is called hokey generic pastiche or the like those words are an easy way to nail down an artist to the fallout of certain bygone eras but at what point do influences turn from dubious curiosities to tenured stylistic touchstones well if that hasnt happened for silver yet is it this is the second album in and its also his best yet where radiance and submission distilled his softest inclinations into eight glimpses of smoky nocturnal pop unfolds a dynamic 40-minute orchestration in 12 movements former was a newish wrinkle in the repertoire while the latter finds silver delivering his best ideas with an effortlessness wrought by years of experience music for objects and river are the closest relatives to this material but now that music is conceived more as music for sunsets or ocean wave sounds wash over the pan flutes and marimbas as if silver is attempting to transport us onto a beach through synesthesia sections titles tell a different story however: departure pyramid a real dream imagination and return outline a more metaphysical journey and they often sound equally transcendent has style and mood to spare but it ultimately succeeds because of well-paced sequencing and the breadth of skill at work in its arrangements silver composed the piece to evolve in 12 stages and it does so seamlessly with no lack of care and detail in every phase most of has a quiet 4/4 pulse just shy of 100 bpm loosely interwoven world music instruments are draped over the beat saxophone guitar piano and all manner of synths also grace the ever-shifting mix and occasionally unravel for a weightless glide heavy toms and snares appear only about 25 minutes in pulling you from the balmy trance in a simple yet exhilarating way y also point out how silver hadnt yet introduced any proper drums to his piece and both the keen sense of restraint and impeccably timed delivery speak to his compositional finesse anyone who throws on is likely in it for the long haul so its important that the experience rewards consistent listening silver has explicitly said that phil collins hand in hand inspired the earliest stages of as he explains: it s a super simple corny song built on a roland cr-78 loop and just the silliest pan-global optimistic tone and i got into the idea of doing a record of music like that kind of trying to push to the edges of tolerable cheese in some places but also have it be totally sincere and not ironic like actually purely pleasurable music his comments offer the best way to approach this record; timeworn and sentimental as its sounds may be they form an inspired piece that dodges clich even as it pays homage
duo of continue their remarkable run of form with this their second single for in as many years duos secret is a pretty simple one: establish solid grooves then find something interesting to layer on top in s case that means a sly trumpet and what sounds like a keyboard chord emerging from the deep like many of their finest moments the boys also add field recordings for added depth this time around its a jazz caf where presumable would be played its too simple for those purposes but for the dance floor its the type of soulful instrumental house that jocks like soulphiction will be playing the entire summer isnt as easy on the ears awkward in fact might be the best way to phrase it points go to trekka for not settling for an easy deep house groove but sometimes twisting things to avoid clich becomes a clich in itself on the flip however they redeem themselves with mr the which somehow balances a lightness in the top end with a nasty bassline it leaves plenty of space throughout giving opportunity for a synth line to emerge in the second half and take over the proceedings murky funk of however is the gem of the side a slow and low number that sounds like revenge gone microhouse
by now frenchman is entrenched on speedy js imprint (and many others too) this latest release is a good example of why the title track leads off with a shivering bassline one thats remarkably similar to that of perc giorgio giglis 0165 under the endless moniker like many genre tropes its probably been replicated whether intentionally or not for the simple fact that it works its chilly vibrations are crucial in establishing the tracks dank atmosphere whereas concept on the b-side carries a ghostlier feel is distinctly industrial with an ominous chiming on every off beat the only melodic element of real note is well i dont really know what it is a glassy tapping a digitised frog croak whatever the case this ineffable timbre vascillates grudgingly through the scale commanding nearly all the tension as it goes on the other side concept is no more friendly its central feature is a series of extended wails like a far-off train whistle fixmer weaves these unnerving noises with great cunning slipping them out from underneath the heavier parts and bringing their full power to bear while the fading tail of the previous spectre is still holding attention its a kind of sleight of sound rather than hand with the determined power of fixmers two tracks in mind marcel dettmans remix of dance like paranoid feels a little uninspired it begins flatly and dettman never quite manages or wants to overcome this with the originals heavy bell work relegated to a background thrum and towering waves of sandy white-noise washing rhythmically over it though far from it

hot off the heels from soto sonically pleasing ghetto blast ya menu music presents its first double artist release featuring a brand new signing to the label hailing from california josh hinden aka majool has played in various groups ranging from jazz ensembles and reggae group carribean pulse for menu josh has supplied them with the south american inspired electro grooves of buenos aires a firm favourite in the menu stable rico tubbs has certainly developed the menu sound starting from the labels first release flashlighter/brazilia and more recently his remix of sotos ghetto blast ya for this release he keeps his feet in the ghetto with ghetto soul a hefty electro break with bubbly acid overtones kicks off the intro to buenos aires during the first breakdown majool brings forth snippets of the bassline to be used in the track techy fillers and big sweeps once the tune gets settled into its groove its a big electro breaks crossover all the way fusing together acid squelches with a shuffly breakbeat - hence the fact that djs/producers like general midi are well onto this one ghetto soul on the flip shows us exactly why rico tubbs fits in nicely with menus mission statement of rocking the party for starters the tempo has been raised dramatically and the intro features a funky horn sample and a vocal sample asking those out there listening if they can feel a thing the beat drops and the bass starts rocking during the first breakdown and once the beat is re-introduced ghetto soul makes one hell of a party track filled with a little bit o soul for those who loved ricos remix of circuit breaker deckarts supa (the first moneyshot release) and the sounds of aquasky when they did wheels of steel (and similar tunes) will definitely be onto this one ive certainly given this release a few goes for the dancefloor and ghetto soul is definitely the one to play
with you always know what youre going to get: hypnotic sequences soaring leads and an appreciation for trance in its most classic sense inherited from 90s frankfurt and klaus schulze stripped of the 80s overtones of songs like stairway and tenth plateau sounds as pure and as essentially techno as anything dundov has done with a corkscrewing focus akin to silent visitor over nine minutes the track wends its way through dramatic string crescendos and more contemplative acid passages but its underpinned throughout by a single pedal tone the single-mindedness of that descending minor-key arpeggio keeps the track feeling exceptionally grounded while its faint shuffle and bubbling pulse encourage you to dig your heels in even deeper funk has never been high on dundovs list of priorities but theres an additional dose of swing on (perhaps he picked it up working with gregor tresher on solstice the grooviest thing that dundovs ever put his name to ) like the -side its a long meditative journey with a touch of detroit night driving to it illuminated by faint bursts of acid and synths with a coppery gleam
is an exemplary case of how to reckon with artistic tradition: discard with novel repetition and retro fascination and encounter the historical limitations of a previous artistic form as the spur towards new creative possibilities while the track is indebted to classic house being the unmistakable offspring of kevin s inner city album paradise youd never confuse it for its predecessor: the album version is a subtractive attack stripping the inner city sound to the bone and the club mix re-wires it with dizzying chopped-up vocals and bonky filtered rhythmic percolation a further displacement of the classic house style is the lyrics which rather than cheerleading for big fun or the good life are equally a bum trip to those of hercules blind in the place of that tracks disillusionment however here the conceit is centered around romantic disappointment: you belong to him tonight theres nothing i can do its an intriguing anomaly for vocal house as disappointment is rarely the typical emotional impetus for wanting to join the dancefloor throng the appearances here of remixes by two techno legends would seem to further press the stamp of legitimacy down on the hercules crew derrick carter deploys 303 squelch with tasteful restraint and over a chunky invigorating low-end swing allows vocal samples that begin clipped and fragmented to culminate in multi-track hypnotic refrain himself shows up for the third mix upping the house anthem quotient without succumbing to excess his incarnation jacks the bpms and adds classic loose energetic hi-hats and synth stabs managing to take the track to the edge of fiery flamboyance without going up in flames tellingly the vocal line is reduced only to you belong to him tonight effectively curbing the originals buzzkill sentiment and reinscribing it in the tradition of euphoric celebration lastly riton rerubs the tune captivatingly dicing up the tracks jerky syncopation even further before unleashing some abusive synth arpeggiation remixes are possible and exciting because a song is never self-identical all three remixes here are skilled interventions that succeed in igniting the subterranean sparks of possibility implicitly contained in the album original but its ultimately ritons and the hercules club mix which are the most artistically forward-thinking as they are able to envision the historical past not as tradition set in stone but as something yet to come
ever since their 20 debut album hold your colour became one of the biggest-selling electronic albums of all time drum n bass trio ticked off pretty much every rock band clich for prepping their follow up location change perth to london check signing to a major label yep: from the scrappy breakbeat kaos to soul-sucking warner music switching styles sadly yes they ve cashed out their unique arena dnb sound to become electronica-infused nu-metal band no 153b for their latest album lest we forget there s also the law of diminishing returns: three years on and only ten tracks to show for it the album s leadoff seemingly tries to compensate quantity for density by combining the distinctive breakbeat (which sounds more like sped-up breaks than actual dnb) with their new affinity for wailing guitars and crashing live drums mutating every eight bars to include everything from cheesy keyboard riffs to sleazy blues harmonica in silico means performed on computer or via computer simulation but most of the album leans heavily towards vocal-led live instrument rock n roll with the breakbeat there but usually buried under everything else rob swire is capable in his role as lead singer but leaves little impression: it s hard to imagine his run-of-the-mill voice being the reason why ditched their certified-gold dnb sound for something so generic and that s exactly the problem here last summer put out a blinding ep blood sugar / axle grinder and you can hardly believe that tracks like and are from one and the same source apart from lacking any semblance of dnb these two in particular are indistinguishable from the overproduced assembly-line hard rock churning through the top 40 is the album s only (almost) entirely instrumental tune mercifully cutting off the whiny vocals at the two-and-a-half minute mark for four minutes of mischievous drum n bass that should temporarily sate jilted fans is a more laid-back variation on the same theme but frustratingly borrows its vangelis-esque synths nearly note-for-note from plasticworld off hold your colour even if it is just ten measly tunes it wouldn t matter if the album held up in some respect to colour certainly it s easier said than done as that album s first track in particular slam is still one of the most perfect dnb anthems ever made re s nary a bad apple among the remaining 13 tracks either whereas is chock full of them not even a single track can be confidently labeled as good have indeed dropped the ball with a resounding thud on this one but time and tide may let be politely forgotten as their sophomore slump here s hoping they ditch the silly rockstar aspirations and rebound with their original promise intact third time out
madtech affiliate stef lakosa smith joins fellow londoner rick grant co-owner of take records on two atmospheric house cuts with its skippy two-step rhythm and gurgling bass you could describe as dark garage theres a touch of melancholy about which allows a shaft of light to poke through building around a brief female vocal trippy synths and effervescent hi-hats a brace of remixes deviate significantly from the mood of the original studio barnhus co-founder korn l kov cs approaches his with such zeal that theres little to link this quirky house version with the original fluffy breakbeats and stuttering percussion collide on a track whose rhythm at times is so lo-fi it sounds like its being played on a dansette its south london producer james fox under his techno moniker severn who provides the eps most memorable moment his remix is a sparse spaced-out affair that reverberates to yawning bass and a jackhammer kick
dense pika are the kind of artists who take a perverse delight in twisting as many melons as possible alex jones glimpses return to hotflush the scene of last years riotous colt ep gives them an opportunity to expand on the release as they load a half dozen twisted techno bullets into the chamber its difficult to decide which of the six tracks messes with your mind most is it the frazzled military march of with its roaring interjections and door-slamming bass kicks or and its comically pitch-shifted vocal and spanking percussion on arguably the only point on the ep where it feels like dense pika lift the boot off the throat jones and glimpse fuse tribal drums with a nagging synth ping this one is blown out of the water by the stomping which sounds like a robot gone feral with its increasingly deranged digital melody might appear as a welcome change in pace but theres an underlying growling malevolence working away in its basement as the bumping final bars of the eps most melodic moment peters out youd be forgiven for exhaling long and hard
if rush hour is your go-to label for the classiest old house re-issues youll likely appreciate the continued work of manchesters for the second time here they have persuaded veteran deep houser scahtrax to delve into his vaults and offer up some of his classics for re-release if you didnt know they were re-releases you wouldnt know: they fit as snugly into the deep house dialogue of as they did the mid-90s from whence they came as well as three re-issues were treated to an exclusive new release in the form of at its core is a jangly drum workout that hangs somewhere in the cosmos breaking down to nothing but synthy futurism at various points its deep in an utterly uncluttered way on is more vibrant bulbous bass and slapping percussion hint at a penchant for classic king street sounds output where is a woozy low-slung slump aliens proves is not only a keen drum programmer but someone with a real grasp of melody as well bleary drips of colour rain down the face of the track echoing into the distance as effervescent bacterial details fill the middle ground music as genuine as this will likely never sound old
re are moments in s latest wonky take on 4/4 most notably on the discordant ezok that reminded me of one of the most famous sketches in british comedy history its when morecambe wise invite legendary american conductor andre previn to help in a performance of griegs piano concerto when morecambe mangles the music to comical proportions previn accuses him of playing all the wrong notes morecambe grabs previn by the lapels and says im playing all the right notes but not necessarily in the right order copelands career has been marked by unconventionality ever since he played in the brooklyn group black dice here he returns to dfa on his lonesome (black dice debuted on the label back in 2002) if youre wedded to the conventions of house and techno it takes time to rewire your brain for copelands work but persevere and youll be rewarded on sxixo a relentless onslaught of cymbal crashes and distorted african rhythms compete for attention with beats that wander absent-mindedly out of step with the main groove is like listening to tom tom club jamming with money mark at minus 8 closest copeland gets to established modes of house music is on the frenetic if you can consider defiantly lo-fi organ-house conventional
its hard to say what keeps a house label in business money aside quality and consistency are widely considered to be the two main factors but i think theres a lot more to it than that plenty labels releasing excellent music have fallen by the wayside irrespective their standard output while others show no sign slowing down despite consistently dishing out average records in the case the berlin house label managed by knoblauch the reasons for its longevity are fairly clear its arguably the best label occupying an ten overlooked space: fun music for serious partying s aesthetic though hard to define is most at home in clubs like watergate bar 5 golden gate and katerholzig venues in which purist sounds rarely take (or took) preference over more immediate populist fare but where long and linear german style dj sets prevail covers all these bases most its catalogue is serious enough to mix with the most sophisticated minimal yet melodic and uncomplicated in a way that will hold the attention zoned out afternoon ravers as such a cut is just as likely to be mixed into a perlon record as it is cocoon chart topper the labels latest anniversary compilation (which along with a white label vinyl series with the catalogue number va y) has been split into two parts: house and techno) is a more thoughtful endeavour than its back catalogue might suggest but still carries all the hallmarks: catchy melodies vivid emotion and driving floor focussed percussion all the highlights here are house tracks rolling bottom heavy cuts from mainstays like matthias ( ep ) and ( ) show knoblauchs label at its most functional but still have an airy feel good shine elsewhere on one of deliver one their most straight forward efforts yet in a percussive and bass heavy tech house tool and provide more atmospheric cuts with and directing focus away from the kick drum onto sombre sweeping synths walta another staple takes a darker route with is less versatile but still contains some the packages most unique cuts who produced s debut inch back in 004 delivers a bomb with a growling techno track with distorted vocals and thick layers bleeps and synths the house leaning efforts on are the most memorable with and vs both supplying stomping highlights the rest is mostly dance floor techno various types produced by clockwork and all contribute solid efforts but its the house leaning fare that most will reach for is clearly aimed at djs and those who pick it up have plenty to choose from its also an affirmation the longevity that comes when a label finds its space and occupies it well
isnt the debut album we mightve expected from former noise-heads previous releases for his own white material label pointed in a more boisterous direction but with his first solo release for dial richard has turned his gaze from berlins landlocked club scene towards the coastline of his native rhode island explores his interest in the border between civilization and the ocean and features tracks like whose subtle synth layers fold over one another like lapping waves as with most of the tracks beauty isnt in question but its effect is ambiguous: sometimes relaxing sometimes unsettling richards new approach to house is to smooth it down and pare it back on highlight the synths wheel like mournful seabirds over crisp carefully syncopated drums beneath it all is a single held chord a placeholder for the albums mood of steady perseverance richards forays into drone on stately numbers like and compound this feeling risk of such restraint is boredom and does sometimes take on the more negative implications of its title grey for instance is a bit lacklustre though its materials are only fractionally different from those of its better companions a zoomed-in view of often reveals flat almost inert textures it takes a broader perspective to see the albums charms and theyre ample gets more compelling as it runs and more so still with each repeated play some track titles reference the optical phenomenon of the green flash in which a green light can be briefly seen at sunset on an unobstructed horizon (like for instance one observed over a body of water) and (meaning inferior mirage ) find richard at his most withdrawn y prepare the album for its own green flashes moments of surprising beauty that puncture the austere surface res the sparkling arps of and better still closer whose ambrosial chords provide a wash of light after 45 minutes of overcast skies in keeping with richards newfound style both tracks loop serenely at length in s deeper sense of time they feel like theyre over all too soon

it would be interesting to know just how much music rob booth had in his possession before launched the releases just keep on coming from fabrics label wing with no sign of a drop off in quality and with alec storey might have toppled akkords navigate as s strongest ep to date recalling tiny reminders -era two lone swordsman gables pairs mdma-sprinkled synths with a tearing bassline the equally engaging is an amalgamation of two segments from a live set carrying the same spectral ambiance yet with slightly more vigour the title track combines elongated house tones with the suction of a filter before an eight-minute soundscape completes the ep in a wash of droning pulses
with its 50 seconds of aimless echo-chamber wailing at first it sounds like s is going to be another one of those featherweight dime-a-dozen uk house tracks until the vocal hits true gatecrasher the kick drums charge forward with a bloodthirstiness bolstered by the chunky electrified bassline only thing more addictive than the songs unforgettable hook (which is almost evil in its hookiness) is the way it glides with such grace like labelmates gingy + ordello force-fed one too many anti-depressants even better is the careful manipulation where the vocal unspools and winds back up around the beat its a pop song but one with both backbone and instant gratification falls a bit to the wayside in comparison: though it has an almost equally sing-alongy vocal the tracks blinding synths feel cheap and borrowed off some throwaway l2s record throaty bass stabs give it a bit of heft and keep it from drifting too far into the heavens but this ones really all about
electronic music a world in which each producer can be king of his own castle doesnt always place a huge amount of value on collaboration but its a skill that laurie appleblim osborne has honed to a fine art his decade-odd long discography mostly consists of collabs with colleagues in bristols former-dubstep scene and beyond alec storey got his turn back in 2010 when the pair issued a single on aus back then storey was producing turbulent hybrids as al tourettes; these days as the houndstooth-signed second storey hes broadened and deepened his vision for idm-techno fittingly the pairs collaboration returns in a new guise and with a new home r s osbornes skill as a collaborator seems to be his ability to step back; often it feels like hes coaxing fresh ideas out of his workmate from a distance allowing their own distinctive style to breathe so its no surprise that these tracks with their dense structures choppy rhythms and shiny metallic textures sit very much in storeys world this isnt necessarily a good thing particularly in sids which romps along at 140-odd bpm but feels hobbled by its fiddly cross-rhythms and relentless micro-detail side too is frustrating its moments of shimmering prettiness obscured by the sheer density of the arrangement only in beefy electro number whose radically lower tempo allows its swaggering groove to register through all the surface patterning do the pair achieve lift-off

mike hiritzka and kazell (kevin bazell) team up to deliver another storming track fro the label is their latest offering and it delivers the usual smooth house vibes that the label is well known for the original mix has a smooth and nicely flowing groove throughout helped by an extremely groovy baseline as well as some not too heavy beats and a subtle vocal line the track seems to gel together quite easily and is very nice and calm on the ear on the flip the trio known as the monkz team together again on the label after their very impressive single nu bluez to deliver a pretty solid remix here i must confess i was expecting a little more from this reworking for me it isn t as innovative enough compared to the original mix to warrant massive praise but nevertheless it is a solid production full of slightly chunkier beats and nice warm effects taken from the original not a bad release here for the crew with the original mix in particular delivering the goods
its been a while since we last heard from and it would have been around 2000 during the release of akimbo his last long player - it received mixed reviews at the time however it was a mash up of disco funk cheeky samples and really twisted beats (check some kind of love song ) that really gave the album some mainstream appeal 3 years on and andrew kornweibel is now producing fingerlickin styled breaks and it comes as no surprise especially after seeing him bop around on the floor (the dancefloor that is) like a madman at both the plump djs ad krafty kuts gigs at sydneys metro in 2001 side a glottal stomp glottal stomp is a jackin party breaks track sitting on a housey breakbeat not unlike the styles of the plumps themselves added to the mix is a bottom heavy bassline a jazzy piano line and some clever hooks including a vocal sample that just doesnt stop grunting its funk for two feet for side b foot rocker on the flip foot rocker uses one of the nastiest and fartiest basslines ive ever heard on a breaks tune more percussive than glottal stomp foot rocker draws its influence from lee coombs production sitting somewhere between tribal breaks and acid the track starts with the basic element - breaks and bass then brings in a old skool breakdown in the middle and builds up the towards the end - loading up the bassline with acid squelches premature to say at this point but so far it is my favourite of the two - a mix between the hum work ya body and two men on a trip in some ways
we know can do stoney-faced and slamming stuff and hes about as nerdy as it gets with hardware but its his weird and wonky fare that we all secretly lust after nd damn does he know how to get a party started his mischievous backwards gaze coupled with a tendency not to take things too seriously makes electro a natural fit for the edinburgh shapeshifter he properly got into it last year with the collaborative modini project ; for landstrumms latest solo record hes channeled all that cheek into an unusual debut on the hackers the cover art a brazened butt in sexy underwear (with label showing) in front of a floral william morris backdrop sets the tone for extreme pleasure where high- and low-brow club naughtiness converge its dirty seductive dance floor music all detailed and delicately made but begging for rough-handled consumption begins the tease with a ravey bassline and titillating machine melodies before getting a bit more agitated on nyways then returns to the retro 90s tones from fashioning them into a more modern uk bassline sound darkly charged closer nyways would be a vintage techno stomper were it not for that persistent synth line and oddly sunny bridge throwing it off course but thats the thing with landstrumm: nothing is ever straightforward and you cant help having a laugh with it
when you are celebrating 50 releases for a label such as then you look to someone a little special to mark this occasion the crew at have done just that by calling on the services of luke chable as well as chris salt to put their remixing touch on two classic releases for the label on the a-side luke chable gets to grip with dub sonar by chris salt and turns in a very intricate remix released back in march dub sonar caused quite a stir due to very strong support and for this release we see australian producer a man who has not put a foot wrong it may seem in the last year luke chable turn in a quirky but driving remix the track begins intricately with a soothing intro of delicate sounds shortly before a big strong kick drum comes in quirky melodies riddle their way into the track almost building towards something and slowly but surely midway in we see some delightful melodies sizzle alongside a deep driving baseline reminiscent of ride it s another sinister remix by chable let me tell you on the flip we see rising talent chris salt put his remix hat on for the main element classic delta of venus again salt does not disappoint as he turns in a beautiful piece of melodic breakbeat that is riddled with spine tingling melodies tough driving beats and deep low end grooves featured on the anthony pappa balance release it is clear to see why this track demands such respect a very positive release here for and the first of a two part special that celebrates the 50 th birthday of this fine imprint
may be among the most underappreciated of detroit producers on some level though he only has himself to blame shy and unassuming grooves has rarely announced himself to audiences in the same way as some of the citys bigger personalities but over the past few years grooves has established himself as one of the most consistent producers releasing tracks on his own as well as the insta-classic coco brown which emerged on clone late last year has seen grooves get back to basics celebrating the 808 and here the 909 with a third release planned that will tackle the 606 as you might expect the sounds found on 909 are generated via the classic drum machine of which only around 10 000 were reportedly produced thus the key is in the emotions that grooves elicits theyre undeniable and for anyone who has listened to his work of late knows that he has no problem there even with his limited tools or perhaps because of them grooves builds a funky smooth ride that sounds completely timeless in both its classic form and the b-sides second mix which subdues the main melody in favor of atmospherics who also remixed 808 and his take on the track isnt exactly timeless but its nonetheless worthwhile the melody sounds almost as though its being scrubbed over its length panning its smeared contents as it does from left to right its just as sedate as the original if not more so but would more easily slot into dub techno sets than pure techno that said its hard to care much where it fits i could listen to it all day on its own

its a literary cliche that an author is only capable of writing one work the others being variations on the same theme applying this idea to music isnt difficult and if theres one producer whose output can be said to be truly autobiographical one whose sound is a distillation of disparate influences but who falls into said literary category its colin mcbean aka mr g the amazing thing of course is that mcbean has done this without displaying the slightest degree of stagnation from his early days as part of the kcc sound system to his partnership with cisco ferreira in the advent through to his current incarnation as mr g mcbeans music has been informed by a lack of compromise coming from a land where bass is the lingua franca his music is relentlessly confrontational yet simultaneously soul-tinged the devil is in the details: there is an analogue warmth that characterises all of mcbeans work that and clever eqing a restrained use of vocal samples and a distinct space between the sounds sure youve heard these elements plenty of times before but mcbean is a craftsman; when he makes things they just sound better than anyone else has dramatic low-end drops that seem to be inhabiting a haunted chasm its rolling bass rising and falling along with a soaring retro synth line slightly slower and moodier than most of gs output no 5 sounds like the soundtrack to a crack-addled episode of scooby doo - has even more lovely bass-heavy drops with a whiny siren going off in the background the only track that seems slightly out of place is the big city beats of moments but its a fitting conclusion and a glimpse into a parallel universe that will definitely tolerate further exploration theres a saying in football that the game is a simple one complicated by fools apply the same sentiment to house/techno and its no wonder that mcbean is still at the top of his game is primal tribal house as unproblematic as it comes
pender street steppers man jack jutson gave mood hut its breakthrough moment when he went solo with last years looking forward to you the music of the vancouver label is low-key and rarely draws attention to itself but the allure of jutsons languid deep house was just too sumptuous to resist since then the crews music has been popping up everywhere including another stellar 12-inch from jutson with steppers partner liam butler now almost a year to the day after releasing the last jack j ep jutson steps out on his own again this time for like-minded label primed for late-night summer parties thirstin is every bit seductive as its predecessor one of jutsons strengths is how his music comes off effortless and carefree without ever sounding disaffected thirstin is no different and its amongst the years most relaxing house jams the layered hand percussion feels weightless but propulsive and is well-appointed with muted instrumentation amplified by subtle dub fx and finished off with a catchy understated hook sung by jutson himself but the genius of thirstin comes down to his secret weapon: those zig-zagging basslines which are often more sing-songy than his melodic leads and thirstin gets a whopper of a disco bassline digging a path thats as fun to follow as the vocal as i recently saw its the kind of thing thatll rip a set a new one in spite of its laid-back disposition the instrumental atmosph re sounds like a dub version of an original tune we have yet to hear its focus is on some expressive piano playing while the funky rhythm section with a killer bass performance keeps things interesting underneath the songs clean lines and unencumbered rhythm make it sound a bit like steely dan trying to make an early house track recalling looking forward to you s keen ability to cobble together era-spanning touchstones into something cohesive and coherent thirstin makes the blend even more seamless delivering two groovy timeless tracks set to dominate summer just like his solo ep did last year
when youre pressing up 10 inch records in quantities of 300 you can afford be a little divisive nd thats surely be the case of the latest single from s ckholms label particularly its side by newcomer ts just a lark really taking a well known r singers rendition of foreigners 1984 power ballad looping a single vocal phrase ( cant s p now ) and adding a slow motion r groove and glowing juno style synths ts similar in spirit the narcotic edits of daniel lopatins (oneohtrix point never) sunsetcorp project particularly his nobody here essentially a single loop of chris de urghs lady in red s edit is cheeky certainly non essential but wouldnt call it insubstantial; my only quibble is that it begins with a full verse of the original undercutting any potential surprise fac r (on the other hand its a refreshing departure from the standard edit reveal which drops a full phrase of the original wards the end of the song as a kind of punchline ) korn l kov cs 92 is also an edit this time of a sultry r single from 2000 f you know the song youll recognize it immediately here but kov cs definitely isnt trying be clever; he makes the most of the breathy vocals and back masked guitars turning in a genuinely sensual mid tempo house cut that sounds a little like john talabot remixing craig david the stubby bass and tuned m melodies lend a fleet sense of movement and the swirled vocal loops and buoyant pads keep the mood light as a feather pillow t is a bedroom jam after all
back in 2010 nocturnal sunshine was the feather in maya jane coles cap projects impressive dubstep-inspired hit cant showed that she was about more than just catchy tech house more crucially its popularity proved she wouldnt be a one hit wonder in the wake of the massive what y say t was also one of that years best dubstep tracks were talking the nebulous garage-y 2010 definition of dubstep here which made it disappointing to see coles virtually retire the project once she became a house superstar but three years since the last hint of a new nocturnal sunshine track the alias makes an unexpected comeback with a new full-length and even if a lot of this music mostly sitting around 138 bpm sounds like it could be five years old it doesnt sound worse for wear nocturnal sunshine is a reminder of an era when coles was still willing to throw this kind of thing in with deep house as often happens with big djs her musical outlook became narrower with time nocturnal sunshine then is the sound of coles finding her groove again and its a funky broken groove extra space in these tracks seems to have ignited a spark in her just listen to those dubby drum hits on a small flourish that adds enough personality to overshadow nearly everything shes released since her debut album in 2013 part of what makes nocturnal sunshine appealing is that coles writes music at this tempo the same way that she writes house largely abandoning the drop structure in favour of a more linear approach she powers the dubstep framework with a different kind of energy one that puts the emphasis on subtle changes rather than big climaxes that comes out best in the irresistibly silky synth lead that percolates through or the eye-watering bassline on ntergalactic which sputters and rumbles steadily throughout the song missteps of her recent past dont escape coles entirely just like on comfort she drafts in a couple of guest vocalists who fail to grasp the nuance of her productions makes sound like drab trip-hop while s vocal on is so affected that she ruins what could have been a fine garage number coles has never been a technically skilled singer herself but her whisper matches her music to a tee the way she fits into the busy groove of ts is enough to make you wish she wouldnt ask other artists to sing over her music revisiting a sound that isnt terribly fashionable five years later nocturnal sunshine is a hard move to pull off not least because it includes cant weighing down an album of ostensibly new material with something thats already been rinsed but maybe the point is that this sound has aged pretty well even that tune sounds great when it pops up in the records second half ts doubtful nocturnal sunshine is meant to signal a career shift t seems more like a gift for coles diehards the ones who have been following her since the beginning whatever it might mean shes in better form here than she has been in years
manchester label marks its inaugural release with the debut 12-inch from netherlands newcomer together the upstarts present a focused and enticing vision of rough hardware-centric dance music with a druggy slant with charismatic touches like on-the-fly mixing and a complete disregard for peaking levels outlines a producer whose well-honed abilities run the gamut from mystic acid-house to immersive techno without ever losing its collective coherence occupies a buoyant house zone on and the first of which cobbles together 123 bpm acid from the leftovers of a blunted ambient session goes further down that smokey rabbit hole to find half-remembered smears of melody and layers of xeroxed drum patterns and continues to dig deeper into obscurity after reaching the bottom has its fair share of spectral pads and noisy touches too but its all rendered beefy and uncluttered likely to highlight all the deep details at work in its low frequencies its an impressive slab of restrained techno that along with the sinewy stands out like a monolith because resists the urge to prioritize strangeness over clarity all aquatic synths sticky bass notes and stomping 4/4 couldve joined their ranks if not for the permeating noise that distorted blurry stuff can no doubt be engrossing but shines brighter when the haze clears out
is an anonymous techno project that started last year theres almost no information about whos behind it or what their motivations might be but apparently this is just one of many secret aliases from a well-known italian producer were told these aliases cover both house and techno and judging from the sound of 002 the second instalment in the series this makes sense the 12-inch features four tracks that are all cut from the same cloth as the first release big basslines dubby overtones and cracking snares but kick a lot harder 002 s a-side has the two highlights is the most emotive cut with a short hazy key riff looped over a driving beat while is similarly murky but more subdued the subaquatic dubbiness continues with followed by a nice counterpoint to the rest of the ep thanks to a few extra synth stabs the finale is more colourful than the other three cuts and adds some variety to 12-inch that should please djs who like their techno housey
for those who like their house chunky with a hint of french eccentricity thrown in for good measure this has been huge throughout the year really hitting home in ibiza during the summer an absolute stormer i cannot fault this track in any way everything is perfect about it the production is spot on and not over bearing with each element playing its part like the french footie (soccer) team should have done during the world cup the bassline could be likened to fabien bartez (i e a bit mad) with the main hooks (a tribal chant ohhhh ohhh ohhh ohhhhhhh ) and a delicious funky guitar making you reach for the lasers everytime i hope defected work their marketing magic sign for a few ep s and we don t end up with a one hit wonder is talented and one to watch for the future this month s dancefloor dynamite
tristen whose long these strings appeared last year on oskar offermanns white label gives a little back with the first release on his new vinyl imprint oth tracks are by offermann and fellow erliner moomin whom offermann describes as an old friend from his hip-hop days saying we kinda had that spirit in mind when we produced these tracks that may be slightly misleading: both of these tunes are deep brooding house music no breakbeats no four elements no fast eddie rapping just crisp drum machines and murky chords jacking along at a textbook 120 pm ut its also not a stretch to hear a hip-hop influence in particularly in the way they layer almost imperceptible soul samples filtered and massaged into a kind of opalescent blob that glows deep in the mix with muted vocal loops and demure complementary leads its a little like a cleaner version of enny lankos early 00s records for playhouse with 909s in place of broken beats counteracting the smoothness the hi-hats have been mixed almost uncomfortably loud but i think thats the point: between them and the equally biting handclaps this track is all about presence no matter how dreamy it might seem begins even tougher with searing hi-hats and a hard stubby bassline but resonant pulsing string loops take the edge off as they swell to fill the spaces in between where followed an almost jaunty four-bar chord progression rests its weight on a single pedal tone lulling you into a ruminative state so it comes as a surprise when a voice breaks in saying listen to the lyrics the phrase repeats and then the beats fall away leaving just rhodes and ride cymbal running free theres an extended spoken-word passage thats hard to make out and then without drama the beat kicks back in and were eased out the door in structure and mood alike its not a particularly radical track its almost a tool albeit harmonically richer and fuller ut like all well-made tools it serves its purpose with elegant simplicity
aka robert arnold brings a love of hip-hop to his house music although across five tracks on this ep the dresden producer actually works his way in and out of a number of styles on vibratin the moody analogue hum of the soundbed is speared by an intense acidic sturm and drang; arrives on a bed of jackhammer foundation-wobbling beats which ebb away on a tide of fluid deep detroit pads spiraling funk bass and a looped rhodes sample trangressions is penetrated by deep uv rays reminiscent of parrish bradock and wamdue project; an off-kilter pitch-bent synth motif wanders in and out of itself like a escher woodcut its then that ahem cuts loose is indonesian-influenced hip-hop strolling through its two-minute span with a mr scruff-style freako bassline that always appears one step behind on arnold samples us mor outfit three dog nights easy to be hard (as heard on serial killer flick zodiac ) lashing it to farty reversed bass and an itchy percussive loop

the nom de plume of producer marcus lambkin has long sought to inject a healthy dose of hipsterish humanity into electronic dance music this doesnt exactly make him an oddity at his label df but his primary technique fitting groovy beats with coke bottle glasses and a pocket protector makes his music stand out as one of the imprints cheekier acts nswering from s 2010 full-length from the cradle to the rave was actually not all that much in need of a slickening up space-age strings and an enthusiastically strange vocal hook added up to something far less dorky than its constituent parts but between motor city drum ensemble and occasional knife collaborator planningtorock has been made to sound about as popular-kid as we could ever expect him to stripping nswering down to an attitudinal bassline and hard-edged percussion mcdes remix gives us a track that bears very little resemblance to its source material though its difficult to even call it a remix all thats recognizable from the original is a sliver of the vocal its an excellent track showing us once again that mcde means business both planningtorock versions could be the work of completely different remixers: the remix places the vocals against a more dramatic orchestral arrangement while the remix the real star here thrusts them unfathomably far out in space

s prolific release schedule sometimes work against him having dropped eight eps in the last 18 months or so his most impressive moments are inevitably accompanied by a share of middling or disappointing ones the berlin-based brits first ep for largely falls into the latter category the records competence and streaks of charisma are hamstrung by a lack of genuine spark the title track begins on a promising note as a sturdy kick and febrile snare shuffle underpin hovering pads and a tough bass groove nothing much else happens for whats left of the track however is better and pays tribute to lozanos beloved early warp 12-inches with a sweet exorcist-style bleep melody which gently punctures the bassy propulsive scene midway through the vinyl includes two remixes of from the pick is his as it improves on the original with doomy weight and atmosphere the version is a whirring frantic drum tool thatll be of value to s
might be associated with the kind of dark droning techno pioneered by prologue but alex tsiridis and h seyin evirgren dont really play it safe or ever stay in one place adept at balancing the experimental with the functional their discography touches on all sorts of techno including on their excursions as originally an anonymous project put out two solid records for our circula sound but seeing no point in segregating their already diverse catalogue have since folded their other alias and started an label the first release on is diverse as ever a handy showcase for tsiridis and evirgrens unique grasp of techno dynamics take : it has a hard lunging kick pattern and theres a world of detail in the background sighing synths and lolling melodies give the track a thick flow that almost feels comforting the other two turn to darker corners a stark and spacious landscape loaded with spidery bass notes and springy organic textures cribs from the pages of peter van hoesen but closer really does the trick with rickety bass notes sputtering like a ball on a roulette table the kick pattern is steady and powerful but the melodys constant tempo change lends the music a hallucinatory edge without making it unplayable if theres anything that sums up s allure thats it
zo xenias develops with no sense of even slight surprise but some small amount of style nonetheless xenia from the netherlands uses her voice cut to pieces and employed in full over a mechanistic house throb with a jazzy sort of skip to the beat track takes on parts where the adds would seem to want to go clipped guitar some piano swirly filter breakdown etc until xenia is throatily singing variations on free yourself and embrace yourself jumpy quasi-antic mix of it is enough to make certain among us want to hear basement jaxx instead but alas a remix by mr squeezes the original into a barely recognizable vessel for noise and unexpected aggression with a welcome kind of mechanoid mystery at play sezer s remix takes the house aspect of the track and goes toward the gleaming while soundbalances plays toward bulbous tech house pastiche and von s flails around a sped-up beat poised and poised and poised for a blast explosive enough for better or worse to blow the air out of a room
for a duo as singular in sound as its rather fascinating to hear how three top producers can twist marcus henriksson and sebastian mullaerts excellent title track from their 2008 double album into something very much their own s original was the penultimate track on the first disc of and it sat there for obvious reasons: it rung out as the beginning of the albums denouement an exhalation after the previous ten tracks and their frenetic pace free of any such contextual concerns luciano pours the tune into his ever-identifiable tribal minimal lacquer adding bits and bobs along the way to give it a unique form sonic highlight here is undoubtedly when s original melody tentatively peeks its head out from beneath the groove eventually rising up to overpower everything in its path tolga s approach is similar but works at a slightly slower pace and with a vocal that might distract you from the fact that not much is going on at all given the effortless nature of the remixes accompanying it sounds like hes trying too hard here ultimately failing to step out of lucianos long shadow brendon moellers beat pharmacy moniker turns up for the final rework on the vinyl version of this package and plays up the originals cobblestone jazz-like qualities to the hilt like the trios greatest moments it builds slowly hinting feinting before unleashing its full cosmic funk excellent stuff
to be honest i think i might have been ruined by the moth/wolf cub 12-inch as much as i love the jazz-structure percussion and the lack of a real good part has often kept him from being a 10 for me the injection of burials economical drum programs and sharp eye for haunting hooks is what made that 2009 team-up so goddamn marvelous however is a record cable sans deadpool you know what youre in for liltingly disjoint vocal snips synth burbles musique concr te shuffles clacks and clinks jazz-structure percussion minimal low end its a clear formula thats served kieren hebden through five previous lps and a galaxy of remixes on this lp he eschews some of the circular structure that defined everything ecstatic and the aptly-named rounds in favor of a more linear add-a-new-instrument-every-four-bars plan he retains a bit of the nonlinear depth by stacking loops of unequal length so they slide over one another at an uneven pace recalling and recombining each other its a bit of a headfuck but if you dig my rocks back and forth youll dig it album highlight nicks an infectious mario bros coin sound and marries it a bj rk-esque wail wraps the whole thing in soft transporter-room ambience and serves it up nearly bass-free who can blame hebden if he lets the contraption run a smidge o long its charming for the most part the album fills out with chiming if forgettable material such as as a track its meh but as an example of nuanced processing applied live drumming its ps hebdens knob twisting has flattened the kick-snare pattern out the sound of marbles bouncing about inside a cardboard box pretty finisher can scarcely be called electronic its mostly acoustic music stitched gether with electronic means like 99 of recorded music we hear but tet has such a delicate hand with the scissors needle and thread that the track plays like a fennesz cut that somebody taped over a forgotten vini reilly guitar sketch the ostensible single is also the albums biggest misstep though its entirely forgivable the macroscopic design isnt at fault its tets micro selection of parts that brings the track down with an mor soul-ish sample a boring bass buzz and a drum kit that ventures a little o far in thievery corporation real estate it just leaves that thrown- gether 90s flavor in your mouth but sometimes the throwback-ism works really well o as in eyes an effervescent wisp of a track that recalls the skyward exhilaration each one of you reading this (probably) experienced when you first heard an underworld track remember when you felt like you were part of an actual generation with a collective ethos and good uk techno made you want go jogging in the rain well its like that
is half of welsh duo isl nd whose nokia ep mixed glossy panoramas and fractured aggression in the style of much current grime-related music his first solo release also for bristols label is an extreme outlier to that world and indeed to most others half-hour productions mix for radar radio outlined his style: loop-heavy and grounded in scuzzy techno and disco house but with a bash it together british mentality that yields unusual results which appears here as a single was the mixs highlight condensing its strange soup of ideas into a pop-dance shot with extremely addictive properties the tracks soulful sample and daft punk-like bassline would lend themselves to ibiza dance floors were the former not reedy and thin and the latter contorted with timestretching effects the effect is dysfunctional but extremely moreish the original version is less than three minutes long (another of s strange decisions) fortunately the single comes with a double-length extended mix its joined by remixes from affiliates and related artists and each reworks the original in the image of modern hybrid club music gage cant seem to make his version quite as euphoric as hed like to and finns r b frankenstein technique excellent in his solo productions feels slightly unnecessary here sudanims steroidal soca beat is more successful so much so that he soon discards the original sample to let the drums do their thing ll three tracks show more technical flair than s original but its his weird and wonderful earworm that burrows into the brain
produced as the soundtrack to an unrealized installation is a -minute track pressed as a one-sided 12-inch thats different to how rog rio brand o ak usually does things brand o often has an eye on the dance floor but is more exploratory followers will be familiar with its elements chopped vocals tense percussion and a stripped-down sensibility but there are also unexpected sounds like noisy passages that swell alongside loops and droning strings the pieces most interesting aspect is its movement through at least four distinct passages the first and shortest consists of vocals and synth hits and could be the intro of one of his club tracks but instead of kuduro syncopation evolves into a drumless acid cut it then eases into an anxious rhythmic cinematic jumble which transforms into a playful rickety dub with a clanking beat may not have been presented as originally envisioned but its provided an outlet for brand o to stretch out as an artist
ostgut ton sublabel started last year as a home for oddities and one-offs that dont fall in line with the stern aesthetic of its parent label after the industrial-strength house music of gerd janson and philip lauers tuff city kids collaboration the label strays even further from familiar territory with the in ep are the producer-singer duo of guiddo and mavin and this is their debut release: two starry-eyed modern disco tracks with something of the budget soul feel of early chicago house of course theres plenty of precedent for appeal with this formula but dont quite pull it off a cluttered arrangement and some distracting stadium-sized reverb put paid to in while the lascivious tale of dance floor seduction on suffers from clumsy second-language lyrics ( let us hook up / my cuckoo ) remixes of both tracks are supplied by rotciv founder of brazilian disco house netlabel mister mistery he manages to scrub up both sides reasonably well in just the manner youd expect: by toughening the percussion removing extraneous details and lengthening them to tantric proportions in particular is given a new lease of life by foregrounding mavins wispy melisma and tightening up the bassline still theres a fundamental shakiness of execution overall that makes these tracks largely beyond salvation

by moving away from s long running speicher series for their latest 12 inch and seem to have distanced themselves from that material two solo productions on find both label mainstays in a more serious mode than say transparenza or either side of speicher 2 you could draw parallels from this record to the 2005 stonker sky dumont rugged basslines forceful kicks dour tone but both of these tracks feel more self aware s is a moody slow burner using only a few gentle rhodes chords to offset the gnarled bass and quasi industrial drums follows suit with heavy low end drones and a steely kick snare combo but knowingly winks every time he drops a dopey melodic sequence or a signature sample nothing on could be called daring or ingenious but the record is a snapshot of two vets confidently wiggling out of their comfort zones
there are two very different cds here from germanys systematic label one mixed by label head marc romboy and the other by ny fashionista tommie sunshine tommie sunshine used to be a celebrity raver according to the stories he contributed to mireille silcott s rave america a thoroughly enjoyable book that i heartily recommend to anyone that likes reading about dance culture his mix betrays those roots american rave s unique character was its over-the-top hedonism and colourful candy-rave aesthetic and despite our living in a very different era that is the kind of picture that this mix conjures for me it could certainly be considered cheesy but it is cheesy in such a gleefully druggy teenage way that it becomes charming all the electrohouse clich s are here chanting jaded voices chunky off-kilter bass riffs but always married to a straight-ahead relentless rave sensibility booka shade s darko stands out as the most musically sophisticated moment but that ain t really the point here it s much more about the brutal amphetamine jack of john acquaviva and madox s feedback if i were a seventeen year old in a silly outfit and a head full of cheap ecstasy i d go nuts to this stuff and anyone who remembers being like that or who still feels that way could fall in love with this mix marc romboy gives us an altogether more tasteful take on the sounds of now indeed this has many of the big tunes of the year on it and is a great way to relive some of your peak moments of the m a n d y remix of damage is here as is claude vonstroke s who s afraid of detroit most audaciously romboy kicks off the mix with anthem of the year where we at a track that most djs would choose to put at the end of the mix (or the night) this actually turns out to have been an inspired choice as it grabs the attention from the off and leads neatly into the less immediate and more minimal early section of the mix with gui boratto s arquipelago being a delightful inclusion big synth riffs abound but used far more sparingly than on sunshine s mix and romboy takes us into deeper realms while keeping the energy level high by injecting big tracks where needed the middle ground is hard to defend but romboy hits it squarely and perfectly with this mix there are elements of everything here from the pop to the deep and its fun and varied to listen to while maintaining a good flow (apart from the glaring mis-step of putting phonique s stupefyingly dull the river immediately between damage and who s afraid of detroit most importantly there is a stunning climax with john dahlback s ooh oh i e giving a convulsive and energetic lead-in to the overwhelming intensity of radioslave s remix of deer in the headlights which will bring back pleasurable memories for many romboy s mix is a great way to remember the big club moments of and sunshine s has a particular if limited charm so in the words of kompakt tip
before the release of his 2015 album homesick charlie duff was associated with a range of scenes and sounds but the album marked a shift to techno since then duffs music has zeroed in on pure strains of the genre becoming more tense and functional as he tried out different peak-time styles weve already heard dub and detroit-inspired techno but released on henning baers manhigh imprint finds duff looking to berlins stern sounds each track is grey patient and monolithic while its not the most distinct brand of techno duffs production touches keep the ep from feeling routine the title track is hard and heavy with a steely bell loop muscular drums and enormous blasts of bass s bass squelches also stand out but theyre tightly wound into an anxious stomping beat is the eps deepest and most hypnotic moment speeding through a bleepy landscape with smooth magnificence goners no-nonsense rework feels stiff in comparison which highlights the potency of duffs cold rhythms
f you simply heard s 12-inch without any context you might think that it was yet another 12-inch jumping aboard the deep house bandwagon is almost a clich of the form what with a man muttering at the beginning about a heartbeat in the music the watery dub narcotic synths and the slightly funky bassline but it turns out that this is the actual template for the clich these tracks are from the mid- 90s their restrained deepness is now gold standard for many of the current drum poets making hay out of a bit of bongo timed perfectly to fit the prevailing mood you might call this 12-inch a cash-in if the originals weren t so hard to find and wasn t releasing this in such ridiculously limited amounts god knows why though and the 12-inch s two b-sides are also both expertly plotted tracks continues the restraint of the this time around a de rigueur echoing-into-space synth line and a disembodied diva vocal much the same again except this time it s got a techno tinge the beats are solid and the tracks are the definition of mid-set floor fillers that neither announce themselves nor kill the mood they re simply artfully constructed pushers that only reveal themselves as distinctive when played outside of a mix ll in all it s a really good new deep house release then except from ten years before it became fashionable gain

has a habit of sneaking up on you (think surprise party not creepy ) the slowness for which hes renowned is not just benignly hypnotic but rather lulling of a false sense of security in which even the most disinclined of dancers are at risk of cocking a groove a case in point: the first five minutes of mechanical schleps and gurgles on take you nowhere but inwards to the essence of the throb the different voices mimic each others momentum and like a newtons cradle for the ears its pacifyingly easy to listen to but then as submissiveness to marks hypno-babble reaches its most docile point he slaps a bass so big and fretless the sedated reverie comes to an abrupt end this in turn resounds with extra oomph thanks to your new-found appreciation for the throb wait as you might for a similar trick to be pulled from the sleeve of it doesnt come the setting of a nimble bass and brisk octave-jumping arpeggios is instantly more gratifying than the start of but whereas that track operated a reel-you-in stratagem this one simply bobs along unexcitingly content with its own niceness its the inaugural release of a label run by piers harrison and christopher galloway who remix under their roots moniker and turn in a dub version whose arrangement is stripped bare and the instruments are allowed to float in space lightly foiling but not outshining s sneakily heavy charms
its usually best to leave one sheets out of record reviews but something caught my eye in the one accompanying the promo for s new compilation released in conjunction with a label night at katakomben in the imprints hometown of eupen belgium glancing at it after spending some time getting my brain turned to goo inside the entirely twisted soundworlds found therein i was a bit surprised to see the words pop and club thrown around nonchalantly throughout the promotional text did they send me the wrong files had someone slipped something in my sandwich at lunch even by s standards its fair to say any label with a discography this heavy on madteo eps is likely to veer toward the weird the eight tracks (two per artist) found on are pretty far out but the more you listen the more you start to see what their press people are talking about: these are pop sounds put through the ringer of some appealingly warped musical minds a mysterious but likely dj sotofett related project moves from warmly unhinged ( ) to coolly stoned ( come back ) on his/her/whoevers kickoff tracks acido records dresvn who also contributed artwork to the compilation crafts a damaged interlude ( ) before settling into of a vaguely rhythmic and cheekily psychedelic impression of a spaceship stalling out who recently released his second cupp cave album on ramp recordings turns in a heavy dirge that sounds like a shackleton 45 played at 33 ( trap night ) and an afterhours drum circle in teslas lab ( ) occasional flashes of sunshine abate the overwhelming seasickness of belgian band s ; nulldip previously self released is only the catchiest most coherent thing on here if you discount all the drum machine non sequitors and nonsense melodies
the third release on come from swedish producers with the release includes mixes from martin h as well as a collaboration mix from martin h and subway baby the martin h remix is on the a-side and it works its way with some subtle synths the original vocals and a faint baseline underneath it all not a bad remix by any means but not that awe inspiring the subway baby martin h remix is perhaps less inspiring then the a-side with some tribal influenced drums and the vocals maintaining a pretty constant and not too imaginative flow a disappointing collaboration for me the original mix is probably the best mix of the lot with some bubbly melodies forming the highlights early on the highlights continue with some nice beats meeting the vocal and some great atmospheric pads that give this track a nice uplifting feel and even a cheeky retro feel late on all in all this release is saved by the great original mix that gives this release a bit of emotion and melody
this latest release from washington house label is a dark storming affair from a guy called who apparentely originates from sunny jamaica the track named switch it uses fantastic effected drums as the main strength of the tune its a driving affair with a simple vocal line and a sporadic drum loop a small breakdown mid way into the track is used and then comes back in with a subtle baseline not much variety within the tune but its effectiveness makes that irrelevant an impressive outing which has already been used to good effect by a certain john digweed on his kiss fm show check it out
theres a certain gravity to releasing a self-titled record midway through your career ts an act of purposeful image making whether or not thats the case with the canadian artists third ep for nyc it sure feels like it you could even consider it a reboot of sorts because the four originals here frame all the familiar elements barreling techno full-throttle drum breaks and foaming-at-the-mouth acid lines in a new and improved package a year after the jungle revival hit its stride shows that theres still plenty to be squeezed out of the much-loved sound a lot of sounds like classic virus recordings material at 130 bpm everything is huge and nearly deafening the drum bass dynamic is clearest in where sections of bright airy chords are overrun by passages of stampeding mayhem ts not quite that simple though: soon a scribbling acid line comes in and the whole thing transforms into full-on techno meshes those opposing impulses better pairing its lead-footed percussion with the kind of loopy synth you might hear in a ben klock track while beats the amen breaks back with gut-punching kick drums might be the records best track: careening into freefalls with blaring synths and volleys of breaks like some lost anthem from 1997 its certainly the hardest hearing the amen breaks rip a hole sideways through it is the eps greatest pleasure throwing captures the tracks otherwise hidden softer side for his remix turning the melody into a music box-style lullaby and keeping everything at an eerie calm

since the departure of singer james buttery s pastel-coloured synth pop has been lacking a central personality on foam island they replaced it with a political message no bad thing at all but its nice on this follow-up ep to hear their downcast songs once again rallying around a strong vocal lead title suggests bespoke collaborative methods and the songs live it out: two wildly different singers are made to feel at home in the universe on the stately new yorks turns the sort of somersaults the lads would never risk shes backed by what might be string and wind chords melted into odd drooping shapes; its a beguiling sound and the producers know it letting it overpower the vocal slightly on londons gaika sounds comfortable outside the gloomier surrounds of his security mixtape res something nursery rhyme-like about his sing-song multitracked refrains and the beat is dancehall imagined as a kind of ornate toy all cute wooden doodads and fetching paintwork for the rest of the ep were back to s own shy robot vocals hangdog is a pleasant rehash of ideas theyve explored elsewhere a loopy shimsung edit of foam island track amplifies the originals melancholy letting it sit heavy over the wafting synth tones and hiccuping clockwork beats
last year released an album with a cold and beautiful mood it was a striking release thats provided source material for a new collection of grayscale remixes released on digitally and as a double-vinyl release reworks soothing landscapes into a range of hissy club cuts beau and fotomachine both supply rattling techno material a l i e s artist restructures into a lo-fi throb while fotomachine who runs technicolour punches wide drums through s chiming melodies hieroglyphic s version of combines rickety swing with acidic textures and the originals sparkling synths machine ups the intensity on her version of but its still a slimy crawl record also contains one track that sits outside the darkness: a remix of from equiknoxxs gavsborg last year bird sound power introduced the jamaican producers unique dancehall to a wider audience even if this riddim isnt as adventurous its woody melodies and molten groove give an extra dimension
seinans tenth release is put in the reliable hands of its joint owner as his recent outings for kompakt extra and simple have shown andy graham has found the sweetspot when it comes to hitting a groove on this means creating a bassline with a tantalising hint of a classic george morels lets groove with a deep rumble as its bedrock folds in stretched echoey vocals pushes a hi-hat pattern upfront and lets that groove lock on and sit there on he opens the curtains and lets light flood in wrapping up classic acidic bass with jerking claps and sun-dappled pads in terms of mood sits somewhere between these two tracks cascading synths and a plaintive melody give it elegance but its most potent weapon is a jacking neo-chicago rhythm that cuts through it like a surgical scalpel its more persuasive evidence that is one of the uks most consistent house producers
most would probably agree that and craig smiths soul part ii was one of the defining tracks of the nu-disco movement at the end of the last decade graeme clarks profile surged in its wake after years of relative obscurity since then hes extensively toured hooked back up with smith for an album as 6th borough project and delivered an edits comp now the scotsman returns with his first original productions in over two years launching his imprint in the process inspired by his pre-revenge days in the glasgow-based band deportivo street team is four analogue-heavy tracks that were originally intended as frameworks for a new live project evoking the boogie swagger of word premieres share night a chunky bass-riff carries before an undercurrent of female vocals and acid strobes gradually surface to gel clarks typically full sound is deeper leaning closer to house than disco just about edging as the pick combines gruff sub-throttle with cosmic pads and a nice bump of 80s new wave decadence is formed of electro beats hi-hats and coarse modular pulses but feels like more of a breakdown than a standalone track

definitely one of the producers to watch for gets set to make his mark yet again with his on a sub label of french based hypnotic music after his brilliant maria rosa production on hypnotic this release on the sister label is just as strong with 3 very high quality productions on one slab of vinyl on the a-side is the title track aspiration affine this is a production with a nice techy grittiness a tough kick drum meets quirky effects that intertwine delightfully with an electro fuelled baseline as the track progresses the percussive elements noticeably increase in action until the track hits a uniquely constructed breakdown hi hats clatter away as melodic synth stabs go side by side with a deep baseline the furious beats come back into the track creating a mind warping late night set madness first up on the b-side is flip on the road another chunky house affair is on the cards with this killer production as smooth baselines roll for the most part combined with a quirky but subtle hook again the brilliant drum patterns of alex s work helps keep the track flowing smoothly as does the nice humming effects in the breakdown as well as the extremely subtle vocal samples that never really rise above the background of sounds millan does it again not to end there the b-side also features the twisted but brilliant joei d autrefois probably the toughest of the three productions the drums needless to say are of high quality as millan utilises the high hats to great use industrial sounds flow relentlessly with the quirky drum patterns until it hits a purely evil yet devastating breakdown where killer evil synths tear away at the senses the drums come back into the action and twist and turn for the remainder of this purely peak time techno anthem this is some absolutely brilliant music from it s delightfully intricate at times sometimes funky and on other occasions purely satanic but it all adds up to create one of the finest release i have heard this year it is only the second 10 i have rated this year and both releases have had behind them and when i rate these releases 10 i am not quite saying that this music is perfect but rather that they are surely the best releases i have heard this year 3 fantastic productions in this one in particular make it very worthy of such praise watch out for because he is certainly making his mark as one of the finest upcoming producers
after well-received eps for renate schallplatten and im a cliche berlin-based israeli makes his first outing on with a mix of warm background textures and elegant percussion the title track announces itself as a bassy roller though the addition of riotous vocals and whooshing pads injects a generous dollop of fun that progression plus the unbroken momentum of its background bass groove makes it a gift for djs on the flip hits a flickering atmosphere that just about makes it the pick of the two rapidly blinking arps steady claves and hi-hats carry it forward and its beautiful mystic setting is completed by pillow-soft keys which curl upwards like illuminated columns of shisha smoke
art + sound is a pretty vague title for a set of 12 inch singles but in the case of sounds of universes three year old series it belies a tight aesthetic focus focus is impressive given the scale of the project which gathered on the new art + sound 2012 compilation stretches to two cds and some 17 producers of varying backgrounds and generations sometimes its clear how prevailing trends have shaped the series res balmy for instance was released a few months after his smash hit new for u but mostly art + sound charts its own path across the dance floor its hard to say exactly what binds these tracks together beyond saying the compilations early summer release date was well chosen on the first disc which gives tracks from the vinyl only series their first digital outing london group bllud offer up the fried afrobeat of over on the second disc which features entirely new material theres s all dubby sway and languid fuck the haters sentiment equally laid back are lden s heat warped and s sounds of universe are clearly drawn to producers like these: fringe artists who metabolise bits and pieces of dance music history in service of their own unusual visions elsewhere levels affiliate concocts bizarre industrial dub on and struggles his way through (the track isnt his best which is a shame given how perfectly something like d vation would fit in here) even as the compilation turns to dance musics heartlands it favours the mavericks: detroits for instance or chicagos jamal moss (who appears twice once in the duo ) both provide serviceable tracks but and steal the show with a pair of impeccable summer jams best productions here tend to be longer creating pleasant atmospheres to soak in s elegant rolls along for 12 minutes 22a label boss is scruffier but no less seductive on the nine minute closing out disc two continues the trend with a three track suite which makes its way from the trippy concr te of into a pair of bitesize hip hop instrumentals many of the artists here his music feels like its on the brink of cosmic lift off: it can be summery and friendly one minute and confrontationally weird the next art + sound 2012 has its weak spots but its a solid launchpad for trips into the unknown
in 2015 released the first of two eps inspired by dantes descent through the nine circles of hell as chronicled in the 14th century poem divine comedy the nine tracks on the the descent 12-inches were ominous takes on drone techno and industrial divine comedy described the center of hell as a frozen depth where satan was trapped waist-deep in ice at the end of inferno dante escaped the underworld; on s debut album the duo instead travel further into the frozen depths summoning evil at every turn across 13 tracks is a cinematic expedition through foreboding registers while the tempos across the album vary greatly (from the static air of to the sprinting ) the doomsday ambient pummeling industrial and tribal drums maintain a consistent mood swelling drones and rattling metal sounds seem as though theyre trying to escape the albums blackened surface for all of the doom on human touches emerge on most tracks is full of unquantised hand drumming on distant drums and a faint vocal cry are heard s percussion seems to step delicately around an ominous rumble s relentlessly dark music can get repetitive recycles the clanking industrial atmosphere of is much the same as the preceding track both set to a 4/4 march atop gristly drones woven with inventive interplays of drone and heavy percussion can evoke widescreen landscapes but the album ends up sounding surprisingly narrow the duo focus on darkness so insistently that they sometimes seem lost in it
australian multi-instrumentalist started out as a drummer but hes mostly known now as a singular guitarist hes a wizard of electric desert blues full of imagery and emotion and a first-rate improviser at that not only has he been releasing records for nearly two decades his list of collaborators over the years is a staggering whos-who of experimental music keith rowe peter rehberg otomo yoshihide keiji haino stephen omalley and thomas brinkmann are just a few of the artists hes worked with on his cast of co-conspirators is more electronic than ever with mark fell ricardo villalobos and keith fullerton whitman joining avant-garde staples like jim orourke and arto lindsay consists of two long pieces pt and pt that flank a two-minute interlude the palette cleansing pt the first and last tracks employ the steve reich method of stasis via perpetual motion especially seems to float in the hypnotic rhythm generated by layers of muted guitar and ringing harmonics uses the same rhythmic guitar layers as a starting point for fervent instrumental wilding first from drummers joe talia and will guthrie and modular synth master whitman then from lindsay and ambarchi himself on guitar is an oddly evocative lullaby of bass guitar melodicism with vocal fragments like a conversation overheard from another room its a testament to ambarchis arrangement skills that each contribution dovetails beautifully with s larger idea while still feeling individual if it wasnt explained who did what where even the most informed listener would have difficulty picking out some of the collaborative elements thats how well they embed within as a whole but what makes this record feel special is how naturally it moves to occupy a space between classical minimalism jazz rock and electronic music theres an admirable level of refinement to even as it also feels brilliantly alive and ever in the moment
having released the much-played walk on n and treptow on numbers this is s first release on his own label since 2012 finds him shapeshifting as ever his ear for a melody and abundant technical skill are among the only constants here two of the eps four cuts feature vocals from what s be is a dogged club groover that pairs s impatient vocal ( you know that want you / dont tease me / dont wanna play this game ) alongside melodious key flecks and skittering little background patterns quality control and variety remain high throughout the eps middle section channels crescendo-chasing disco and is pulsing acid-house that skitters winsomely on big sighing keys and a body-moving percussive rattle closer is a loungey quasi-ballad that finds in full-scale seduction mode and nonchalantly nailing it from yet another different direction
wavering bass that underlies siss remix of s the is just about all you need to know here its tense a little bit ominous and sounds ready to explode at any moment into something far more well anything siss greatest work so far has mined that idea the epic tease to great ends and while this is a much more refined affair than his previous euphoric moments for sei es drum and c cille it still works excellently in 2008 he sounded like samim here he sounds like efdemin kollektiv on the other hand sound exactly like themselves their two takes the duo embody connaisseurs self-styled genre tag for their work: emo tech core mix is the house version and they unspool the vocals and echo them into infinity while stretching the drama to its breaking point have a knack for the event and you can tell that this has likely soundtracked the finale to more than one of their live sets second mix however goes to even greater ends to look for feeling inside of the original y call it the mix which apparently means idm beats and naked moody pads its a nice enough effort and shows an eagerness to stretch out to different genres but are no telefon tel viv and it ultimately falls flat
cologne-based duo of george conrad and marius bubat aka complain about the restraints of making music purely for the floor we decided to do a pop album about club culture they said about in technicolor their debut album i shudder a little when i hear this kind of talk simply because at this stage that very dichotomy between the dance floor and pop is a false one what matters is not whether a production works in a particular physical or metaphorical space but how it could work the space in technicolor spends a fair bit of its time trying to straddle those spaces to varying degrees of success s approach to sound and structure is smart theyre always savvy enough to know when to lift things to the next level has a fantastic disco key-change that pulls the breath from your chest similarly touched by disco spins on a simple clap-and-arpeggio pattern which slowly mutates part mororder groove part electro strip-lighting but they dont always get it right latino percussion in is submerged too deeply in the mix moments of character like this need to be foregrounded not painted into a corner sometimes you hear their indie roots a little too clearly recalls new order riding a peter hook bassline while ringing synths drip melody across the surface but the vocals on this one arent strong enough a problem through much of the record: for a pop album the singing is pretty insubstantial single suffers a similar fate it starts regal and majestic but perfunctory vox bring it crashing to earth tellingly when focus on the floor near the end as they do on they really nail it as a result the final quarter of the album significantly elevates the whole in technicolor is a hard one to figure out too much of the album feels restrained unable to truly revel in the bliss of melody res also nothing here quite as compelling as their earlier eps where songs like raindrops stretched out to an eternity lovely and languorous in the end i spent much of my time with the album willing the duo to just go for it and have a truly pop moment
frances answer to funky electro-fused breakbeat is and this newcomer has already made waves with his machine noise release on heavy disco records for his debut on records delivers a frenzied effects driven monster on one side and a double-take of funky beats on the flip side a just the fx starting off with a funky breakbeat youd be forgiven for thinking this is your average run of the mill breaks tune as it quickly progresses and incorporates element after element of razor-sharp electro effects funky vocal stabs and big speaker rumbling basslines it doesnt stop there either as the effects build upon themselves with variations thrown in the big breakdown in the middle is completely comprised of effects electro stabs and a deep male vocal which constantly repeats just the fx proper dancefloor devastation which has been tried and tested side b1 burnin on a slower and deeper tip is burnin which keeps things breakbeaty yet does not lose s electro appeal the original version treads between the realms of rocky breakbeat and electroclash with a massive bassline big electro slices and a sweet female vocal during the breakdown during the main verse incorporates a big 80s sounding rock guitar lick into the tune which gives it an interesting feel perhaps not for this reviewer im afraid side b2 burnin (electro mix) no surprises as to what style of tune this mix is but its important to note that the vocal lick from the original has been passed through a vocoder and the bassline is sweetened by a bouncy synth and is given a new melody to sing the tune is accompanied by telephone rings dubby/echoey percussion and more variations on the vocals from the original i must say that i havent been completely taken in by the electro thing but this has got me sold its even better than the original
the social dissatisfaction expressed by black dog in last years further vexations continues with a concept album exploring the dichotomy between the reality of airports and their ideal: places of numbness and vacancy as opposed to futuristic gateways to the world album forms one half of an art installation with the physical half being done by a group of interactive artists called human whose projects include video material at 00 s miami wmc some will recognise the albums title as a throwback to brian enos similarly ambient (but less rhythmic) music for airports : is black dogs reply to that record which they regard as inaccurate in its mood of hope and serenity and while most of it was actually recorded and written over three years while waiting for flights in airports on tour the picture painted is a bleak view of the way that airports tend to reduce us to worthless pink blobs of flesh as the press literature puts it however is only one of a range of angles taken the album is broadly a palette of emotions evoked by the airport experience disinformation for example builds morose pads and reverbed drum hits into a looped tension which suggests that they see airports as the embodiment of societys ever-accelerating spiral downwards into chaos and inhumanity but while its true that the overarching message is a desolate hopeless one theres far more to it than that; there are few acts that would be able to deal with such a lofty thesis with this amount of poise oppression ( ) limbo ( ) and tragedy ( ) are some of the moods we travel through guided by slow brooding pads and razor-sharp percussion it never settles into a tedious pattern though broken by tracks such as whose lush beauty somewhat bewilderingly suggests emergence and sad reflection at once the two tracks are very deftly executed numb and devoid of feeling with only sleepless purgatory left tick-tocking along a more straightforwardly impressionistic approach is taken in places being a recording of a noisy departure lounge a mish-mash of childrens shrieks and general bustle shot through with digital zaps a scene thats rotten and faulty at its core but the thing which really elevates the previous collection of songs into something greater is the last track which wraps the package into a whole by exiting the airport relieving listeners of the heaviness that preceded it and offering a sort of tear-jerking reflectiveness that seems to ask where do we go from here ideally this would be a background to the situation of humans installation but even without that has plenty to say its challenging and accomplished in equally large quantities and hopefully as happened in the early 0s an example of a deeper form of art that will be followed by others
next up from wallop recordings comes a track from jonathan espinosa and mike sinnott aka this production duo also produce under the name pleasureseekers having recently being signed to sandy riveras blackwiz imprint theres two edits of the original mix is on the b side bringing together a clutch of tribal percussion and swirling vocal samples that filter about and an incessant pace sweetened with big room stabs scattered throughout beats drop out repeat and keep the motion while gradually things strip back bringing to the fore airy pads and the vocal for a high dosage breakdown the stathis l remix is on the main side comprising of chunky house beats and neat percussive patterns along with a string of delayed fx and wet rhythms creating a dark mood gurgling about underneath filtering in places bubbling out of this comes an aggressive bassline and steady build back up using seething elongated sounds together with subtle tribal workings
theres a passage on s from his debut that shows the cologne producers greatest strength the drums are so punchy and so central to everything that its possible to enjoy on those sounds alone the production is crisp like a new white shirt with an arpeggio whose simply tailored sequence dazzles but the track also exposes a major shortcoming with a guitar-like synth melody thats stiff and plain bangs but it doesnt sing another problem across is an excessive dryness the blistered drums of especially could use a drink as a set of bare club tools much of the ep will do the job but kessler has worked around these deficiencies with more promising results new york baby released by get physical in 2014 found some musicality in the slippery vocals and a few complementary tones 2015s say hey was weirder and even better the calloused snare rolls rattling across the stereo field and the cold distressed synth notes showed an impressive mastery of dynamics has its moments like the plastic piano breakdowns in or the merging of live and synthetic textures on but only the title track is a match for kesslers best work for its tumbling drum avalanche it might remind you of capricorns 20 hz that track was so much fun because of the idiophonic jingle snuck in with capricorns percussive stampede like a bow tied to a tank is a joy but a transient one

nother day another anonymous artist or maybe make that anonymous given that is also the title a recent song by krikor a parisian artist with plenty ties to and judging by a stray reference on ivan smagghes blog its tempting to assume that krikor is indeed responsible they dont particularly sound like anything were accustomed to hearing from the man but thats neither here nor there his catalog after all runs from shambling cut-up digital funk to moody eccentric art rock speakwrite is the comparatively uptempo jam here its not actually that speedy clocking in at around 116 pm but its got serious muscle with gnarled bass riffs and dissonant blips driving things forward and a hair-raising wildpitch ostinato over the top the melodic focus is a series hard glassy chords that might be guitars yet its hard to say; they swat hazily about like fists underwater theres a spoken-word vocal too ut this time at least it speaks in more specific terms than the usual kumbaya platitudes if listening to music is going to be an increasingly lonely activity that we do with ourselves to ourselves says a pr essorial sounding voice then were going to miss something very important about being human you know the ability to get together and do something as a community in real time whether you encounter it in erghain or on hype machine the track makes a strong case is far less aggressive but its just as physical with cleverly processed 808s and swirly power corruption lies -style synthesizers huffing along at 110 pm; it comes on like a blast air and surging chords and a tangential solo midway through only make it more intense its rare that songs this slow have so much visceral power in the context the above quote it feels almost like a challenge to djs to step outside their comfort tempos
it must be nice to be trusme right now with a raft of producers clamoring to work for his imprint and remixers ready and willing to tackle tunes already released his only problem is having too many things to release his solution thus far has been a canny one taking the best bits from producers and offering them up on compilation releases that have showcased only the finest that both the artist and label has to offer that tack is taken again on and it leads off with the biggest name ) on the side remixing one of the few artists to garner a full fledged solo release on ( ) move takes rmour into his deep house wheelhouse building the atmosphere for nearly seven minutes via echoed dub splashes and a mild mover of a bassline its yet another solid effort from the producer that falls neatly in line with his recent house work duo of lesser known artists hold up the b side in quality fashion with werk associate ctress offering up the quickly paced soulful house loopfest (thick synths vinyl crackle and a pounding kick are all this consummate j tool needs over the course of three minutes and change ) on the other hand slows things down considerably dropping down past 110 bpm for the track builds a wonky groove out of a spray of organ cymbal and hand claps until three minutes in when everything stops and a dreamy interlude takes over its a beautiful moment and one thatll have crowds either applauding the j or cursing them depending on the context for home listening purposes its clapping all the way

supplements facts how can you sleep at night raises more tricky questions than just its title asks: have you ever wondered why it is that we love this music yeah sure but the more pressing question is: why are stock pitch shifted druggy vocals needed here given the right setting they can add a perfectly sweaty sheen of nastiness but would have easily found the grime left to their own devices the dark bleepy tech house serrated dubs and hollow banging sounds of tunnels down into deep warped territory of its own accord and the overly loud commentary that accompanies the trip down the rabbit hole is distracting at best how many cooks is too many cooks the case of its the seven ( ) producers of superstar cast guti soul clap le loup greg paulus shaun reeves and tanner ross that are responsible for this oversalted broth friendly diplomacy in the booth may be to blame for allowing run of the mill soul man chants and a cringeworthy refrain of paaaid / laaaaid to hog the spotlight when its redeeming qualities really lay in its chicago roots and the wordless vocal melody that pipes up later can describing something as perfectly fine ever be considered complimentary i dont know but its a phrase i cant move past with lways s first outing for the label perhaps if hed dropped anchor a little earlier and allowed the bass to sink in before the five minute mark its delicate vocal treatment intricate melodies and barely there deep house bongos would leave more than a pleasant but featureless impression these tracks will no doubt find sympathetic ears but personally ill opt to spend more time in the company of guy gerbers /hate and see what comes next
give ralph cumbers k this much: he got title his newest -side exactly right james lawrence dance blog the veal pen refers to as rave-step and while that may be a step too far for anti-neologist brigade (or worse res only two kinds music good and bad bores) it sounds exactly right to me the clanking oscillating synths and garbled diva samples are chopped and presented fresh like steak tartare the beat keeps shifting but never feels willful snares ricocheting over oscillating filter envelopes like an airplane starting to shake the bass is forceful enough to rough you up and measured enough to make you pay attention the track is candy-colored and menacing always a smart combination is a more obviously future-forward track meaning that low-end roll slivered diva croon and craggy trapped-under-ice snare all feel like a bionic version something from five years ago instead 20 its a cool weird one: spongy metallic synths seem to enter from oblique angles even when y recur regularly and robo-soul vocal adds real feeling however show- fy its processing whats more both sides feel like halves a conversation which happens less ten than it ought to

though many uk producers in the past year have been making moves towards explicitly retro chicago house londons has set his sights on something more continental than the windy city he hinted at it with the taut techno-informed grooves of last years wavey ep and goes full-bore on his first release of his debut on just like bax last year has been getting a considerable amount of dubplate hype perhaps surprising for such a straight-laced house track but the proof lies in the tracks deepest nether regions: s brand of tech house doesnt lack any of his previous musics considerable low-end impact and rides suave and nimble kicks over a tectonic bassline that thuds and skips underneath the kind of thing that might weigh down any other producers tracks couple that with throwback rave samples and a deranged lightheaded chord progression and it wiggles into a loopy banger striking an uncommon medium between tracky and anthemic takes the bottom-heavy template and drops an anvil on it a pseudo-techno writher repurposed into bouncy broken house bleats his signature phrases all over the track lending the throb a layer of pop that turns its low-end from menacing to hot creations-esque sleazy also goes the vocal route as an uncredited uk vocalist armed with a lighthearted croon duels with the tracks dulcet mallet melody working with vocalists for the first time conquers yet another genre with another accomplished release
once compared the sound he loves a spark of euphoria in a track thats moody as fuck and the emptiness that follows to stepping from shelter into the rain the ambient the artists latest ep seems exposed to the elements s procession of field recordings footsteps clock ticks respiration rushing water though coated in a familiar crackle feels naked and disordered without rhythm even though some sounds gesture to it there are occasional claps and a tentative toy melody later we get dialogue all thats left is the procedure and the bleep of a stopwatch many details emerge but few say much were marking time stumbling in the dark reminds us of s emotional potency in a way that s sample collage does not choral vocals glide in various pitches from angelic registers to wails that resemble gregorian chants chimes act like chapter breaks signalling gentle changes in tone or mood while wind and thunder break the silences conveys sacred spaces places of worship and natural landscapes with a clarity that illuminates s inner world on he sounds lost in a void

the first single from s forthcoming debut album wicker steel does justice to the albums title with an unusually tactile approach to techno and an unusually stark one as well six minutes of mortar blasts and a ringing in your ears its harrowing: apart from the regular kick drum the music has been stripped of technos usual crutches everything floats free around the faint 4/4 vertebrae and with more space between the beats you hone in on the particulars of every element the wide-open train whistle the crumple of struck metal ancient go at their remix like a charcoal rubbing filling in the empty spaces with droning growling synthesizers and emphasizing the beat in quick violent strokes theres an echo of breakbeat hardcore in the groove but the idea has more to do with the clanging percussionist zev the other remix comes from chris of throbbing gristle and chris and cosey fame hes been turning up with increasing frequency in the contemporary electronic scene with a recent reissue on optimo and remixes with cosey fanni tutti for excepter from the sound of things here he understands techno better than most of the producers currently associated with the genre drawing out skeletal drum patterns and staccato synth tones over just a hint of a downbeat he achieves more genuine tension than the most ashen pummeling by-the-numbers industrial techno cut while nagging tri-tone riffs and nervous 16th-note patter stretch out like electric filament the proportions of the thing blow out like soft glass its the head exploding as viewed from inside in perfect crystalline stop-time motion

s waves of sound are so monstrous they could crush you on their recent album borders they experimented with homemade instrumentation and a more human touch but the results were no less noisy they shed digital production on for an acoustic ep that shows how much more ground they have left to explore theres a clearer and less overwhelming sound to the four tracks which all consist of the same elements: a custom-made string instrument and a hand drum in the background and are the most impressive tracks the former works itself up into a storm that equals of any of s electronic works the droning minimalism teases out another layer of the groups music beyond its toothy attack and are slower and more methodical letting you hear each string ring out while savouring the startling feedback that comes with each stroke ts a jarring sound that feels wrong though focusing on the reverberations of acoustic noises makes their most ambient work its still fearsome showing that the groups style doesnt only come from machines and computers

the opening minute of appears to find xeno oaklanders sound unchanged the duos old drum machines and synthesisers once again form a conduit for their ice-cold chemistry liz wendelbos blank-faced euro-accented vocals continue to recall the automatons of minimal wave and synth-pop obscurities moments later during the first major key change of the soaring opening track the hallmarks of their angular rain-slicked sound suddenly flicker into full colour xeno oaklanders move from their brooklyn home studio into a professional space created by talking heads alumni tom tom club seems reflected in the spread out feel on they exploit a wider spectrum of synthesiser capabilities than ever before from juddering industrial sequences to instrumental and beatless compositions that point to an appreciation of incidental soundtrack music also reveals a talent for warmly approaching the songcraft of electronic pop showcased dazzlingly in every pause and reprise feels well-earned each time the melody is unleashed by the chorus it swoops a little higher and the crescendo finish is in no danger of being gloomy wendelbo is left to her own devices as the frontperson and in the absence of the usual boy-girl vocal dynamic with sean mcbride she teases some subtly different personas out of her vocals at its weightiest the total mass of wendelbos voice is still comparable to a cloud of mist her feathery edges and ageless quality complement the majority of s vocal tracks whether it be the focal point or woven in as a tonal instrument beautifully places her at the centre of a widescreen view of shadowy detailed synth-pop which progresses at a slow pace despite its fidgety tempo on the other hand aims for bold dark romanticism and falls short into schlock horror the songs powdery hi-hats dramatic chamber-pop atmosphere and sing-song verses call to mind the cheesiest 80s music video clich s: dry ice backlighting and slow-motion birds flying against a night sky s instrumental pieces work as mood enhancers and cinematic pause particularly on the two title tracks the albums remaining high points are on songs like where ruthless editing has been applied to the uniformity of the duos previous albums with its prominent bassline and measured doses of rapid fire drums owes a lot to new orders blue monday is such a classy and understated take on electronic pop that junior boys ought to quiver with envy its sparse delicacy is precise and clean simmering and intensifying incrementally towards its symphonic conclusion in the same way that follows expansive and hopeful songwriting into a moment of pop brilliance benefits when xeno oaklander let go of their dystopian aesthetic and choose emotion over mood
f anyone is still describing as some classical version of raftwerk its time to stop german trio once dealt in austere minimalism but on their icks mix that sound has been jettisoned in favour of heavy eclectic acid fried funk think: house and techno by way of flying lotus s icks shows the german trio rifling through 8 tracks like music nerds excitedly sharing new records with friends mix has an arresting non linear flow (rhythmically it jumps from to choppy breaks and into slippery broken beats) but there is little artistry in the transitions nstead its just a bunch of tracks pretty much laid out as is: bang bang bang res nothing fundamentally wrong with that of course especially when you have s taste and sense of curiosity mix covers a lot of interesting distance between for instance the politically charged funk of cult nigerian artist s (one of those grave spoken word techno tracks that asks you to consider the meaning of your life) the glossy synthetic funk of s ns (a tribute to dusty latin funk and scratchy ska 7 inches) and the drowsy soft focus piano house of s beautiful further seasoned with high grade techno ( ) and moody bass music ( ) s contribution to the series while not a classic is still a little treasure trove
is a label with an omnivorous diet when it comes to dance music but its catalogue has a strong british flavour loefahs woman / midnight is a notable example but the release of cousin cockroachs this aint tom n jerry and return to e remix by horsepower productions had already established label boss gizmos fondness for uk dance music is a nod to this tradition via the gunshot grime snares of koehler and kunos original but it foregoes the velocity of its ancestors instead the track canters through a rhythm carved out of laurie anderson-style gasps and an acid line thats as smooth as a crooners slicked-back hair its a fun dj tool but its repetitiveness shows its limitations a one of dance musics most reliable remixers overhauls the beat by lining up some simple latin jazz keys and tying the tracks croaking acid line around a moody synth sequence its an unusually understated revamp from dave huismans his other remixes tend to be stuffed with library sounds and sub-rhythms but the empty spaces of the original are only sparsely furnished here adding just enough to the mix to make it work

of the romanian big three rhadoo petre inspirescu raresh it seems rhadoo takes the idea of aliases most seriously hes used at least five in his 20-year career most just a few times (the bucharest resident is hardly a prolific producer either with just a handful of 12-inches and a batch of remixes under his belt ) the sound of each moniker is distinct perhaps testament to the effort that goes into differentiating them the rhadoo name for example has typically been an outlet for his most straightforward and low-slung work while adsum a relatively recent addition is percussive and light-hearted colorhadoo is the latest alias it arrives with the ep a three-track 12-inch for cristi and vlad caias label the records key difference is a strong focus on psychedelic sounds exemplified in the 13-minute its s standout built with a half-time beat and a collage of warped vocal snippets synths chants and reverb most of rhadoos music is trippy but a track without any focus on functionality is on another level it would be risky to pull it out at a party but its easy to imagine the cinematic atmosphere working its magic there are two more obvious dance floor cuts to choose from cristi reworks into a functional bass-heavy roller while the brightest track here makes use of a warped melody and a stomping groove they round off a delightfully varied ep
the next release on the imprint the sister label to silver planet that showcases the future production talent of our world gets ready to unleash the talents of and his latest production entitled first up is the original mix and in a short sentence it s an emotive piece of beautifully constructed breakbeat nice delicate beats begin the production surrounded by eerie sounds and effects the track builds delightfully until nice baselines start shaking the foundations foundations that are soon joined by absolutely stunning string patterns that really work brilliantly with the surrounding sounds once the strings come in the track continues to change shape and build upon itself creating a truly unique experience on the flip chris micali turns in his remix and gets the familiar 4/4 beats back into gear nice chunky drums set the scene for the first half of the track as subtle melodic patterns and smooth effects work themselves into the loops the track hits a nice breakdown pretty late on seeing melodic overtones meets a smooth bouncy baseline that leads into the conclusion of this pretty good reworking i must say i quite like this release it is not often you hear pretty uplifting records that aren t overdone and obvious and this record is far from that
res a whole lot going on in the debut ep from aka londons yemi olagbaiye across four tracks he squashes in lush pads sax solos cut-up jazz drumming hoover bass piano glissandi skipping garage hi-hats and rimshots down-pitched voices etc while it shares the moody inclinations of a lot of dubstep-not-dubstep since burial its way busier than a lot of its brethren preferring to come off as manic than merely polite but its a soft opulent kind of chaos you can hear an echo of amon tobins influence particularly in the churning drums of the title track and the walking bass of ; aphex twin and feed me weird things -era squarepusher both come to mind in with its majestic pads and breakneck breaks mandy an atmospheric garage tune at 140 bpm manages to stake out a position between flying lotus and faltydl how well it all translates to the dance floor is a different question awash in luxurious textures the gauze sometimes obscures the not inconsiderable muscle but you get the sense that the sunrise of the title is a reference to the period after the clubs doors have closed when the mind continues to race unfettered by more narrowly functional concerns

winter has arrived; a time for audio retreat nto that indoor withdrawal fittingly arrives the second full-length of the tibetan-swiss producer and eerie chanteuse scant six years after her debut album for mental groove reflections of the dark heat wax returns with her first lp for with a little audio aid from label head james holden fter recording the album in switzerland wax headed to london to mix the album in holdens studio unsurprisingly the resulting record bears not only the trancey arpeggiations and deep night atmospheres of holdens own productions and mixes but the frontiering sonic expansions of bc crewmembers like luke bbott and ricardo tobar but for all those surface similarities waxs album is also unlike anything else the labels ever been associated with occupying the same wind-howl climes of artists like fever ray or planningtorock is a record of almost gothic stateliness and remove ts the kind of album you cant help but hear as some alt-universe soundtrack to john carpenters thing unlike the daytrip electronica and warm hobo techno around which the labels formed its band theres a distance to the sonic bedding here as though wax is most comfortable from the other end of a telephone line for example opens with waxs treated vocals sort of drizzled over slow piano stabs and spliced vocals constructed around empty and dimly-lit places while moves from one of holdens trademarked arpeggiations into an arcing vocal line thats somehow pleading and desperate but still remote top soft squalls of dissonance and glass clinking meanwhile is like a creepy torch song transmitted from some german industrial wasteblock while the sonic restraint that opens track five gives way to a stumbling percussive break that inverts the joyousness of kate bushs hounds of love into a cold claustrophobic stomp that said little of bounces like classic mining a trend set by standouts from the last few years like coloured in memory and holkham drones its rhythms are understated not backbones but appendages re are still those moments of push though especially on the albums second half and they help to offset some of the records gloomy introspective crawl rides another of holdens warbling heat-dizzy synthesizer runs through a fuzzy martian landscape and a folds a subtle electro-strut into offsetting tonal patterns and one of waxs most untreated and affecting vocal performances on the album and stumbles through a choppy mistimed beat and talo synth into waxs exotic drawl mouthing unknowables as forlorn and lost as the backing track: she has come with a little gun / beast is clever huh succeeds for the elegance and foreign ambience of its wintry atmosphere; its easily the strongest effort yet from an artist we might easily have assumed had moved on to other ventures s yet another attempt by holden and co to expand bcs sonic terrain its a bold and often bewitching effort new album from is a rare treat indeed after all; holds enough unexplored pockets and moments of sly intrigue to hold us for the labels next endeavor

the lesson to be taken from the first retrospective is that you know - and love - a hell of a lot more records than you think you do over the past year the uk-based label has quietly been churning out a stream of no-nonsense dancefloor anthems the kind of unremittingly physical tracks which crowds everywhere respond to instinctively - indeed the only way the cd of originals would make more sense is if crowd cheering noises were inserted periodically are unashamedly all about the bangers earwoom hooks insane rave noises which make crowds go oooh and aaah and simple dumb repetition are the order of the day here; each track locks itself swiftly and with the barest minimum of fuss into an infectious groove and cheerily remains there for eight or so further minutes ehts noch-ing its way into your brain its an unsubtle strategy and it works because the hooks are so great: s for example is an extraordinary machine of a track screaming high end giving way to a riff which sounds like household appliances malfunctioning various deranged noises ping-pong around s the baton constantly being passed between low-pitched whistling gibbering treble and metallic bouncing sounds its also surprisingly varied sure the signature sound - grinding drawn-out sounds married to languid tempos an effect which makes the tracks feel simultaneously menacing and decadent - is omnipresent; but the variety of ways in which it manifests itself is wide enough to ensure that it never becomes stale theres the dry clicky tech-house of s ; udiofly s smooth pristine which wouldnt feel all that out of place on et physical; s harking back to the electro-house which dominated 2004; and possibly best of all the deep funk and vocal samples which constitute the cd of remixes is less consistently magnificent - the gang have always been better remixers than remixees possibly because the immediacy of their originals means that any meddling inevitably lessens the tracks impact but prins s disko-tek miks of s is a triumph elongating and stretching it out into something even more blissful bringing its latent italo tinge to the forefront the partial rts take on too is satisfyingly chunky and percussive
you know where you are with or at least you usually do ouncing main room techno has been her stock-in-trade but might be her toughest darkest music yet over its ten minutes she works her magic to summon a gathering storm that by its end reaches tempest proportions the opening minutes are characterized by brutal kicks and an ominous background rumble s time passes the elements stack up from diabolic synths to spitting hi-hats youll do well to find a moment to catch your breath offers some respite lacking the choking intensity of the previous track its beats are turned down from pile-driving to merely rattling moudaber folds in the slightest amount of vocal breathy and looped which is later joined by crashing metallic percussion that sounds like a storm-battered roller door
welcome day-tripping audion fans to a strange place mouth mouth-ers might have suspected something was up when they drifted across recent single and will most likely leave them baffled but for dear aficionados who have been waiting four years for something of this particular ilk a treasure trove albeit slightly flawed and surprisingly personal - awaits second time around theres more to explore in both music and words from opener the the emphasis on the voice the message its apparent dear has spent a considerable slice of the past 48 months - well the time he had left after making music as audion false and jabberjaw - thinking and learning about song structure as a result he wears some of his influences a little too candidly the study hasnt been a total success the hazy lovely as it is is something of an odd choice for a lead single: the charmingly na ve lyrics are eclipsed by most others here or maybe thats the point a fool in love other outings are either surprisingly revealing or pointedly complex he blows hot and cold the searching he offers theres a big hole in my life ; on the bluesy stomp s the couplet i can see the future shine/this is the beginning of time sound like an optimistic enough view on a relationship but given his pained yelp of a delivery you cant be sure over the brilliant syncopated stabs and tight snares on and sheri we hear his half of an argument: he snipes and spits at an unknown victim before culminating in an angry my name doesnt change very often/but its never been and cheri daft rows never sound this good in my house sums up the problem: ive got to figure out love dears vocal is not the strongest but he plays it well: sometimes its a bit bowie sometimes a country drawl; sometimes its propped up by double- or triple-tracking sometimes aided by more complex studio devices but his self-consciously schizophrenic approach suits the shifting lyrical narrative and indeed the sonic sprawl flits between a delightfully varied range of styles: from talking heads-influenced flirtations with world music ( ) to strutting summery pop (the deceptively chipper ) and a couple of punchy precise micro-house jaunts before staggering to a downbeat downcast close with and s just when you think you have him figured out (sort of) he closes with the hiccupping structure clattering toms and spiraling synths recalling his audion material thats before the johnny cash-aping hidden track three key things hold this bursting-at-the-seams record together (and it could easily have been one that fell apart): dears distinctive production style; his increased belief in his songwriting ability and subsequently the brevity of the songs: most clock in around the three-minute mark it fits perfectly: this is a pop record and a very fine one at that
returns to following his remix for dadub back in january and this time hes given a spot on the berlin imprints always consistent (and sadly digital-only) monad series enigmatic producer has over the past few years been working with an elemental approach to techno thats as mental as it is physical and here aligned nicely with monad s experimental theme he goes even deeper than usual resulting in perhaps his most compelling work yet ep is all about patient builds and dissolves chockfull of heady goodness opener is drenched with wide-open drones and echoed clangs and goes un-anchored by a kick drum for more than three minutes is the only track here that starts right away with a kick but it still shows great restraint only gradually letting its swirling synths and rushing cymbals reach their maximum brain-chopping intensity is essentially beat-less as it falls into a yawning abyss but its kaleidoscopic sirens bleeping in and out of sync with each other create a tangle of movement on the way down finally theres a 100 bpm cut that you might remember from the early goings of s ra podcast last year using discordant high-pitched melodies that seem to come from some shamanistic woodwind instrument it completes a half hour of fantastically out-there techno soundscapes best heard from front to back
nders trentem llers music has always been touched by dub and now in this collaboration with s dj lab he goes properly dub crazy (girl remix) opens with a classic maurizio groove that moves through the wash and swirl you expect from an release but there is also a strange energy here lasers diced vocals and special effects glide haphazardly across the frame evoking the spontaneity and occasional aimlessness of a live jam session you can hear trentem ller moving the furniture in s carefully arranged living room round the five-minute mark a spiky synthesizer unexpectedly kidnaps the track carrying it down an evil electro path before circling back to atmospheric dub techno stern and big-shouldered affair ( oy remix) is the mirror image of the girl remix opening with a skeletal framework that hits its stride after the first minute the track hews to a classic mad professor template as a sparse beat moves through a daisy chain of reverb and delay pedals my only complaint with both tracks is the amount of effects theres so much frosty reverb its hard to find your footing here lasers shoot flangers flare and every now and then something launches and takes off this compulsive knob-twiddling buries the guts of each song under a glossy sheen that makes it feel slightly remote side from this cosmetic quibble however these are two high-powered dub tracks each one worthy of the estimable names printed on the record sleeve
from mickey moonlight to motor city drum ensemble mike huckaby to a guy called gerald there has always been a vocal minority within electronic music who are ready to invoke the power of sun ras astral jazz 20 years on from the big mans death (or as his hardcore devotees insist his return to saturn) the tributes continue last year zombie zombie took ras afrofuturism as a jumping-off point for a playful homage in fizzing analogue electronics now london brothers tom ben page aka named after a sun ra track of course are weighing in with their own exploration of the arkestras lineage the page boys record live their setup revolving around wild jazz drumming fat analogue keys on the face of it its pretty serious if not scholarly stuff kieran hebden facilitated their entry into clubl but on propulsive tracks like and sounds more like fridge than four tet in their swarming drama delicious crescendos loose drumming the dynamics are all post-rock la mogwai godspeed you emperor there is however a lighter more obviously club-based aspect to the group they like to retread 90s rave motifs that would seem outright cheesy in any other context recalling the frivolity of br t brauer fricks early work nags at the simplest of riffs tugging twisting at it rolling it over stretching it out as it takes on a new hypnotic intensity merges the rhythms of fela kuti junglist basslines with a fond cheeky irreverence while distills punk energy afro-jazz percussion uk hardcores dread-electronics into the kind of fusion that anyone who has ever bought anything on ze or dfa will appreciate and a much smoother self-consciously modish dance track sounds a little meek in this company but then is on record really the best way to hear probably not this is a perfectly fine debut but probably nothing compared to seeing them live rn9 have already supported radiohead its clear that if dropped into the middle of a 4/4 dance music lineup at this summers festivals their hip-shaking shamanic noise could turn a willing crowd into a baying demented moshpit what sun ra thinks of all this we can only wonder
first appearing back in september 2011 as the closer jamie joness fabric mix may be the defining s track it sits somewhere between tears for s early output and violator -era depeche mode with melancholic vocals leading an infectiously haunted groove the arrival the canadian duos album earlier this year saw the version from fabric 59 re-mastered giving the vocals more clarity and the instrumental components more drive which resulted in an altogether glossier aesthetic its hard not to feel the rougher original version is actually superior but either way the track is possibly the strongest the duo has recorded for the first his three remixes leo converts the original into a chunky slab balearic the lyrics seem slightly out- -sync with their surroundings yet on the whole the balmy disco angle works surprisingly well a comparatively flat instrumental version and a rudderless folky interpretation follow a remix from someone else may have strengthened the package
s t was cast in the phaeleh mould all silky r b vocal samples and 2 step rhythms set in wispy sonic fields for his remix the first side of a split 12 inch for the label djrum is nothing if not ambitious he balances pitched up vocals with fattened low end jazz and trip hop influence his widened sound palette and the result is intriguing with a noodly if nevertheless enjoyable sax passage plaintive strings and new vocals t 11 minutes the track could do with some trimming but its certainly one of the better executed post dubstep remixes of late the b side is less successful sc reworks s appropriately titled into a techno track where the originals great slabs of bass and eerie spaces recalled shackleton sc favours more overtly creepy greyscale textures and propulsive rhythm its a record of two halves; djrums remix makes the track a good deal more enigmatic but on his remix sc strips the mystery away
s latest single is by theres not much to say about the producer as the press release if its to be believed simply says that the music was brought to the labels attention via the djhistory message board s three original tracks were made in the basement of an old tram station in a town that was probably london [in] 1990 and subsequently stored on vintage dat a rework of by tuff (aka phillip lauer and label boss gerd janson) occupies the its a raw swung and bouncy drum track and a suburb dj tool the pairs belting stop-start percussion makes it the most brazen cut on the ep and a far cry from s originals and youre are summery and low-key warm-up fodder both making use of pleasant and inoffensive melodies closer is a mess is the most contemporary-sounding effort its thick analogue bass giving it solid dance floor appeal
clearly knew what he was doing when he called his label since 2013 hes found an overlooked crevice in the uk bass edifice and perched there happily making humble tracks that sound surprisingly fresh recent cassette album garden reach built on the style explored on a handful of singles this two-tracker is a nice partner piece to it: a pair of bitesize morsels that explore the two contrasting flavours in s sound the just mix of is in sadsack synth mode: think yamaneko if his main reference points were joker and early night slugs s ear for synth design is pretty keen these days and he gives simple sounds an enticing sheen: xylophone chords balance warmth and plastic twang and long background tones wobble and melt in attractive patterns the original version of the track shuffles onto the dance floor the model for its crisp syncopated drums is swamp81 but gives it a cute spin his claps shakers and tinkling bells sound tiny and perfectly formed as if theyre miniatures of the original sounds rendered with a craftsmans care
artists and labels who produce a relative paucity of material often leave you constantly craving more like a tantalizing entr e at an expensive restaurant mike simonetti and johnny jewel of have this down to a fine art: the imprint has released a steady trickle of material since 2008s after dark compilation but only enough to stay on the radar fans of italians never leave feeling overindulged nonetheless this year has seen some superb releases; from desires debut album to bottins storming no static twisted wires night at the raw deal ep and premier rangs italo gem les corps humides and so it continues with ramona gonzalezs project the californian philosophy student conceptual artist and songwriter is a rare elegant talent combining ethereal vocals with a penchant for vintage recording techniques however its johnny jewels own production methods or at the very least his creative influence that are apparent from the first piano stab on the title track of her new ep an echo of his previous work with chromatics glass candy and gonzalez herself a superb piece of alternative spooky disco its noticeably different from the material on gonzalezs debut album good evening which she recorded herself on a portable eight-track cassette deck the accompanying vocal version brings her unique singing voice to the fore making it more than mere filler or a dj tool eminently listenable in its own right on the flip of continues in much the same vein trading piano and synths but this time its done at a much slower pace although theres still a nod to vintage disco in the production both the original and the spanish version of the track teeter on the verge of ambient perhaps reflecting gonzalezs love of conceptual sound and video installation art her straining vocals take a back seat on this occasion; the lyrics are so drowned out theyre barely intelligible
the chilean rock trio f llakzoid must have been thrilled the night they met j spaceman from spacemen 3 f llakzoids first two albums are clearly indebted to the english guitarist and space rock original enlisting him in a session rerecording live to tape two tracks from their 2015 album iii sounds like a dream come true and were originally extended krautrock jams which is what you also get with these versions ut whether its due to the adrenalin that comes from playing alongside a musician you admire j spacemans cosmic touch or other stars aligning these versions feel more primal and alluring than the originals even though its the same percussion locking the motorik groove london sessions has a taut funk instead of stiff beats featuring guitars drenched in reverb touched with fuzz and given plenty of room to breathe and crescendo these rock trances are variations of a familiar formula the revelation comes in opening your third eye
moscow-based oleg buyanov aka has previously released tracks on labels such as astro nautico and faces but he has also built a sizeable online following through a regular stream of ear-popping diy digital freebies is arguably his most in-depth body of work yet serves as a hauntingly textured intro that eventually kicks into a stuttered pathway of off-kilter beats before trailing woozily on to buyanov chops up a sample from wu-tangs classic c r e a m but gleaming synths and lush percussion give the footwork-tinged track an alluring contemporary glow and twist and turn ferociously rollicking in the darkness between sending the listener into warm eye-of-the-storm lulls perhaps the most interesting track of the ep comes when teams up with lapti to deliver as lush a ghetto-tech tune as youll hear this year the soulful samples echo into an infinite chamber of light and frantic footwork beats a smooth ending to an intensely addictive journey
its now been five years since canadian berlin-transplant colin de la plante dropped his debut album as on wagon repair released in those heady early days of spring s high s the sky saw de la plante refining his kaleidoscopic approach to loopy disco and house for a producer whod long made his name on club 12-inches for labels like kompakt and musique risqu e it was a surprisingly coherent statement for his second album as de la plante appears on his own label which he launched last year with kompakts jon berry recorded in berlin at wagon repairs studios steams with de la plantes psychedelic melding of house and disco much like s high s the sky its sewn together with gaps and bridges that show the breadth de la plantes colorful approach to dance music seems almost waterlogged beneath his humid disco breaks mines similar dead-of-summer climes its hand claps and various synth lines merging into a hypnotic aquiline groove elsewhere theres the dial-esque house of ffair with its wispy night-trail vibes or the crowd-sampling headspinner tech house of s usual de la plante massages his work into an album that works either flat on your back or out in a club but the more you settle in with the more you notice the lack of those muscular stretches and ear-worm moments that gave s high s the sky such longevity in fact may be most intriguing when de la plante delivers some of his most narcotic moments to date the hip-hop breaks cartoon samples and quiet synths of sound like the cyborg pillow music phex twin was onto circa selected mbient works 85-92 the closer creates a strangely velveteen headspace too with its slo-mo stumble just barely propelling those gorgeous space-odyssey synths into a sleepy drift overall these downtempo retreats seem more weighty and resolute than most of s party tracks
expect libidinous tech funk from whose desert island album is princes purple rain ut while past eps like smut and sexy dancer could be buzzing neon signs in an alley the new spectral 12-inch opts for a more discreet locale ehind the black door in curtiss words lies a land of pleasure pain and wonderment a vivid scenario for his first detroit on detroit experience formerly known as lee meyers curtiss has a curious sound palette but ep is appealing because he succumbs to his love of 80s pop and disco is a confident groove that wastes no time exposing its parts: a dark kick immediately threads with quick gasps shrieks and a michael hutchence in the hall of mirrors vocal you make me you make me feel it unfolds predictably with claps subtle conga and shaker one bass note throbs insistently to reinforce the words; a sawtooth bass pushes a devilish diminished chord with the lightness of water vapor from the ceiling high phasing synth provides harmonic relief dyed soundorum leads across a moving floor and the of the remix emerges with a crunk swagger he pitches up and down in favor of the funhouse approach dropping snare accents and disco bombs you make me feel becomes i want you for this reason the bassline gets more action and the diminished interval or tri-tone moves to the percussion is a breathy disco dub the leftover pleasure and wonderment of after hours delayed and rhythmic strings wander and eventually coax patrons toward the exit just interesting enough to entertain and not to overwhelm has an ideal hypnotic quality that can transform the shy onlookers into cocksure participants
lennard poschmann aka is one of the more promising talents to rise from the recent surplus of deep melodic house producers his eye-catching debut on in july last year sparked interest from the sounds principal purveyors innervisions who included wells in their four-part project to mark their 50th release a year on from that first ep wells returns to larj with another textured and tuneful four-tracker compared to his previous work theres something more polished about this release er does as its name suggests sending dainty brushstrokes across a mellow bed of gently oscillating synths the textures though typically well balanced are a little clean cut is even more subdued and as a result more captivating cosy chords and flickers glide over a leisurely bassline which protrudes just enough to keep things rolling s a sunrise number and the best track of the four on the other hand sees wells lay down his most club-ready cut to date and it doesnt pay off the union of a plodding bassline with a piping melody feels elementary and overdone displaying none of the subtlety hes so capable of some of that deftness of touch returns on as snug keys and coiled 303s merge neatly to convey a bright summery atmosphere fans of wells larj debut may enjoy this ep but they probably wont prefer it
shadowy uk producer first surfaced late last year with a pair of ten-inch eps on the avian offshoot mira which he now follows up with a twelve-inch three-tracker for called hes got a soft spot for gritty experimentally-tinged techno and once explained in an interview that he only spends an hour crafting each track that constraint yields a sense of raw immediacy in his music but also makes sure to sneak in bits of nuance as necessary s snarling lead is scrubbed scratched and stretched which helps keep the track from becoming an aimless stomp with its oddly gleeful yelps will probably be too abrasive for some ears but i think its the standout thanks to some smart sequencing and wonderfully effective drum fills which sweeps a chugging minor-key riff up into the atmosphere while exposing a boiling bog down below tops off another record geared towards weirder warehouse scenarios
ben klocks fabric mix is the gift that keeps on giving after his edit of josh winks are you there hit wax in april now we get the release of s the track seems like it was tailored for a klock set: its slight bounce and pumping chords have the same fluid motion that he taps into with his dj sets stir in marching tom rolls and some heady filtering and its the most memorable thing rachmad has released in some time with its two-note organ riff and sinewy synths is more expressive than its counterparts its the only thing here with the emotive quality we associate with the other two are spartan bangers has one of those shuddering sheet metal riffs and not a whole lot else outside of some delay effects is a marathon sprint based on a percolating percussive lead and some heavily sustained organ notes that ratchet up the tension these simpler moments might leave you lusting after the dynamism of but its hard to imagine any four tracks working better for a release than these

as the glittering centers of globalized capitalism slowly teeter and rot from within partners antye greie (agf) and sasu ripatti (vladislav delay/luomo) arrive with an album that syncs up well with these dark days is a soundtrack for an anxious cold cityscape and the apprehensive frigid people within even kicking off with a peel of thunder with the refrain look dont touch / listen dont talk and lines like perfect war perfect phone absence of lust chronicles a certain sickness and based on the bulk of the lyrics here there doesnt seem to be a cure forthcoming we eat the same shit / we shit the same color certainly isnt about togetherness disconnection is a potent theme in this anti-utopian dance music whether its physical distance social anxiety or existential pain i am no longer following the concept of empathy runs throughout the dissonant synths of lyrics like who owns my connection to you from suggest emotional turmoil and incongruity but with the mechanized industrial beats percolating throughout the album it wouldnt be a stretch to look at it as a statement about privacy in the internet age the music is industrial but not in the genre sense its literally mechanical filled with small clicks breaking glass the hiss of gaseous exhaust and the static and shrill beeps of a carrier signal its too expertly sculpted and layered to be called merely cold though like agfs work with ellen allien on sool and her own dance floor drachen theres a sense of echoing space on sound dissipates and decays into a vacuum that moves at a noticeably quicker march forward than the duos previous and more mellow album explode only heightens the anxiety its when the group is at its most urgent like opener that they draw the most out of this dark template slower songs like tend to drag and highlight a limited vocal range or maybe the message just makes more sense with a bit more passion and anger behind it
mply bearded erliner oskar offermann has asserted that his latest 12-inch is a bit of a departure from the house sound hes known for ut while the two tracks found on find the producer standing as firmly in techno as he ever has its hardly an about-face: driving and a touch austere offermanns take on house has long suggested that were you to take a coin to it you might be able to scratch down to the techno lurking just below the surface s such offermann doesnt sound like hes dabbling with the more techno-minded kareem on whites 14th release so much as amplifying an already three-dimensional aspect of his musical personality the title cut is devoid of the political content its name suggests save the basically expendable vocal sample of unknown provenance that wanders in and thankfully makes an early exit with the sample gone we can wander freely in the duos charred landscape not exactly a beautiful place but certainly a handcrafted one messiahs recalls the warm rolling techno of dj rolando where a simple yet fiery synth line twitches over slippery percussion loops while both tracks go hard neither would sound entirely out of place in the sort of sets where white releases tend to live adding a little extra snarl to an otherwise smiling sound

s noted in the past matthew puffett has a penchant for happy sounds the frantic arpeggios and joyful synth splashes his project favours arent for everyone of his latest release the ritish producer says i guess its more of a darker approach to my sound ut still maintaining a certain amount of soul within the music; a little bit of light towards the end of the tunnel just as the title says: puffett must be a happy man indeed because both sides of the record still show a relentless optimism for example builds busily until puffett strips it all back for a gentle cymbal and bouncy synths with the mid-section reprising the crowd of brash sounds its only in the last minute that anything remotely melancholy in this case a pad takes control nevertheless its impact is lessened by giant shuddering vibrations like a wire cable getting plucked emotionally the title track works in reverse with a fat breezy arpeggio lightening the gloom halfway through its not especially dark before then but loads of reverb and faint howling noises do feel somewhat ghostly the tracks considerable momentum is generated via a torrent of hypnotic drum hits placed between the main kicks even if its not what most of us would call dark is another notch in puffetts already considerable belt
theres a friction in dean blunts records in which conflicting ideas about music jostle for dominance a classic example is the opening of 2013s the redeemer 30 seconds of lush (real) strings suggest one thing; the awkward synthesised ones that follow deliver something else entirely the real strings are actually a sample from the 1997 r b ballad all my life by k-ci jojo by colliding different sound worlds (big-budget studio versus bedroom noodling) and techniques (stealthy sampling versus singer-songwriter authenticity ) blunt encourages a very postmodern scepticism in his listeners even the nicest bits of 2014s black metal for instance leave you wondering whether blunt is really making beautiful shoegaze or just sampling it to make some meta point about the heritage of his label rough trade from blunts new project brings a fresh set of variables into play if the releases discogs page is to be believed it was recorded with a crack team of los angeles instrumentalists and singers (including the respected producer-songwriter jeff gitelman) perhaps in stones throws highland park studio (their in-house producer jake viator is credited as engineer) blunt seems to be more of a facilitator than a composer in the traditional sense and as usual he might have some sly ulterior motive the lauryn hill portrait on the cover a song title referencing fox drama empire ( lyon ) and the music a languid accretion of downtempo beats sweet rhodes and guitar suggest that hes commenting on a particular black american music culture as much as he is earnestly participating in it in the records best moments this dual motive is audible and unsettling on clunky synth strings in the style of the redeemer converse awkwardly with the slick backing band is the records strangest track its synth and guitar licks roaming distant tonal zones over swelling strings these tracks find a strange melancholy in their innocuous materials mostly though a pro studio and pro musicians turn out to be fallow ground for blunts subversive tactics the likes of and lack the mysterious third dimension that would make them more than scrappy neo-soul pastiche perhaps its unfair to expect too much from a free online release with minimal context or promotion but some of blunts best music is hidden in a diffuse galaxy of unofficial releases s shortcomings can be encapsulated in one sound: the unsightly weals of distortion on the vocals in jennas and closer poor sound quality isnt by definition a flaw particularly not in dean blunts music but in this case its not a sign of things rubbing against one another productively; it just sounds like a mistake
previous record once gain on royal oak may have been fairly straightforward but with his first this year the house lover shows a reluctance to be pinned down eponymous track is about as erratic as they come throwing bright slivers of melody headlong into the mix and scattering them the second they arrive hang on long enough however and the pieces start to assemble themselves into more coherent loops its like watching a window smashing in reverse sounds like last years haiti from the aforementioned once gain only all juiced up on opiates it employs a similar piano loop but this time the keys drift along in a contented narcotic daze rather than bounding forward dainty pads float alongside in a similar fug adding to the spaced-out mood real curveball however is its a meaty techno stomper; the kind of thing marcellus pittman or omar-s might put together nd it marches quite literally mass of jackbooted goosestepping soldiers it evokes sound like theyre at the window onto this indefatigable foundation theres really only one serious addition: a gyrating buzzy synth which spreads the focus around somewhat s a result what could have been a repetitive tedious cut is instead hypnotic and almost infinitely replayable
fter a pair of singles on border community new chilean on the block jumps to the traum stable for a three-tracker that fuses some distinctly rocking sounds with traditional minimal beats tobar has shown a propensity to utilize interesting sources on his previous outings and theres no shortage of them this time out either -side wraps its stop-start beat work in a thick sheath of analog noise that wouldnt sound out of place on a stereolab or spacemen 3 recording the juxtaposition works well as tobar moves the knobs adventurously enough to keep what basically amounts to a drone interesting; part of it is his percussion which is steady and driving without being too flashy and part of it is the variety of filters and twists he applies to the drone itself tobar also adds a few mini-breakdowns that should pay off well on the floor jocks looking to add a little roughage to their sets should eat this up the title track on the other hand swaps the electronic buzz for some psyched-out guitar wankery and though the beats are a tad more intriguing the whole thing falls a bit flat whereas the wall of noise on provided a steady shot of adrenaline here its a bit leaden and stiff closer a is a more straightforward minimal thing pinned by a bubble-wrap-popping percussion riff some dark chords and analog burbles likely a useful tool in the box but nothing to write home about tobar is still a pup a 23-year-old music student and so one must presume he still is learning but he certainly is off to a promising start a bit more seasoning his big ideas could pay off in a big way for now however hes got a ways to go before he supplants that other chilean with the same first name
(santiago ferrer) have been recording together since they met in madrid in 2004 following up their release on adam beyer s truesoul earlier this year intelligence reframed arrives on richie hawtin and john acquaviva s renowned label plus 8 from subtle beginnings echolocation launches into a driving beat there s a touch of malevolence here with jangling keys echoing jeff mills metropolis but the pair shape a distinct sound which should distinguish it from the mountain of minimal tracks out there it creepy it has an edge and there s just enough vitality to keep hips moving on the floor as the title suggests cosmic antipathy takes a deeper approach spatial and bubbly it emits alluring squelching tones but in the end fails to ignite a set-builder which will find its home as a short loop during quieter moments vegetotherapy is my pick of the quartet eschewing the quirks of its predecessors it s a solid heads down affair that reminds me of orlando voorn there s also touches of old r s releases here - maybe its nostalgia but i like it the final track is more ill-behaved: delano and xpansul entice us with manic metallic percussion and surgical precision before suddenly turning on us and snapping viciously i predict meta-intellectual will cause a riot on the floor hawtin will take this and bring on a coup detat - watch out a strong outing then innovative stuff which also nods to the past old meets new gives the ep a rounded feel which is not always the case with minimal music the cold metallic feel may at times prove too much for those who like it melodic but this release has its purpose and is not attempting to cover every angle alexi delano also recently turned in a beautiful remix of electronic resistances exposure and teaming with xpansul also appears to have been a good choice

dropped just ahead of their debut full-length is a first peek at rukspin and jack sparrows new partnership those anticipating an album preview however can think again not that this ep is in any way disappointing both efforts here are solid tectonic-quality dubstep of the calibre one has come to duly expect from pinchs stable is a guaranteed floor killer and was undoubtedly wielded at some stage over the course of this years outlook festival and in club outings since on the other hand is an ample showcase of the genres broodier side as woodblocks and bells tumult with techier stabs through an ominous dub vista microscopic trumpet peals in do albeit faintly hint of the melodic and instrumentatal approach planned for the outfit ruckspin after all has showcased his dub jazz and reggae influences on his oft-lyrical collection of ranking records notably on collaborations with edward gooden k quark but while it would seem that most of s penned musicality has been reserved for the album is a cracking and perhaps not quite final salute to the floor before the pair lead us into more of a sitting-down kind of appreciation
in a year which saw a plethora of tribal tinged exotic house records south african culoe de s debut stood out as what you might call the real deal in contrast to tracks that merely deployed ethnic beats and unusual percussion for novel effect and its successor worked out from within african music traditions to meet electronic club music head on it wasnt afro house so much as african music which happened to be heavily influenced by house squeezed out at the end of a whirlwind year delivers on its title by significantly advancing the african electronic template that saw culoe plucked out of the red bull music academy in the first place delivering on previous promise while hinting at future progression whereas tunes on the earlier two eps year relied largely on shifting layers of tribal drums adds an impressive array of vocalists into this mix cd of original productions including the renowned mail singer across the lps front half the rhythms barely change together with sustained ethereal chords the drums provide a driving pulse for a gorgeously orchestrated tide of overlapping vocal lines a mixture of chants and calls whose joyous ecstatic energy fall somewhere between a church choir performance and a party under the stars two remixes appear in the middle but youll have to follow the tracklisting closely to figure out which ones they are as theyve been effortlessly woven into culoes tribal tapestry culoes dub version of a tune by soundiatas is carried by a trebly guitar scratch riff reminiscent of 60s highlife and an elongated synth line while sound effects skitter in the background se elements blend without warning into a remake of by stretched out by culoe into a breathless expansive plateau choir melody sung in the succeeding neighbour so neatly responds to the chanted chorus of that it gives the feeling of a live improvised medley this is culoe is at his strongest infusing club music with the unpredictable vibrance of folk performance as a whole takes the concept of a seamlessly mixed lp to new heights its like a suite an epic scaled sound world that entrances with graceful gentle transitions between new tracks remixes and previous ep material re arent marked differences between the songs just subtle gradations over a long period of time which gives the record a quite organic elemental feel as if youre watching the movements of shadows on the plain made as the sun marches across an open sky this also means that if you do a needle drop somewhere in the middle any particular tune will convey the sound of the whole record fairly easily experience of this sound however is best done as culoe intended from start to finish in an immersive exploration of variations on a theme

over the past year has become one of the most talked about producers in electronic music nd why not hes been feted by ndrew weatherall secured a deal with erol lkans and has a forthcoming mix for fabric this wave of hype has been backed up with results: verys singles for phantasy have been uniformly excellent and always surprising his sound is coherent an english take on chloe/ivan smagghe perhaps but its also proved mighty versatile as well is no exception its title track has the typical machines undergirding his tidy breakbeat but with a female voice moaning in time and a creepy water water jump vocal going around as well theres a foreboding sense that things couldve gotten far darker if he had let it reveals what it says on the tin and is a tough acidic banger which breaks down into nothingness before getting rebuilt from the ground-up closer is something else altogether ten minutes long it hints that very has been listening to the chems the private psychedelic reel its not a bad reference point to have all things considered its why very sounds so fresh: underground dance music with this sort of ambition hasnt been heard in quite a while
s half of conga radio toronto producer robert steenkamer makes garage house via alearica the groups warm analog basslines co-mingling with jex opoliss silky smooth guitars and vocals the duo has been making a name for itself thanks to a couple of excellent releases on jexs good timin label and its easy to see why cuts like slumber dance are a classy update on timeless influences like the urrell rothers now on his third solo release as steenkamer reveals hes the spot-on rhythm section to jexs frontman for tom s label is no-frills analog house music of the highest order like peak nu groove creates that deep feeling with just a handful of elements s basics include a diving bassline some hazy pads warm synth strings and a hand-played lead theres a liveness to the production that makes it obvious that steenkamer like close peer suzanne kraft (or jex for that matter) can play superbly ut that instrumental dexterity comes with a rare restraint: feels bashed out and left alone at just the right moment on his remix whos done edit work for labels like clone loft supreme and whatchawannado focuses on the sparse drums and he works some impressive magic the original version in no way feels incomplete yet the edits percussive updates fit like a glove adds a pumping kick some swinging hand percussion hi-hats and shakers and calls it a day its a subtly crafted floor-filler disguised as a warm-up track leaving s dreamy essence intact
david moufang s work as move d is geometric drafted with neat points long curves and straight lines benjamin brunn s sound signature meanwhile is closer to fluid mechanics or the physics of how fluid moves together these two approaches harmonise wonderfully with moufang s structures providing solid shapes for brunn s melodic whirlpools and rhythmic glidings to unwind through that is to say d builds the beehive brunn makes the honey result of their labour is a work of buzzing sweetness one that melds solid beats and liquid atmospheres into a musical substance that s soothing yielding and almost therapeutically easy to listen to t the same time there s great complexity here if you care to turn the volume dial clockwise: this is a record which opens up into a microscopic labyrinth of levels and layers full of thrumming enthralling vibrations album opens with the you re which sounds like the sun emerging from behind spring clouds pouring twinkling light onto rain-washed concrete straight away all the elements of the album are evident: layer upon layer of cycling sounds some soft all polished clean and arranged in such a way that their value is equally rhythmic timbral and melodic such a blend could end up being sound soup but there s just enough separation of the elements for motivations to remain apparent and for the flavours to remain distinct not only that but however abstracted this is still groove music still house albeit a house made for and by another species so then (of course) there s which is close to isol e s music the isol e of lost commonality comes from the burbling gulp of the synth line the epic length of the reverb-widened corridor it opens and the way the whole arrangement chases itself down it n there s also the visual connection drawn (literally) by stefan marx whose art has adorned other smallville records as well as select playhouse and mule releases back to the source of the buzz and to its ebb and flow in particular another hallmark here is the way moufang and brunn take their foot off the boom-click pedal and allow the soundfields they make to fill with loose-moving air sheer joy throughout is the massive undercurrent of floating tones the last largest and perhaps best track on the album is the very definition of house in zero gravity it s a pleasure that s only equalled by the way the whole thing eventually evaporates underneath slowly bringing you back (safely comfortably) to terra firma s a listening experience songs from the beehive is captivating s you can probably tell by now i think the whole thing is magnificent credulous readers should be mindful that i m partial to this style though others might not find it so engaging ll the same there s something really special here which is why songs from the beehive deserves an unconditional recommendation and is my shoo-in for album of the year (so far) this is more than just entertainment better than just well made good entertainment does what it should and if it speaks it speaks to you of other things it reminds you of something else you enjoy but great albums speak about themselves they draw you in and suspend you in their own inimitable soundworld from first note to last songs from the beehive is just such an album and it sings sweetly
makes music far more serious than his name would suggest after first appearing as stress assassin and swayze dub at the beginning of the 00s the swedish producer real name henrik jonsson debuted his current nom de guerre with a string of experimental albums for city centre offices a now shuttered manchester label co-founded by shlom sviri of boomkat and modern love since 2009 or so jonssons been crafting lean and spacey club cuts on his own and with others namely sued label boss svn or joel alter as jonsson/alter his latest double-pack on aniara is the most thorough exploration yet of his elegant and understated techno collects five tracks recorded between 2009 and 2014 we get a rare glimpse of jonsson in party mode on a soaring bit of piano house with a snappy electro beat but this is the exception rather than the norm: the other four productions are long subtle and evocative each one painting its own shadowy landscape races along at 129 bpm but with a hushed soothing quality as if coasting through a fog at night f r has a misty atmosphere as well lit ever so slightly by the flickering glow of an organ a collaboration with svn is armed with thick dub techno chords and kick drums like carved marble but still maintains the records dreamy mood only a somber bit of a detroit-style deep house starts to feel a bit drawn out over the course of its nine minutes though it too conjures a vivid space that pulls you in
named themselves after the deceased hollywood legend james and base their sound around electro fusing together elements of song writing and live instrumentation to create their catchy grooves s has been doing the rounds recently and is sure to become one of the big anthems of originally released on germanys great stuff records had noticed its potential and snapped it up but not without grabbing a few new artists to remix it along the way namely the stanton warriors jca and raul rincon (the latter two remixes not being reviewed here) side a original kicking off with a stomping 4 to the floor beat (with occasional elements of breakbeat thrown in) and a very plump and obese bouncing bassline it doesnt take long for the collage of tech stabs synth drops and cut up vocal samples makes its presence felt (not to mention that vocal sample that feels like its been lifted off an old coldcut tune back in their beats pieces and say kids what time is it days to make it even more catchy drop a massive synth line that should get stuck into peoples heads much like the recent electro hit alter egos rocker did to us all side b stanton warriors remix in true stanton style the warriors bring in the trademark stanton break that weve become so accustomed to apart from that everything else about the tune is pretty much left intact during the middle the warriors introduce a massive bassline breakdown with new female vocals added to the recipe - bringing the vibe of the tune to a slightly darker environment those who loved the stanton/punks bootlegs will know what to expect from this and this one should get lots of plays

surely only a serial groper would fail to see the problem with s a song that places the line cos if a lady says no she means yes over a thudding tech house beat prior to that nugget id thought summers just beginning i dont want it to end was s lyrical nadir but its nice to be surprised nothing about the diynamic bosss first output on his own label in two years is subtle s set out to fashion an ibiza anthem and in the process hes exorcised all the shades that made tracks like love recycled daddys jam or his ubiquitous remix of around so intriguing where those tracks slinked from the speakers and entwined you in melody canters past its details a blur the three versions cover much the same ground all stomping kick drums and big-room bass stabs the original is the least inventive relying on the vocal to do most of the work while snares clack away over sub pulses the summer egan mix is more inspired with pitch-bent arps and an arms-aloft chord progression emerging in the breakdown ut its the dub that should have most traction the more exciting instrumental elements stitched together for an eight-minute assault of heads-down tech house its the not the anthem will have been hoping for but no doubt itll rattle a terrace or two
has long been responsible for nurturing the north merican bass music scene as a booking agency both in terms of homegrown djs as well as bringing some of the biggest uk and european djs to the frontier their dominance has perhaps naturally grown into a record label the purpose of which seems to be showcasing north merican talent the third release is a collaborative effort from tlantas and as well as one of vancouvers most prolific purveyors of bass music the original has big tune written all over it: a soothing chord progression gives way to sparse ticking percussion (i assume the title comes from the toothpick drums and other assorted clicks and rattles) underpinned by swooning synth chords a la ok ok or girl unit the tracks most distinctive moment comes in its breakdown or rather self destruction signaled by a downward arcing synth that sends it veering off road blasting through thickets of bouncy vocal tics the is more of a fastidious retouch than a complete rehaul turning those vocal tics into pockmarks on the tracks surface and removing the skewed dynamics of the abrupt breakdown it turns the weirdness of the original into a smouldering building dance floor tune and the microscopic scale of the elements seems to reference minimal techno in a manner similar to orphan101s recent release on pplepips on the flip is a less interesting collaboration between and : arnacles emits frigidly pulsating dub techno chords over top a rigid dubstep structure adorned with drawn out and synthetic reggae horns its a fine track but never quite reaches the lofty territory that so breezily scales
has always released moody music the bucharest labels records are aimed at djs but it certainly doesnt specialise in party-rocking cuts all that it puts out is heavily atmospheric and dark even for romanian standards the kind of sounds that often work best as part of a long session noidoi member dubtil supplies s latest 12-inch the ebandogue ep its been getting rinsed by romanias top-tier for some time and its not hard to see why the sounds are meaty intricate and groovy with enough subtle changes to make each track a journey in itself it can be a bit risky to drop such sinister sounds at the tail-end of a party but ebandogue seems well suited to late-hour situations where priku and arapu embraced sunshine with their recent i/0 ep dubtil has turned his back on it is the eps most disorienting moment with frantic chopped vocals buried beneath a soundscape that rises and falls with an oscillating horn sound is a little more subdued but it fosters an enthralling sense of tension making it a powerful track in the right djs hands the ep finishes with the excellent the safest and only straightforward cut on offer

between running her own label djing around the world and broadcasting a weekly radio show has somehow found time to release two solid tracks with a little help from co-producer paul brtschitsch quick warning i wouldn t recommend consuming any mind-altering psychedelics before listening to title track it s a broody tripped out mind-bender which wouldn t feel out of place as the score to psycho with no builds or breakdowns rhythms and effects dart in out creating a layer of intensity that leaves you on edge it s dark and seedy and could be used as a nice bridge track to set the tone for harder more minimal sounds to come b-side is a lighter shuffling house affair with the rhythmic toms giving proceedings a pleasant deepness more sinister side appears though with the introduction of the eerie siren effect which punctuates the second half of the track it s the type of sound one might here on re-runs of the 1960 s batman tv series when the bad guys are introduced onto the scene the track is a contradiction of sorts with both relaxing and heavy elements at play yet somehow they work together the accompanying press release says that the hissing ride cymbals [on ] cut through the murk like a flash of shark fins and that has an irresistible melody that swirls like dandelion tufts on the last days of summer but i wouldn t go that far both tracks should nonetheless get some nods of approval on the dancefloor
rizzla aka brian friedberg is a founding member of kunq a queer collective that to put it simply looks to regional scenes and sounds to instil dance music with political history and energy friedbergs dj sets and unofficial edits inspired by the caribbean music he discovered while studying in trinidad brim with elastic sometimes crazed motion as well as a syncopation borrowed from styles like dembow and soca hes been a staple at events for years and is one of their unsung heroes is the artists long-awaited debut for the american label one that more than lives up to the promise of his dj sets and early bootlegs is a fine opener highlighting how friedberg can find tension in the smoothest sounds the instrumental is fluid and sexy but guns and sirens are hidden in its sinuous movements with a stellar vocal from and some tasteful guitar from daniel aged of inc its turn-of-the-millennium pop with a bite the rest of is considerably harsher it rattles with the energy of ballroom and swings and swoops with the jagged arc of dembow is a barrage of distorted drums flanked by pitched-down dancehall vocals and beastly moans while works vintage rave synths into a windstorm of percussion recalling hardcores darkest throes moving over to trance and hardstyle has a nightcore reverie running beneath its percussive spray and ballroom-style stabs the track finds beauty in its rhythmic assault is the simplest tune here and it gets the point across most efficiently centering on an eerie glockenspiel melody that sounds like trap caught in a wind a tunnel when friedberg picks up the pace the glockenspiel is sent into double-time frenzy the carnivalesque tempo changes give the track an unstable feel that functions like an antidote to quantized house music on social media friedberg is an outspoken advocate for queer and minority rights which gives his music a political edge ( is named for a book about institutional racism in the us ) if cleaned up well-produced electronic music is the domain of white privilege as elysia crampton put it in a recent interview then rizzla is reassembling it in sharper and more violent forms
leeds techno artist samir alikhanizadeh has been on quite a journey already so the next logical step was to set up a label pt/5 a joint venture with al gill debuts with an ep from leicester duo it dovetails with the fiery uncompromising industrial techno that alikhanizadeh has been shredding bassbins with these past two years back in 2012 s jack brewin and calum price were in a metal band but their new sound is even more crushing is a neck-grabbing techno onslaught with elephantine kicks and abrasive swirls of acid takes a different tack although an underlying malevolence remains it begins with a surge of white noise and a security-alarm yelp that increases in intensity before exploding into a half-stepping monster clanking and booming like a steelworks truss recasts as nightmarish electro the bass juddering and jolting with an unforgiving intensity shifted takes for a late night trip into deep atmospheric techno territory armed with throbbing bass and flecks of skittering ambient noise
this remix 12-inch of two tracks by genre-melting glasgow collective golden teacher is yet another product of the citys fertile green door studio the remixer is uk dub production legend dennis bovell whose long career has included work for everyone from the slits to the pop group and linton kwesi johnson as well as his own hugely influential solo records optimos jd twitch learned that bovell was going to be in glasgow for a show last year and in the kind of why-the-hell-not moment of cross-pollination that the green door seems great at facilitating asked him if hed like to to do something with golden teachers music that it all came to pass is according to jd twitch a dream come true bovells touch with the tracks is in tune with the groups sound on his remix of he spreads wandering lines from a korg ms-10 and copious space echo over the bones of the original which was the lead track from 2013s do not go gentle into that good night ep on the flip he tackles the unreleased pitching everything down to an intoxicated 100 bpm chug rife with echoing keys and organ flashes and turning singer cassies vocal into a dread-soaked transmission both remixes exude the quality of a class act working on another class act
archie hamilton is an artist on the rise since finishing 2016 with a first-time slot in ras top djs poll hes debuted at fabrics new friday party in london toured south america and released another ep through fuse the label and party hes been affiliated with since 2014 though some might consider him a cast-iron member of the east london crew hes actually more of a peripheral figure splitting the rest of his time between making music and running which he set up in 2009 hamiltons two worlds collide on the latest moscow release a three-track ep called produced in collaboration with fuse founder enzo siragusa this is the first collaboration weve heard from the pair contrary to the eps title the results arent innovative when making the kind of stripped-back dubby and rolling club music these two specialise in theres a fine line between dull tracks and those that hit the spot the bassline on the opening cut has a nice roomy bend to it but it only takes you so far the grating whistle that comes later doesnt help matters its a similar deal with the title track as swinging as the drums are theres not enough in the rattling percussion and scratchy synth line to keep you interested sandwiched in between them though is this time a tumbling groove tight as ever is coloured with zesty acid gurgles and warm soothing synths the pacing is fluid and propulsive and it makes you want to dance

in 1989 tobias freund traveled to santiago de chil to play a concert with martin schopf aka dandy jack it turned out to be the first of many similar trips: freund made a lot of friends and fell in love with the city and has made it back nearly every year since this past february he and uwe schmidt passed through for a live gig as tobias and atom tm and freund found time to record some music with javiera gonz les a friend of his wife he came with his 808 202 and a delay unit and gonz lez brought her friend mario jarpa who played organ and recorded everything through a ghetto blaster without rehearsing they swiftly nailed down 12 completely improvised tracks each in one take six of them now make up et the latest ep on freunds label its obvious why freund would want to work with gonz lez: her voice is breathy and disarmingly intimate her lyrics tender and oblique the two artists have great chemistry his ebbing grooves and her quivering phrases wind around each other like wisps of smoke drifting pleasantly and unpredictably five of the tracks ride lilting cluster-esque grooves; the lovely closer is completely beatless of them are brought to life by gonz lezs darkly sensual performance its a strange and lovely record enough to almost make you wish it werent so much of a lark spontaneity is obviously important here but if this is what freund and gonz lez came up with on the first try you have to wonder what might come out of more considered sessions

s interstellar cloud of an album principe el norte was a midwinter treat earlier this year a warm tingly head trip it encapsulated the mans love for cosmic music and progressive rock of a certain ilk (think 70s-era virgin records: faust v rainbow ome musick new age of earth ) t ran nearly 00 minutes and went as deep into space as it did into the furthest reaches of the mind as is wont to do with his own long remixes takes the music even further out stretching more than two hours across two discs for this intergalactic trip a fine roster of fellow heads have been assembled: the ricardo : ube ieroglyphic eing and more the continue their recent renaissance with ient its small hiccups glitches and pop ambient -style skips slowly gaining mass until it reaches a gaseous sublime state they take another pass at on the second disc their eaven ell remix is full of bass swells handclaps and a kick that gathers velocity over 3 minutes suggesting a return to their ambient house glory days ts a rare remix album that can match its predecessor the overlong sun and ungen remixes are the most sluggish of the bunch ts not until a half-hour into the collection when : ube finally kicks things up a notch the frenchman builds his smooth deep house tones around a fat fuzzy sine wave before dropping a drum circles worth of hand percussion on top elsewhere young teases phuture-style acid across his ten-minute trek through the central remixes come from who revisits the sound of his early 00s minimal peak on two versions of across 3 minutes small pocks of steel drum rise amid ever-shifting low-end and skittering percussion on the rab remix on the n del ub further reduces the elements until they float and spin like sand swirling at the bottom of the ocean ut most striking are the remixes from amal moss rather than the tough and abrasive acid tracks hes gained renown for as ieroglyphic eing his first go at is disarming resulting in one of his loveliest and most patient remixes ts as if moss is drawing deep breaths before introducing each element: elegant piano lines in gently accruing layers crashing ocean waves in the distance a bubbling mbira figure in the foreground the second ieroglyphic eing remix features his familiar unrelenting drums after spending hours in outer space that closing track suggests the turbulence of re-entry back to earth
ts surprising that the ukrainian producer akula has gone this long without releasing a full-length and not just because hes so prolific his eps for firecracker and leleka were arranged with a narrative sense that was highly reminiscent of moodymann or hip-hop lps maddeningly short tracks spliced together with bits of dialogue and other detritus focused more on overall flow than catering to djs their brevity suggested that akula had a beat-tape style album up his sleeve and in a way released under the name for seattles delivers on this promise the record is predominantly made up of tracks that appeared on the producers mix for the made like a tree series in october 2009 and thematically it sits quite close to the aforementioned eps albeit with a more broken rhythmic palette t draws heavily from an american and more often than not african-american context despite leaning upon dusted rhodes keys sirens street noise and clipped jazz and soul samples throughout akula manages to avoid issues of appropriation: is clearly a product of his own imagination practically every track features a film sample and this is vital to why the record ends up sounding so evocatively urban their prevalence lends the tracks a significant amount of atmosphere and akula does a fine job of creating miniature soundtracks for each perhaps a sensible analogy is with how jim jarmusch (whose down by law is sampled on the third track) basically created a movie out of wu-tang imagery in ghost dog akula may be mining the same sort of smeared nocturnal ambience and blaxploitation quotes as moodymann and theo parrish but his tracks sound both sketchier in structure and more deliberately polished in terms of actual sound than those of his american counterparts f has a noticeable flaw its that the tracks tend to blur into one another linked as much by cinematic overtones as their beats weary trudge highlights appear as fleeting elements the dazed organ melody on or the what do it mean dialogue on this cohesive mood is what made the tracks such vital mix components in the first place though so one can hardly fault akula for so ably preserving that sundown-town vibe

matt cutler bore a style all of his own with his debut album as shimmering collection of hip-hop tempoed instrumentals that made up lemurian an aural tribute to a sun-ripened neverland best illustrated by cover art featuring a striking blonde whose mirrored sunglasses are as much filled with palm trees as they are obscured by lens flare hinted at a producer who was working emphatically within his comfort zone peeling layers of sound away from sample sources and meshing them with classic synthesized chords and simplistic drum patterns his work was so heavily laced with a particular sound set that it caught the ear of werk discs boss ctress who duly signed him to his label for a second album ecstasy friends as you might expect from its title further exploits cutlers talent for sun-drenched beat-strumentals exposing once again the positive vibes he exudes so easily is a knowing stomp coloured with shards of a synthesizer that bobbles in and out of earshot as if it were being hastily cued on a channel fader by an overzealous dj with the disjointed waltz that the erratic wash creates sitting perfectly atop the stuttered rhythm and pounce on a more straightforward melody provided by flittering strings the former echoing their pitch with thick pads that eep out a sense of foreboding before the latter swells up into a twisted loop that gets pounded with big kick drums and bass that resonates like a didgeridoo album feels like it is at once as much of a throwback to the rich and joyful workings of pop bands like huey lewis news as it is to the catchy computer game melodies that were forever ingrained into the developing brains of children in the 90s its the mood along with the very similar sample sources that makes ecstasy friends a cohesive and rewarding listen track like s the lead giveaway single surmises this perfectly: its a colourful swirl of reversed pan pipes that get peppered with a lead line straight out of an early sonic the hedgehog soundtrack and a beat that stumbles along underneath hitting hard with each kick drum its an almighty clash of ideas and sound palettes but when shoulder pad bass patches go toe-to-toe with crystalline moog riffs inside this nottingham-based producers computer were all winners graciously basking in the rays of his happy-soaked beats

the unlucky 13th release on lmr comes from roccomundo o n n o as they deliver two new productions for sander s label the dj took pills is first up and it has quite a nice uplifting flow to it thanks to some pretty nice melodic riffs and pads smooth baselines keep the track flowing under the intense scrutiny of the melodic aspects making this a pretty good peak time number i love you is a little chunkier yet it still has a nice melodic touch to it with some subtle piano lines a soothing vocal riff and some upbeat drum patterns
not much is known of the mysterious swedish producer outside of his previous release on his self-titled label earlier this year but one thing is for certain: they know what theyre doing in the studio begins simply enough and without much fanfare continuing on its sparse path for the entirety of its ten minute length haunting atmospherics combine with the dark droning bassline to create a distinctly cavernous hypnotic landscape for the senses to get lost in the pace quickens on the flipside as both versions two and three of are more peak-time friendly version two while partially a sped-up version of version one retains the consuming drone aesthetic while adding a chugging acid line allowing astute djs ample time to bend minds version three ramps up the bpms considerably but also introduces a warped off-kilter time signature to the fold it makes for an unexpected end to a fantastic trio of techno variants
s debut lp a deeply imaginative take on modern soul is a tough act to follow offers the first glimpse into her next lp which remains unnamed its no great departure from what came before but it does hint at subtle changes in approach the beat produced by jd reid has a blunt limp and a bass weight that we didnt feel on yellow memories where instrumentals were coated in a layer of thrift shop dust outright electronic elements were often dialed back to leave room for s deep voice and the more traditional instrumentation on tracks like family and la neta her voice tumbled elegantly along with jazzy flourishes in the songwriting like she was sparring with the rhythm here chopped-up samples and muscular mpc beats take center stage and while her voice is as attractive as ever the arrangement and the songs arc make for an understated effect is an enticing taste of whats in store though it feels more like a b-side than a lead single
is there such a thing as obscurity through mass production thats what label head stefan goldmann called the effect of pete s enormous catalogue on most listeners i have to agree credit is due to goldmann then for bothering to wade through the ambient maestros deep body of work and pluck out this dusky gem is at a rigid tempo with slowly ambulating synthesizers the track opens with a repeated loop with spacey whooshes lending the proceedings a ian vibe the loop soon gives way to an extended breakdown with eventually combining the two parts into a grand finale of sorts simple stuff but like desolats recent reissue of sebbos watamu beach the secret lies in the fact that the track sounds as if it were composed yesterday compare any of innervisions forthcoming muting the noise compilation to and youd be hard-pressed to tell the difference french deep house auteur p p beefs up the original adding a hulking bass and accentuating the underlying funkiness of s first loop for a while at least s past two 12-inches have been concerned with s m themes and bird calls respectively while he doesnt quite get that far out the remix turns into a shuddering mass at around the three-minute mark as if its about to rip apart from the seams it comes back together just barely and then floats along its merry way to a completely normal conclusion because the beat is jettisoned for more than half its length i cant imagine many djs playing this mix out so for skittish selectors theres always which offers up more than three minutes of the p p s mix beat included either way both are excellent examples of why is simultaneously one of the most underrated producers around and why he may remain that way for years to come
if they chose to close up shop tomorrow the longevity of hamburgs would be one of contemporary dance musics heartwarmers (and i swear thats not a testimonial to the wistfulness of their music ) founded at the turn of the century by david lieske peter kersten and paul kominek three dance devotees who shared a taste for classic detroit techno and deep house records better known by their production pseudonyms and pawel has spent the past decade forging one of houses most iconic and recognizable imprints though theyve expanded their trademark along the way pulling in avant pop acts like / and and the classical shimmer of for the most part the labels prided itself on housing a core roster of producers concerned with particularly intricate and intimate brand of house and ambient minimalism founded upon a sort of beauty that seems easy to shatter the kind you wouldnt want to handle too crudely most dial producers have a talent for crafting similarly tactile and subtle late evening atmospherics surprise then that a quick glance at their tenth anniversary compilation reveals many of the names so long associated with dial label heads and alongside principals like du and its fitting then for a label thats staked its reputation to consistency of timbre even under an expanding roster that most of the dial vets turn in cuts worthy of the occasion in particular two producers not with the label at the outset who embody dials ability to remain relevant and (both of whom have albums coming on the label this year) have crafted minor showstoppers for the occasion is nocturnal sea drift house buried pianos and weathered chimes afloat against his brawny rhythms while s is similarly spacious with quiet hand drums and bass pulse slowly unveiling its wintry pad and drone melody elsewhere du s opens with stubby bass and wood tap samples before its infused with one of webers hypnotic bell patterns and s treads with the same slow melodic advance as much of last years until then goodbye on his first release for dial isol e turns in a piece of haunting twitch house in the fittingly titled all submerged effects pointillist drones and one quiet boom for a central melody if there are inevitably a few quiet duds on and what celebratory label compilation doesnt have them theyre overlookable in the face of so many dial regulars turning in such heady goods so the / and tracks seem like a forcible way of bookending the compilation in downier warm up/cool down textures; these poppier signings have never been the labels calling card anyway so feels a bit paint by numbers when compared to broad canvas creations by his labelmates for the most part is a compelling reminder of why the hamburg crews nuanced elegant brand of house music always felt so distinctive if your ears werent already perked for the and records coming soon thisd be all the reminder you need that dial ten year geezer in a scene prided on freshness can still keep up with hipper blogosphere darlings
from vampire weekends ghana-inspired motifs to lvs flirtations with kwaito the sounds of frica are as attractive to the wider world as theyve ever been hearing from the people who actually originated these sounds though is rare outside of compilations and reissues is one exception the solo (and sometimes band) project of cape towns john withers is somewhere between indigenous and pastiche instead of hewing to one style he jumps all over the map as likely to affect a south frican house strut as he is to nick a west frican guitar riff his self-titled debut album for has all the giddy reverence of a musical explorer plus a perky personality that makes it pretty much irresistible when hes not making music as withers works in a commercial studio writing jingles for a living this heavily informs the way he writes songs: for one his tracks are short and sweet we get 15 of em in under an hour nd he knows his way around a hook so they tend to get stuck in your head take the buoyant guitar that opens : it sounds just familiar enough to be exciting without feeling hackneyed not unlike what youd hear in a well-done commercial that said withers is far from one-dimensional his gift for simplicity applies to all sorts of musical modes; the albums first single is suave with its manicured guitars and saccharine vocals while is a vulnerable and heartfelt love song im imagines a caribbean groove as heard from the sahara topped off with a new wave vocal its touches like this that lend the record a multicultural flavour but thats not all down to withers he also partners with rwandan singer emmanuel nzaramba who delivers an authenticity and emotional flair that withers cant quite muster on his own bringing his music even closer to home several of the tracks are named after parts of south frica and like little aural postcards they all convey different themes most striking is named for a near-mythical town in the matola mountains thats prized for its gorgeous views the natives of were almost completely displaced (and out-priced) by white settlers and it remains out of reach to them today theres a certain emptiness to the song soaked in reverb and dramatic guitar strums and the quietly hopeful melody turns heart-rending when you know the story behind the village for a jingle writer whose album is almost relentlessly upbeat his music can cut surprisingly close to the bone
having impressed on skudge remixes part back in 20 0 new school etroiter is now the latest artist to be championed by the swedish techno duos sister label s each of the eps four tracks are given an entire side of 80g vinyl and feature more of the labels heavy-duty techno but this time with an acidic twist midnight starts things with suitable intensity with a timeless female vocal sample over warbling 303s and a constantly mutating frame of piercing highs and gunshot kicks wilsons penchant for percussive variance offsets the acute repetitiveness of the outer layers keeping the track buoyant true to its title treads much eerier terrain subaquatic synths rise from the depths and take on a life of their own the result is nothing short of deeply hypnotic 95 is the most obviously tailored to the dance floor with electrifying 303s laid over a galloping groove old school electro soon creeps into view with elongated slabs of synth further compounding the tracks agitated aesthetic lassic samples resurface on etroit s with loleatta holloways take me way refrain helping further augment the records fervent tortured soul itd be easy to dismiss the tracks sonic make-up as stock and exhausted but upon closer inspection it represents some of the most creative manipulation of the 303 anywhere in wilsons back-catalogue
when it comes to chunky house music few labels do it better than raw and rolling the outlets bass heavy sound makes for effective party music providing djs with no nonsense tracks suitable for all hours founders giovanni verrina and germano ventura collect tunes from and mr for s eighth release a four track compilation that should appeal to house djs who put rhythm first how much you value melody might determine which track you like best all four focus on shuffling drums and fat basslines its what happens on top that differs s 008 3 feels like the eps most considered tune thanks to deep house style chords that give it a subtle melodic flavour and mr use vocals albeit sparingly to spice up their contributions theyre dreamy and buried deep in the mix on s 008 2 and robotic on mr 008 4 a disco flavoured stomper built around a deep live sounding bassline that might be too obvious for some djs verrina and ventura supply otta s boomiest tune with 008 1 which is little more than a massive kick drum and heavy bass stabs it rounds off another solid entry to s reliable catalogue
returns for his third release after a ten year break and again its on fellow frenchman terence fixmers label s with first single ddiction theres a refined hazy quality to both sides cylic is full of hallway echoes imperceptibly building a patchwork of semi-ambient noise before sweeping it away forcefully to reveal the tracks striking skeleton highly resonant and rapidly-panning drum hits act like flickering fluorescent lights on the other side doubles the track length taking it up to 12 minutes long if was eerie footage of a derelict hotel this is an actual visitation its led by a tight forceful kick with low-end pops of air and electrical shimmers moving around the sonic canvas seemingly fading to nothing before jumping back left then right soft shaker introduced halfway is like carpet shuffling under foot and its companion hi-hat like pocketed keys jingling despite the driving kick its not exactly dance music; more like ambient to a beat

fter an impressively mature debut on prins thomass internasjonal in october last year appears on leipzigs records for his follow-up release picks up where the space line ep left off the title track awash with a dreamy slo-mo chug perfectly weighted funk lick eases it along accompanied by swirls of vaporous sound seeing us out with waves of beatless ethereal pleasure matalla conveys a striking confidence in his own ability shows a different side to matalla capturing him at his toughest and most incisive yet layering sparky guitar riffs over a burly framework the sample from ob dylans its ma (im only leeding) adds a fluid poetic touch to this effortlessly groovy affair mix mup and kassem mosse return as mm/km on the remix completely transforming the original to suit their mechanized tendencies militant kicks play out over hypnotic synth-lines while robotic splurges leave you stranded a million miles from where you began
for s five year compilation merican dance music vol 1 the label asked its artists to reflect on the scene by naming the challenges it faces mong the answers: few clubs no demand high dj fees limited safe spaces nd the impression within the us that most dance music sounds like diplo in the shadow of mericas pop factory and europes club industry building a house and techno scene stateside has always been hard so you have to admire for their commitment their records have come mostly from merican artists including gunnar haslam octo octa and the black madonna whose early eps surfaced on the label fter five years of helping define the scene merican dance music vol 1 sounds like a celebration of it bold chicago style tracks rule the compilation with each artist turning their ideas in this direction take philadelphias whose other work for 2015s mad blanc was mostly lush deep house on he delivers a jack track thats way ruder built on chunky rhythms and pitched down moans the duo of of rupert murray and the black madonna contribute the compilations biggest techno ripper is another midwest veteran whos recently returned to producing her track is a loopy acid cut with a sense of humor (the vocal hook deadpans: i like girls a lot ) still the unrelenting good fun on merican dance music vol 1 can also hinder it slightly the collection is heavy on the jack and pretty straightforward but s actual catalog has a range of more nuanced merican voices is one of these his isnt as strong as anything on his last ep but it still has an irresistibly uplifting tone same goes for s hes gone deeper elsewhere but the momentum here is plenty hot the raucousness doesnt stop until one of s more leftfield artists brings everything to a close on soft ambience and woody clatters drift by like morning fog more contrasts like this would have given the compilation an extra dimension but as a collection of party tracks merican dance music vol 1 would slam anywhere
if you want proof that s distinctive take on main room minimal techno is firing on all cylinders at the moment look no further than this ep rgentinean is a newbie on but he s also riding high after an excellent ep on crosstown rebels this summer dded together his recent releases create a feeling that purman is a name to watch oth sides of the are structured stark tech house cuts made from metallic roland tr beats and cavernous fx that recall the likes of plastikman nd while the grooves might be geared towards the dark end of the dancefloor the elements are balanced enough to keep the music uplifting: the ghostly fx find the right balance between order and messiness and the result is techno that never sounds samey or empty the -side is the more upbeat of the two creating an appealing sense of urgency with stark beats and ghostly pings and echoes while the -side is more rolling moody and melodic a nice tool for earlier on in the night
debut release from the franconia collective whod like amongst other things for their region to be known for more than just tasty gingerbread is divvied up between relative unknown and various aliases/comrades/side projects of up and comer iron despite the handful of names scattered on the b side of the platter both of its tracks bear the fingerprints of iron himself with the same diligent jacking but clean tidiness of everything hes produced to date joins with to create a third entity and their edit of skips with mid tempo house mirth and breezy sweet scented pads greatest strength of piafras re edit of lamours 1984 electro disco anthem lets tonight is in admitting that there isnt a great deal to improve on from the original effect of the rework then is like a favourite musty old item thats finally made it to the dry cleaners: there are fewer dust bunnies and a lighter brighter step plus a reshuffle that allows for keytar blasts and slap bass solos to have their moment in the spotlight while the presence of iron will likely pause fingers flicking through racks and scrolling through pages of new releases the piqued interest will hopefully flow over to s stellar pair of productions on the a side in comparison to his labelmate he seems more quietly knowing and quite unafraid to slow things down to skank them up a bit provides wonkiness in increments with teetering spidery keys dragged out handclaps and what sounds like tweeting birds all weighted down and deeply inebriated n theres it largely consists of two sets of key stabs hand claps and hi hats and the occasional papery sweep but everything else sung phrases conversations a bass line that rotates inwards and downwards occurs on the utmost periphery yet its neither underdone nor understated with the young producer mastering a balance of deep swing and tricky tempo with aplomb proving that cool head nodding ease isnt solely the result of many years spent in the game
ep further bolsters both s reputation and that of his label rather like the opening track from his last ep transparent mind kicks off unsettlingly its focus a wonky acid motif before submerging under a layer of rolling snappy breakbeats midway through the edges are softened by heady synth pulses and live percussion stefan robbers remix as terrace pushes it towards swampier territories all squelch and brutal thump is bang on the money joining the dots between dubby techno uk bass and deep house it emerges from a cloud of intricate percussion and thick heavily delayed analogue keys into a wide-open space of fat congas and stabbing synths in whats fast becoming an sagitarriun trademark its deep but bears its teeth too
with only two actual proper releases to her credit in the past 18 months (the l e 2009 wolf amb-sponsored whispers ep and the 12-inch for ) and a few sc tered remixes here and there sure has built up a name for herself for the most part her debut full-length only helps to solidify th impression first half of over displays a mastery of deep house tropes neophytes eza boyland queenie and kle anthony who all show up on the albums first third as guest vocalists are mostly used here as ghostly background figures th mirror kurtels often abstract tunes title track titill es for two minutes with an echoing cascading loop until the kick drum kicks in and boylands distant one-liner struggles to give the entire thing a sense of direction is just as peculiar: tiny tin-like beeps fall around queenies delic e murmur while displays the same kind of interest for the female an omy and hypnotic spoken-word as nina kravizs pain in the on the other hand with its prompt use of fake strings pumping bassline and chelonis r jones-like diva-ish p hos from the aforementioned anthony ends up sounding like a lost robert owens demo and is all the more compelling for it is one you may already know by now but it still deserves recognition in becoming one of the years defining tracks its warm welcoming and gracefully tuneful; the fact its mischievous bassline gets right to the point only helps enhance its soft-spoken immediacy and dont dilly dally either and both cuts come across as s distant yet vaguely sexy cousins albums second half is overall more adventurous and intriguing for instance brings a surprising twist to the long players arc with it brazen new wave guitar riff thrown in next to twirling pads and alarming synths a trick repe ed on the flo y yet tense is even weirder in the way it mixes dubstep-tinged rhythmic p terns and sampled horns it all shows kurtels vers ility something an exclusive cut like the quirky r b of crank it up recorded with gadi mizrahi and soul clap on their recent dj kicks compil ion also proved with convincing long players from the likes of jamie jones maceo plex and art department renaissance is in full bloom and kurtel is a heartening addition to the stables sound youd hope th shed devi e times from the six-minute templ e she sets for herself on these twelve tracks and it wouldnt hurt if she indulged her l eral stylistic urges more often since it suits her so well but the same time you cant deny has despite its flaws a fulfilling aura a feeling th makes you think th house musics freshest star might have just been born
s murder was the bass was quite possibly one of the biggest crossover trance tunes of 2003/2004 and featured on several mix compilations (judge jules picked it up for his trance nation harder cd) theres already been a couple of remixes out including a drumnbass remix by raiden and it was only a matter of time before the breakbeat community offered up a take and there s probably no better choice than audio bug label bosses move ya steve lavers one thing about move ya steve lavers sound is the very clean and crisp drum breaks and on their okm8 remix here they drop one similar to the one they used in the ride in fact the whole remix follows a very similar formula to that tune the original relied on a simple bassline with only subtle note changes but it was the dark overtones that gave it its appeal move ya steve lavers add to this their trademark breakbeat with percussive grooves and lots of techy filler for those who find the okm8 remix a little bland theres also a vocal remix which features vocal chatter like that in tricknoligists freak frequency from earlier in the year
this french imprint has continued to make an impression on people with a third release from habersham jacob todd which also got the biggest re-work weve seen yet from kosmas epsilon for the fourth release we see ricky ryan aka come up with the aptly named the original mix has a classy groove from its beginning as a soft collection of warm melodies arouse our interest a catchy bassline is added which starts to lift things while delayed stabby sounds take the fore ontop of peaky house rhythms the atmosphere is constantly changing with altering synth melodies that turns the sound towards a nicely pleasing summer vibe on the b-side is the paolo mojo remix which twists the original into something more electroish tweaking the originals vocal along with the melodies that take it to a different level with a neat breakdown of soothing pads and jittery synthlines this kicks into some broken beats which comes completely unexpected and takes the track off in an exciting direction

does anyone recall global underground s first artist album you know the one from pako frederik the dutch men it was called atlantic breakers; been out for a bit now really cool stuff with lots of ambient soundscapes and tranquil breaks if you didn t even know they had one its ok it seems that you re not the only one somehow it fell through the cracks and has been forgotten till now so now with the new single 45 minutes it looks like the label wants to bag two birds with one stone revitalizing a hidden gem while continuing the quest to diversify their identity three mixes and all of them keep the nuances of the original opening the gates is medway as he opts for a minimal-house interpretation minimal is certainly not for everyone as the first few initial listens leave you with a hole in your ear it feels like it lacks depth and the melodies are too spaced apart from the rhythm and grooves to really be affective for the dancefloor but for people who have an attention span longer than 5 minutes can appreciate this bed-spreading groove nothing gets rush early as the warm synths and claps work the pace going from slow elastic beats to well well that s about it medway keeps it constant in one place in time forsaking eye popping breakdowns and thunderous snares he instead takes you on a sail of clear waters very moody minimal music inspired by the sounds of a world that has been forgotten centuries ago the tribalistic wonders truly keep you enchanted something i didn t expect at all when i saw midways name for the remix duties but it certainly has become something i very much had wished for while the other two come from pako frederik the first remix is a bit dubby in nature however it never really progresses anywhere and you re just left wondering how long until you get to the next track sure you ll think the same goes for the midway mix but with that mix the grooves and rhythms are strong enough to keep it from being dull as calming as this track is it needs more layers: melodies rhythms beats or acoustics something at least to keep it from heading into a brick wall these two men have shown how talented they are but this remix doesn t do them justice at all there are flashbacks of electric calm breathing out but it doesn t feel like it s enough finally when you find yourself at the end of the line a reprise awaits for you ambient breaks finds its way again but it s strange because this is more upbeat and dynamic than the remix a coolcut that will finish the electrical currents as it leaves behind a crashing wave of light a good release that isn t a monster awake but a sleeping dragon that wants you to find you own way
are the duo of ale reis and jo o lee they live in sao paolo where they have a residency at the acclaimed d-edge club the fragments ep on audioflys supernurture imprint is only their second release but it speaks volumes about their confidence as producers the trio of originals here all begin with a sparse dark ambience but eventually metamorphose to yield different tech house flavors all geared for the dance floor the centerpiece opens like a sliver of cold apprehensive minimal ala minilogue before melting completely into its underpinning drone from this silent place it relaunches itself with a bristling synth that adds a sense of propulsion and warmth on the other hand uses greater resonance on the kick drums to give it a bigger sound and a housier feel the suspenseful opening wash slowly gives way to fidgety synth stabs and a m_nus-esque melody lies somewhere between the two it takes the glacial smoothness of and the taut melodic tones of and combines them with fractured samples and a touch of dub to complete the hat trick ironically its london duo glimpse on their remix of who forsake any dark atmospheres and add the greatest evocation of brazil by breaking the melody into hypnotic polyrhythms complete with party samples reminiscent of carnival in contrast to this airy route marc opts for a tight-knit techno approach dark and driving subtlety succumbs to pure intensity and bigger sounds sebastian s version of does the same: though its more sparse than forceful its still plenty urgent
follow slgs ruddy amazing caffine (if you dont have this in the box/laptop you re missing out) with another confident and correct floor-quaker is a persuasive peak-time weapon that follows the well-trodden build/drop/build/drop/etc path but dont we all need a bit more fun in our lives nyway this does what it does with enough smart to merit your attention t the lower-end an elongated evil 303 lick rubs shoulders with a doubled-up bassline and crisp jacking driving drums (the real key to this tracks success) whilst up top theres divilment-a-plenty going on pecan-referencing squeaky stabs herald the start of the action ahead of the four (four ) drops two of which cause serious hip bother thanks to the kooky melodic stabs and decidedly large squealing synths in the wrong hands this could be cheese but meindl remains just the right side of electro thanks to his off-beat programming and general techno-ness on ze flip is a more heads-down groove with a buzzy bassline spiffing percussive layers that doff a cap to chicago a wailing delayed siren unexpected schaffel-fuelled passages and head-spinning break that cares little for your conventional time signatures foolish earthling
the song stranger in paradise is embedded in popular culture tony bennett turned it into a hit single in the 50s and though there have been many covers since his sultry rendition is the best known the original song is from the musical which hit broadway in 1953 and the west end two years later but was originally written in 1911 as a three-act play versions of a complicated love story set in the era of arabian nights have been endlessly tweaked for changing theatre cinema and television audiences ever since its a fitting illustration of creative mutation which is the essence of s music for the toulouse native just about anything is fair game: jazz folk opera and beyond (check out his ra podcast for a good example ) what defines his furious breakcore hybrids is their poignancy and highly melodic content hes a bit of a class act in a scene thats often way too silly or ridiculously extreme isnt quite business as usual for on his classical references have been swapped for a musical theatre motif its still lush and cinematic though tangled up in digital breaks brashy bass and acidic tear-outs is proper breakcore ragga business thanks in part to dutch the best bit comes right at the end during the oddball banjo finale bristols is typically melancholic and screw-faced using a rmd favourite: folky piano scattered amidst the din is a spooky ambient track with just a few treated guitar notes a moment to catch your breath in between all the skanking the dub version of is rmd at his best shimmering and opalescent with a pulse that ripples instead of pounds this is breakcore at its most refined

deep is well overused in dance music commentary but its too apt a descriptor of eterkins music to avoid it lush and spacey since his debut as black jazz consortium in 2006 the queens producer embodied the aesthetic before it was cool and will likely keep embracing it long after trendier folks have moved on this isnt to say that hasnt been evolving in fact if youve seen him dj in the last few months youll have noticed that techno has become a big part of what makes him deep his sounds are still wafting into the mix from way out but like a burst of solar neutrinos theyre really starting to penetrate peterkins first outing for cavernous club music specialists embodies that shift its still undeniably a 12-inch but here his dive takes him farther down than light can penetrate the ethereal pads of earlier tracks have been roughed up for carrying twisted melodies through the tight spaces between kick drum thumps interspersed with rhodes flourishes also recalls his softer side though leaky-pipe drums and swelling electrical hums lend a sinister mood is all tension with an ethereal synth sounding a single chord that refuses to budge we finally get a little swing on but a strange vocal presence and a near-absence of melody make sure youll never feel entirely at ease
res no techno act who unites opinion like stanislav tolkachev ukraine-based artist has been a firm favourite of djs and producers for years now winning them over with a crunchy inimitable style that suggests a man at one with his machines built from jagged synths and puzzling drum patterns this atonal music is far from accessible only the very best selectors have the chops to make it work in a club setting that such challenging sounds remain loved by djs and producers alike is testament to tolkachevs talent his latest ep for is another affirmation of the producers status as a supremely captivating techno figure tolkachevs best records have come through labels run by great djs se selectors curate packages that showcase a large chunk of his sound which ranges from minimal and loopy to full-bodied and dynamic this is precisely the case with tolkachevs latest for svrecas label comprising three dance floor cuts and one ambient track is a trip further down the tolkachev rabbit hole which despite being abrasive is pleasantly diverse if youre buying this 12-inch with prospects of playing it out the bellowing is the cut to go for its the most maximalist track on the plate with chugging complex percussion and a face-melting synth is more stripped-back and subtle perhaps the closest thing to a dj tool tolkachev is ever going to release even so you wont find the usual techno hallmarks like obvious cues breakdowns or an easy-to-mix intro like some of his past few releases contains a poignant beatless track however unlike many techno records featuring ambient excursions feels like a vital piece of the picture its bright and positive with an unknown number of utterly unrecognisable synth sounds dancing around each other its hard to beat the raw emotion of tolkachevs more dj-friendly material but this six-minute track exudes feeling in a way his dance floor cuts simply cant match ep concludes with the dark and disorienting m a disturbing production that could clear a dance floor if not used carefully zeroing in on the overall appeal of tolkachevs music is tough at a basic level he may be universally admired because he reminds people of technos early days long before bursts of white noise drum rolls and big breakdowns became commonplace doing so tolkachev bucks technos oldest clich : he doesnt sound like the future but rather embodies an electrifying past
the man otherwise known as steven ford drops his premier track for londons label and as usual with the veteran producer its a leftfield stunner circular vaguely fro-latin percussion patterns; a whirlpool of exotic humid intonations; a minimalist touch of ghostly vocals; and a few handclaps for good measure bout is near-hallucinatory stuff conjuring up a deep summer late night vibe its a bit like an abstracted version of the voodoo house that murk was producing in the early 90s with about 50 layers of weirdness oven-baked on top its a lushly beautiful track as is bout which works with a similar sonic palette minus much of the percussion but with the addition of a driving rhythmic base and the subtly jazzy licks of a near-phantom rhodes piano theres a bit of a build as the track progresses but like bout its basically an eight-minute groove and also like its flipside its among the more beautiful deep house cuts so far this year
i do love the whole nu disco/re edits aesthetic of finding interesting and odd music and reworking it for a modern audience it s pluralistic it leads to fun and varied sets and it can be a real breath of fresh air compared to other more narrow genres one thing however that really gets my goat is the limited edition culture that goes with it the releasing of the choicest pieces in vinyl only runs of 500 or so whole scene is built around the idea that some djs have rare tracks that others don t so it makes sense for them to do this but it still smacks of elitism and i can t help also feeling that it s unfair to the artists to restrict sales like this rant over just needs to be said that this is a much more accessible and playable package than the non limited ep glimmers take the original and extend it the end result being basically indistinguishable from todd terje s mix on the other release first little bit of gold here though is the mayaku remix which dispenses with the club footed new beat drums in favour of an afro tinged breakbeat bravely they lose the famous bassline and build something warmer and more flowing by basing the melody around some of the sampled fx on the original finally the legendary jon da silva turns in a muscular acidic remix which augments the bassline with bleeps and squelches that give the track some wiggle and swing and uses backspin effects to bookmark changes in style and structure s a lovely piece that would sit nicely with a lot of rekids releases or equally well with the more twisted end of disco challenge now is to get hold of a copy
is s 30th release and one of a flurry of records to land this year from last year he joined the rotterdam crew with herdersmat s liner a slow-burning banger that stuck to muleros bone-dry driving style for his first proper record mulero goes in harder delivers the industrial chug acerbic sting and smashing warehouse sound associated with the label the gurgling title track might be the highlight pleasing the acid freaks who occasionally throws a bone to uses a similar set of tropes but theyve been submerged in deep chilly waters resulting in one of the best head trips on a record full of them insular tracks are rare on but as shows they can be just as powerful as the onslaughts

the young turks offshoot label debuted nearly a year ago with the low-slung house of terrons 001 ep its second release comes from a more familiar name: joe cowton most people would agree on the general high quality of the music has been turning out over the last few years although the volume of primitive sparing drum tracks he released was perhaps starting to paint him into a corner is the sound of him breaking out of that corner while keeping hold of the big subs and chewy melodies that made his name in the first place all three tracks are impressive not to mention quite different but the real standout is opener its twinkling foreground of soft keys and the titular percussion instrument blends beautifully with a looping vocal and lush skam-like idm pads its the most lushly textured track here the frantic hats dubby bass rolls pitter-patter drums and airy keys of see it skilfully walk the line between aqueous techno and regal house meanwhile is another triumph of assimilation where its bleepy three-note key loop and quick smart hats are pure detroit techno its groaning subs and abstracted vocal snippets look back across the atlantic to s english bass music roots with each new direction it takes becomes more exciting a statement of future intent for artist and label alike
remain and the duo populette have both peddled their disco-tinged house wares on new york juggernaut throne of blood of late their first official collaboration or as the vs on the label of the ep suggests ultimate studio battle finds life on remains own if the frenchman gets home-court advantage though hes not exactly lording it over andrew potter and max pask: both acts feel at home with the sort of live band-style stompers they deliver here never quite finds an easy hook but theres plenty thats catchy in this agglomeration of synth squelches shimmering drums and contagious hums troy pierce of items things delivers a remix that improbably maintains much of the originals live feel though his band sounds like robots playing instruments assembled in a 3d printer its excellently programmed giving you the sense hes actually playing his plug-ins off each other chloes mix is all about the simple pleasures snappy live snares in-the-pocket syncopation lick-happy disco bass it grows a little overstuffed as the track shuffles on but remains tasty like a particularly opulent hamburger marc pi ol the hivern discs up-and-comer goes a similar route to pierce even if his android band sounds more like guys wearing cardboard-and-foil costumes than actual circuit creatures
midland isnt the first among his peers to dabble with pop will saul who rd this lp for k7 released getting closer in 2013 george fitzgerald a regular on sauls us label alongside midland followed last year with fading love ll three artists have made sprightly music for the dance floor but their pop efforts are morose not so much a journey into the charts as an exploration of ailing souls maybe theyd work better without the glossy prepackaged sentiment or perhaps the clich s would float if the music wasnt so gloomy s a bit unfair to tar midlands new project with this brush for one thing is a band where his peers efforts relied on guest vocalists singer-songwriter robbie redway helps draw their music out of that awkward no mans land between the club and everyday life for another the duos reference points are more niche though the way they surface can be alarmingly direct when redway delivers a spooky falsetto over lilting idm beats on thom yorkes spectre hangs heavy on its wild beasts hayden thorpe haunting the speakers the foundations of are solid midlands drums are expressive and neatly syncopated the synth work colourful but restrained tempos vary and the duo throw in a couple of near-instrumentals ( ) to shake things up occasionally as on redways melodic sense feels strong though elsewhere ( ) he piles too much emotion onto flimsy lyrics only has one fatal weakness and its one of approach the prime building blocks of these tracks arent melodies or chord progressions but loops the duos linear arrangements could keep a dance floor chuntering along but they make for clunky pop songs the better ideas ( ) founder through excessive repetition and the gently downcast mood soon becomes stale isnt a total failure the question is as with its sibling albums before it whether it takes a wrong turn or simply doesnt go far enough
has really had a fantastic last 12 months with his productions popping up almost everywhere and making a very solid impact the second release on his rising imprint is a two tracker that is sure to spread his name even further fantasy sees chris take a little gritty approach with some tough electro basslines meeting some gritty vocal patterns in superb style the basslines are strong yet irresistibly funky much like changes and the sounds that create the main riffs as the track progresses are cleverly placed and produced solid stuff here from chris until she rises is another pretty solid production but not as strong as the a-side for me the flow is again solid with some smooth basslines and sounds the order of the day here but for me this production lacks a bit of the edge created on this release thanks to fantasy
it may sound absurd to say that an artist with several releases on his own record label could be a silent partner but compared to carsten nicolai and frank bretschneider olaf bender seems like the quietest corner of s owner/operator triangle but that certainly doesn t mean he s incapable of making sound on this release olaf takes his tone generators for a very noisy trip through minimal techno the obvious sonic referent for this ep is the rhythm-emphasising end of pan sonic s work with its of slow lulls and long buzzing headache tones beating against the febrile dreams of soviet-era transistors and the like being abused in the name of audio exploration all the versions of presented here can be used as dance music but the original was certainly not strictly written as a track (with all the necessary functional frequencies in mind) the beats bump and pulse at the right pace and in phase sure but the emphasis is always on the sound not the build in other words if you tend to prefer the tiger stripes remix of whatever ep you re unlikely to find much satisfaction with what a no-wave loving hard techno fan might consider to be a piece of stellar plastic in sleeparchive s hands olaf s textures are dessicated and multiplied while the claps are run through his signature empty corridor reverb dr s version manages to pull an arabesque melody (that might have always been there) into the foreground through the padded fug of reverbed and relooped beats there s also some nice beatwork which opens things up and this one might sound great on a big system (or give kool keith the perfect backdrop to drop some doom-rap) meanwhile back on earth nicolai s remix brings things a little closer to the medically precise electroid kling klang that frank bretschneider explored on his outstanding rhythm album (get it now if you haven t) it s a tight little slice of sine wave booty with plenty of sound-art junk in the trunk and the pick for me this is an interesting direction for and a very solid ep that really stands out from the dross noisy and nice
you can tell that s latest track comes from the same sessions as his recent lp and single for kontra musik the same crisp and strange sounds are used stitched into hyper detailed mosaics that fall somewhere between rhythm and mercurial melody but its also easy to see why was set aside for a separate release deep and aquatic but without the more disorienting qualities of vulkalaunai / wallouian its one of s prettiest tracks across 12 minutes he masterfully sculpts layers of bell tones bleeps and clicks over which delay trails ripple like heat mirages holding it together is an ascending melody rising from the bass to ring out in the high register like synthetic birdcalls the track is paired with a remix featuring percussionist and max loderbauer collaborator on whose label the record appears well remix is pushing it: the originals elements are mostly only present as rhythmic patterns performed by on a range of percussion instruments the structure theyre built into featuring improvised vocals from tora augestad is entirely new s drums are a departure from s usual synthetic sound world but theyre stitched together with the same attention to detail and the same ear for winding but purposeful structure augestad offers a few different wordless melodies at the opening before the whole thing descends into a smoky percussion workout led by a talking drum part that swerves drunkenly across the crisp 4/4 pulse the last few minutes settle into a more stable groove the live percussion gives it more bounce than s original but the post villalobos idiom is still unmistakably his
at their best theres something about the enveloping textures m rbeck builds into his tracks that makes them feel both dark and hugely inviting on he pulls off this trick as well as ever m_rec ltd label is known for the hypnotic quality of its releases and from the opening moments of this ep it seems that m rbeck intends to blend those sensibilities with his usual dark moods on the title track a huge menacing bass drum advances and retreats perpetually as a mid-register pad hums away at the back factory clanks and far off hydraulic wheezes add further atmosphere before the drums arrive to kick things into gear with its twitching ur keys is skittering by comparison but its background sounds allow it to retain plenty of ambience has a fairly similar character but adds a good deal of squelchiness thanks to a full-bodied bass loop and aquatic keys all three cuts are powerful tools with enough complexity and ingenuity to reward home listening too
before making pressed the reset button on his own practice the years leading up to this album the -based producer real name joni jud n released a string of eps for labels such as rinse and ptp (formerly ) most of those tracks were futuristic but functional drawing on grime hip-hop and experimental club music on his debut album those reference points have disappeared over the horizon arrives at a singular sound that unifies spellbinding audio collage with synth wizardry club rhythms and occasionally guitars album is full of seductive found sounds that invite us to explore their contours recalls the most poignant moments on dj shadows entroducing with a clip of hypnotizing movie dialogue everything going to be alright accompanied by piano strokes and yawning synthesizer tones has shades of shoegaze with a mournful chord progression that gives way to a solo keyboard arrangement swimming in woozy ambient noises and reverb jud ns versatility as a producer and songwriter is impressive not only he does he have a sharp ear when it comes to mining samples but he can write melodies that are full of feeling and agile rhythms with a soft touch most striking though is his way of evoking ambiguous moods that give the album a cinematic feeling the last couple of years weve seen more and more artists using the vernacular of club music drum machines samples and synthesizers to make stuff that not only sounds good but actually conjures up specific images and emotional states from the 14-minute audioplay that put mnesia scanner on the map to elysia cramptons demon city which seemed to illustrate a world of the same name to the three-dimensional blockbuster sound design of labels like finite machine or janus these projects are as poetic as they are musical this style is still going through growing pains however with many of its adherents stuck to hollywood sound design tropes breaking glass and twisting metal are what anger sounds like; high-definition bass drops are dramatic plot inflections; dissonant tones create tension; algorithmic noise make us think of the future whats nice about is it uses sounds in an illustrative fashion without leaning on the audio clich s drilled into our heads by the institution of theatrical sound effects album isnt just heady ambient tracks h is like a disassociated rap instrumental with 808 snares snapping in a cybernetic jet stream has a solid foundation of sub bass and an arsenal of metallic percussion with synths that are in turns optimistic and foreboding built on an overdriven bass guitar riff is more post-rock than post-club it may sound scattershot but finds a unifying factor by focusing on mood and texture whether hes arranging guitars field recordings or both
technos coupling with this year reached a peak that could almost be called trendy but some artists have been touting their entire careers including mannequins others like lucy have not adrianis signing to feels like a modish move but like its best records is esoteric techno in line with and lucys own ideals like the label he runs adrianis productions cut through time and genres mashing up the old with the new to become the music of now as he told me earlier in the year captures the italian at a particularly introspective moment conveyed most potently on which utilises airy elements and minutiae details grungy version of sits at the other end of the scale its heavy dark and will appeal to adrianis vintage-leaning fans nestles somewhere in between as a piece of tough high-octane techno that makes modern use of a dusty sound pallet original is a haunted 808 workout that exemplifies why this is such a stroboscopic record
has held quite the poker face several years into his career hes still smoke and mirrors to most people even the redeemer which dealt with brutally honest heartbreak could feel impenetrable like it was keeping us at arms length blunts sampling style is part of that the borders between borrowed and original material are completely non-existent and the dreamlike feel of his music means it doesnt fit into any one style or era (named for the material not the genre) isnt different in that regard but its more sanguine bringing us in for something more private and profound while the redeemer was often wound up and defensive is emotionally all over the map blunts baritone is more expressive than ever dripping with derision bristling with indifference and quivering with sadness his gravelly command stay out of it on is serious; on he sounds like hes trying to stave off a breakdown and are both acerbic dub tracks and the latter is especially biting broaching themes of crime and police while joanne robertson yowls and moans she plays a major role on drizzling guitar over a sunny pastels sample on and sinking into the couch alongside blunt on the haunting the latter unravels with every passing measure as their drawling duet of i aint worried bout nothing leads the lp into its heady midsection pulls the very move of curbing its own momentum with two dragging-feet epics the 13-minute is a stark monument in the middle a defeated march of rattling drums atonal vocals and bleating horns is the angry fit that follows with synths that hit like blasts of ac as blunt spits and barks his lines that bitter mood dominates the rest of theres harsh spurting techno on (where in a bit of fourth-wall breaking we hear blunt turn the volume down on his macbook) and terse rapping on it all comes to a head with a brooding opus of post-punk synth and wailing saxophone thats one of blunts most intense works yet as fades out you feel like youve experienced a full spectrum of emotions expressed with little or no filter blunt is often called a prankster for his confusing and intentionally distracting antics with hes pulled a fast one on us by delivering something so intimate sure the lp has its eccentric moments and it takes a long time to really get to know but as the redeemer hinted and proves beneath all the youtube sampling bizarre press and one-off russian blog releases blunt is a talented singer-songwriter with a keen ear for odd sounds its telling that was preceded by a comprehensive interview in the wire which portrayed him as an unpretentious everyman sitting on a bench in a park in its own stubborn way is almost as direct

when you hit that magic number you know you ve been doing something right as global underground has been the trendsetters of the underground with their polished mix series they have been on the forefront of the new wave of artist to dominate clubland and to celebrate their 10th release for their original music line they have taken one of phonique s brilliant tracks off of his album as well as the notorious fundaction from sasha s own mix cd in kick starting the single comes the previously unreleased version by henry saiz darker and heavier overtones are the foundation as saiz s mix tweaks the original to a naughty electro groove crunching beats that follows with the main melody key that slips underneath it all gradually breaking through the beats to give the track a bit of life; with the voxxed-out vocals manipulating alexander east s voice adds a bit of flare but it overalls falls short as it doesn t have enough variety within the seven-plus minutes saiz had doing the remix i:cube s mix could easily be said the same as saiz s remix but there s a much livelier sound a much more happy-lets-wave-our-hands-in-the-air mentality with the jamaican themes firmly in place you almost feel like whipping out a set of jamaican drums and join in along with i:cube smooth and easily digestible to any crowd this is and has been a crowd pleasure for the last few months finishing the single is the original from phonique himself taken from his artist album identification the silky smooth vibes entice a slow burner for lounges and clubs nothing goes too fast nor does it slow down to a point where it dulls out allowing 99 to pace its grooves in any and many different rooms certainly a must have for any gu fan as the label knows good music

so much drum bass is obsessed with vaguely sci fi ideas of future you know the regulated churn of machinery the shine of chrome the dystopian hell that surely awaits us all but in practice such tracks can often come off as stiff and unfriendly s auxiliary crew are one of the few who do it with real feeling as they riff on the melodic sensibilities of the short lived autonomic movement thats as clear as ever on the third /unveil release which tempers unusually militant rhythms with gorgeous sound design and melody and even if the sound of the series hasnt changed since the last installment in 2013 with tracks as strong as this its difficult to complain s work has recently been creeping towards ambient techno but is no nonsense drum bass and one of the heavier tracks hes released in a while and with hip hop scratching rapped vocal samples and synths that shoot across the bars like theyre being fired from a laser gun its even a little playful res nothing so lighthearted on s which sounds like hes trying to drive the track into the ground one of auxiliarys secret weapons offers a typically emotive twist on the formula with but its another of the labels underrated acts that truly nail it with a vast array of clicks buzzes and time stretched sound effects is like some crazy idm track mapped to the more rigid structure of drum bass its exactly the kind of thing auxiliary is so good at
the one real dance track on self-titled debut was which featured drums far more up-tempo and a structure a lot more recognizably verse-hook than what surrounded it so to make up for it alessio natalizia and sam willis throw to colleagues who act on the idea that the primary difference between chain reaction and flying saucer attack was always primarily in the drums infant swipes a handful of instrumental flourishes and turns the track into something a four tet fan might like: crazy-looping melodies over a sturdy affirmative pulse not to mention bass so big its as if it were trying to hug you nathan s four-minute ambient version will with luck head straight to pop ambient 2011 : artificial strings play a melancholy fanfare one whose notes seem to disappear as quickly as they come in thats a taster for s 10-minute long-dark-tunnel epic it hurtles rather than glides and thats its appeal; i kept flashing back to hard early 90s germany happily the mix by londons radiant meanwhile takes direct cues from krautrock and fripp/eno while maintaining a four-to-the-floor beat though the snare-heavy climaxes make it feel a little more rock truffles epic stoner mix starts out like an anomaly in this company pinging triangle dirt-swallowing low end and a clean surface thats soon muddled up good by finely-sliced wafts of ambience and fog-like voices when the bottom comes back after dropping out a while the song seems to have slowed down dude whoa

s death by misadventures released earlier this year was lush dramatic ambitious and sometimes overstuffed with a distinctly nervisions-influenced approach that crossed detroit techno with acoustic instruments and soaring vocals in epitomized the albums sensual excess with churning carl craig-inspired arpeggios and billowing vocal harmonies reminiscent of le mystere des voix bulgares a world-music album popularized by its reissue on 4ad (and later nonesuch) in the 80s king s remix does a good job of stripping it down and thinning it out the vocals ride prominently in the mix but the drum track has more bite and more spring; the bass is reduced to a low ominous rumble and the arps add silvery highlights while shakers and crisp claps keep it all rolling effortlessly forward theres still a whole lot of emoting going on which may turn off some but its skillfully handled s own wisely dials back the intensity a notch; its moody and softly stepping with glancing chords ringing metallic percussion and downy pads that radiate color the outlier on the ep and for my money the strongest track is a remix from l i e s affiliate steve of the album closer the original was a mostly beatless ambient track (with the exception of a brief explosion of rock drumming) in the vein of dead can dance; threads it with silvery acid counterpoints lays down an understated 4/4 kick and blows out the vocal harmonies through canyon-sized reverbs it couldnt be simpler or more effective

beware the catchphrase disco an a r marketing term pure and simple even those that created and celebrated the musical form shied away from calling it that; cuso deemed it party music (and for a man who never spun inside a glitzy discotheque who could blame him ) too often the word has been abused on compilations of all sorts what amateur discophile digger has never picked up a colorful jamaican record sleeve with the word disco writ large across it beckoning nothing but promise only to find a normal reggae shuffle wiggling within its grooves comps like soul jazzs 2002 reggae and the miles cleret curated nigeria funk special (from 2008) revealed that the word disco has different connotations in kingston and lagos their beats slinking but never quite synching with a classic disco beat from philly or new york so for as much as i appreciated the massive archeological digs that frank voodoo funk gossner embarks on (documented at mouthwatering length over at his voodoo funk blog ) i was skeptical when i read about him compiling his own set of nigerian crafted disco odysseys i was expecting funk and nothing more but one look at an open mouthed on the cover of as well as the odd cellophane sticker that advises listeners to drop your pants before dancing to this non stop afro disco should excite and quell reservations in any doubters gossner may not have dug up the nigerian tom moulton or chic but the 12 tracks here find the bands well versed in the sounds emanating out from new york discotheques as lagos music journalist dean disi notes in the liners: there was a diametric difference in the music of the discos and the music played by the groups music as played by the djs was essentially western the young nigerian groups were hooked on it and tried to play it but with a distinctive stamp of their own so titles like and are to be expected and theres a palpable delight in hearing how the flute driven by winds up at songs end approximating kc and the sunshine bands shake your booty or how (who began the decade as a heavy psychedelic outfit) changed with the times putting in a serviceable break on might be one letter short of mfsb but their easeful pleases nevertheless the tricky bassline and raspy vocals from on falls into that early 70s nebulous category before distinctions like rock funk r b and disco were codified the real winner here comes from cover star ms who puts in a scorching/ screeching 14 minute workout called that would wow adventurous djs from any era with its non stop drive which is to say its true disco
prins thomas reserves full pupp for the proggy snaggletoothed disco from fellow norwegians; the sound of sister hub meanwhile is more concise drifters rock and coastal californian fare consider it a kind of recovery rock for the night owl set the balm for the after-burn for the imprints second full-length thomas turns to southern oregonian brandon johnson to close the summer with a record of analogue constructs that will have fans of this stuff thinking fondly to the summer of oh eight when similar lps by windsurf hatchback and lindstrom deluded many of us to believing we were in for a renaissance of these kind of sunny getaway jaunts arrives amidst summers quick fade but its the kind of seasonally-bound album that we just havent seen so enough of this year with studio on whats increasingly looking like a permanent hiatus smalltown supersound and claremont 56 in relative silence and both pt and pal lindstrom sucked into the black hole of the summer festival set there seems to be a dearth of good beach-bum disco records this year (terjes immaculate snooze 4 love an obvious exception) while johnsons certainly not as sure-footed as those ive mentioned hes accredited only with one previous song compiled by both ghostly ternational and moongadget his self-titled debut as mixes analogue sandy-toed am gold pop with short boombox disco jams and top-down balearic rock at for example has all the thumb-pressed tension of a spring awaiting release with a buoyant bass roll and simmery synth spots with its hip-hop patter and dizzying synth waves takes the time to curve through series after series of interwoven melodies and detours while with bed-head acoustic guitar strumming and astral blurts of synth sets out to capture in audio the very moment your evening shades from dusk to pitch dark takes this shift and as the title indicates separates you from your earthbound view with its distant lunar melody in sharp contrast to the tracks growing disco swagger another acoustic guitar-oriented stroll mines the sort of easy bliss you might have found in the permanent vacation camp a few years ago; is sharper not as red-eyed a straightforward bit of star-dazed electro-disco that closes the album in as jumpy a mood as johnson sets anywhere else here it may arrive a little late to really quench our annual thirst for this brand of audio escapism but is a promising debut for a virtual unknown; perhaps one last fond glimpse of a summer turning soon crisp and leaf littered
bruno deodato is a regular but the labels most successful approach to tackle big-room convention from an idiosyncratic angle has so far eluded him on he touches on it at least in places the lead track is about as graceful as an oil tanker its elements accruing at a painstaking speed well after the four-minute mark it finally hits its stride through a series of hi-hat washes and an extremely long breakdown but the materials themselves are much stranger than their deployment would suggest the drums are loose and unvarnished the bassline a distorted groan a sampled monologue offers the sort of sinister downpitched aphorisms youd expect to hear in a shackleton track pursues a similar outcome but theres little to carry it beyond a desultory bassline locked s remix of the track takes a hex key to it tightening its structure until it takes on a compact techno form the plangent idm synths in the latter half are a nice touch but its hard to wring anything truly thrilling from such nondescript stuff
the next release on steve lawler s imprint comes from a belgium producer under the alias of a somewhat veteran producer he has had releases under different names on labels such as hooj nulife positiva and reload just to name a few the vibe is first up and it is quite upbeat from the word go nice percussive elements unite well with a funky baseline and a vocal hook that is somewhat seductive much like the baseline and funky riffs on the flip is korason a track which ups the tempo a little bit from the a-side more on the progressive tip this production uses a nice solid baseline alongside some more tribal influenced drum patterns as the track progresses the atmosphere gets noticeably deeper as deep atmospheric effects increase in the background alongside a somewhat chanting vocal sample and this unites very well with the baseline that comes thrashing back into the production a pretty good release here on recordings with two productions that are definitely not short in the funk department

back once again with the ill behaviour has come out with their second instalment of if it ain t broken don t fix it appropriately titled if it ain t broken don t fix it too after the first highly successful volume too delves deeper into the crates labelled locals and extracts a nice variety of tunes spreading across all subgenres of the breakbeat spectrum on the funkier side of breaks musiq for pleasure s intergalactic mystery is a sampladelic number sitting on top of a phat breakbeat it s like a meeting between the drumattic twins and the avalanches the latter being attributed to the freaky old skool funk samples layered on top and the former responsible for the kickin bass drums and fuzz bass ransom s remix of brewster b s hanky panky the soul shaker shows that the tummy touch influence is coming out thanks to a wicked double bass line accompanied by an organic breakbeat if you slept on these guys on the last freaky loops cd then wake up as ubin take a trip back to the 80 s with the electro styled peep - look out for the funkin bass line coupled with the old skool synthesiser melody reminiscent of arthur baker s work with planet patrol scrambler represent a more nu-skool approach to the compilation with the techy 813 similar to the styles of nubreed a wicked tune and scrambler lives up to their name by scrambling and splicing up the beats during the breakdown speaking of nubreed the lads themselves have cooked up a fine remix of summer breeze for phil k s free radicals project the lads from infusion make a double feature on the compilation with their latest marine parade release dead souls a proggy four to the floor house/breaks affair with a distinct rock flavour to the beats dead souls pays it s tribute to classic electro while keeping itself firmly planted in the styles of today on a solo mission is fex jumps aboard the last train to show off this chicken lips inspired electro breaks tune keltec mangan are proving to be quite a team as they make another appearance for volume 2 with another female vocalist on itsachickthing - dark and moody on a tribal tip cd 2 is a mix cd done by competition winner cairns dj jeremy judd you can read the individual track profiles here from a previous review being a compilation which is only 10 tunes strong having to make a mix cd from it is pretty hard work and jeremy s only done it with 8 with puretone s addicted to bass and lo-step s tune both excluded from the final selection big ups and here s hoping that more budding dj s are willing to showcase their skills at the same time offer their support for our burgeoning breaks scene a series designed to showcase australian breakbeat talent in all respects; if it ain t neatly highlights and arranges all forms of breakbeat mayhem into one volume and aussies are getting better at it - this volume is better than the previous one

with so many producers in the bass music realm making starry-eyed r b from scraps of pop culture its about time they started making their own isnt it montreals has provided some of the best examples of the stuff and he seems to have gotten the memo with the inaugural ep for his new label lead track contains all the familiar ingredients: heavy house kicks bright synths and buoyant basslines but everything feels porous and breathy leaving room for an impressive full vocal from fellow montrealer its a rare example of a dance music track living up to the kind of r b imitated and adored by these producers in the first place the other three tracks are typical instrumentals but theyre bolstered with a confident sense of aesthetic thats why is reducible to a formula yet so impressive in execution: when those high-strung arpeggios chirp and that sped-up vocal start looping around maniacally you cant help but be dazzled is a minimal bumper recalling his work on night slugs but the nine-minute closer does it one better a collaboration with scottish newcomer inhales and exhales gently mixing the control of dynamics and empty space the scot displayed on his debut single for pictures music deftly into greenes array of drowsily pulsing rhythms

release number 6 for upcoming bristol based breakbeat label keeps things in the hood with a new tune courtesy of two bristol based producers kraymon (streetwise en:vision) and 30hz - one of s stable artists side v kraymon 30hz - drug noise this tune kicks off with a chunky percussive break leaning towards tribal beats with a thick mixture of conga drums deep hollow snares and a wobbly tech sample after the buildup a technoid monotonic bassline kicks in combined with plenty of tech effects sinister male vocal samples and sharp hi hats according to kraymon and 30hz if drugs made noise it would sound very dark and moody side s 30hz - hell the flipside features an bleak monotonic electro bassline which appears in a tame form during the introduction as with drug noise the bass is accompanied by tribal drum beats and heavy breakbeats making good use of hard hitting snares during the first drop the bassline transforms into a freak of nature getting tweaked and morphed into some electro beast with razor sharp slices put to interesting use
next up on eq grey is a track that first appeared on phil k s brilliant balance 004 mix by finally gets a release with a devastating lo-step mix on the b-side the original mix is quite an emotive breakbeat production the beats are not too intense with the vocals and smooth and subtle piano lines being the main focus the nicely arranged strings and smooth baselines work well with the changes in vocal tones indicating how well produced this track is the a-side also features some vocal accapellas for those who are willing to put the vocals to good use on the flip is lo-step s high school reunion of 95 remix now when phil k and luke chable get together it is always a shit hot and exciting prospect this remix is no exception from the word go the beats have purpose and the baseline that rides underneath the track is exceptional and really gives the track a great flow the vocals are worked to great use for the first half of the track before the track takes a different direction midway in the breakdown sees the vocal go solo and after that the beats get muddled and twisted for a few minutes slowly introducing a real highlight of the production a massive string induced conclusion it is clear to see why this is called a 95 remix as the last few minutes are a flashback to the days of stunning string patterns and pure emotion brilliant eq hit the spot yet again not only with the nice and soothing original but also with the purely innovative lo-step mix that you can t help but adore
when arnold schoenberg devised twelve-tone serialism in the 1920s he claimed it would ensure the supremacy of german music for the next hundred years similarly founder wolfgang voigt has always been about creating a distinctly german form of music although this time not in opposition to atonal composition but to anglo-american pop the result has been twenty years of techno records defined by what voigt has humorously described in the wire as boofta-boofta-boofta a sound which he claims represents the deep soul of german techno following an epiphany with uk acid house in the eighties voigt pursued this project obsessively producing literally hundreds of tracks under almost as many monikers plenty of these records were released in series form each with its own conceptual agenda although all are united by that omnipresent 4/4 thud distinct from the dance tracks is voigt s project which had a more ambitious agenda: the aim was to produce ambient/experimental tracks by running german cultural history from schlager to wagner through a sampler this same process defines the sound of all releases: voigt creates loops of crackly brass and woodwind phrases and then obscures this source material with dense layers of processing smearing the sound into a hazy bloated wash that shimmers like the blurred contours of a rothko painting underneath all of this is often an unwavering bass drum the pulse which gives the clouds focus nah un fern is a collection of the four albums voigt produced for mille plateaux in the late nineties now subtly remastered and lavishly repackaged for voigt s own label for all its coherence a clear sense of development can be discerned through the series the first moment of is archetypal a thick symphonic chord but the rest of the album is more tentative: track 2 (all pieces on all albums are untitled) has the same aquatic chug as wassermann here lost at sea; while track 4 is equally jarring pairing stockhausen s loom from trans with the spit and crackle of fire by voigt s methods have become more focused closely evoking the dark blood-red forest found on the cover track 1 is again beatless with the crunch of leaves underfoot accompanying a rich drone which like angelo badalementi wavers between hope and dread on track 3 large groupings of what once might-have-been strings swoop down into a vast orchestral mass knocked further astray by a skewed waltz reference track 5 starts out in s hk mode with nothing but a kick and a spectral pulse panning the field; while track 6 rolls turbulent thunderous waves over planes of strings and possible snatches of chorus ends as it begins beatless but here the air of calm signals the release of death with its golden cover evokes a sunnier hue but again the mood is ambiguous tracks 2 and 4 both contain brief melodic fragments whispered chiming notes which float up the scale but these are weighed down by a dense low-end undertow track 4 is even heavier a long low growl akin to the industrial drones of thomas koner or deathprod with its strident horn overture riding triumphantly over white noise track 5 is one of s more dynamic moments smearing wagners das rheingold onto the muddied walls of an abandoned discotheque 2000 s was voigt s final and most assured statement as but its also his most perplexing the grey static is gone replaced by viscous streams of flickering colour but these are so rich as to be blinding the opening two pieces are almost indistinguishable a restive downpour battered by warped synth phrases and reverse cymbal crashes some of the most beautiful music ive heard beats appear on only two tracks including the finale an epic march whose dusty shifting forms axel willner would study to form the field coinciding with reissue of a number of seminal early detroit albums this welcome release hopefully represents a growing interest from younger listeners in exploring technos more exciting peripheries is a towering work a profound meditation on music and history it s what schoenberg would produce if hed lived into the sampling age

soul jazz celebrate the success of their box of dub compilation with the release of a limited edition heavy-vinyl 12 from dubsteps most celebrated prodigy ep is just two tracks but its a good yardstick of s abilities covering his more mature side as well as the playfulness found on some of his album tracks its a record that suggests that all of s successes haven t yet taken away from his youthful joy and creativity -side is the better of s two tracks from box of dub is a brooding and cinematic piece of sci-fi dub that opens with forlorn stabs that echo out into ambient space in all directions sandy flashes of anxious rhythm phased hi-hats and dramatic fades all add up to a perfect party track that is signature on the b the is a lighthearted tribute to the favourite beer of jamaica and by proxy england brasher and less engaging than its a solid track nonetheless build on magic show special effects a simple horn riff and later a comic fat man bass carnivalesque and brimming with character the is the sound of cheap drunken mayhem more nice work from the master
laurie osborne has long been one of uk dance musics most vital figures his influence is usually channeled through others though whether that meant running skull disco with shackleton or collaborating on productions with a large number of peers (peverelist komon and geiom to name a few) his long-awaited debut solo ep felt anticlimactic in 2013 presenting three complacent house tracks that didnt reflect his legacy two years later he returns on with an ep that is undoubtedly the weirdest thing the dubstep outpost has ever put its name on more importantly it highlights osbornes peculiar dark side better than anything hes released in the past few years is named for a neolithic monument in englands southwest the ep is a document of osbornes visit there inspired by julian copes the modern antiquarian and in its own way it adds to a rich history of occult british folk music obsessed with the isles prehistory at first pass is dense and gradual miles removed from the glossy house of osbornes recent work theres a garage heartbeat at the centre of it but it moves with a lava flow sensibility that smacks of other english dreamers like luke abbott or nathan fake osbornes crystalline synth work adds gritty texture to the slow creep add in field recordings and a drum circle from the west kennet burial chamber and its one of s most singular pieces of music the flipside holds two beatless tracks is a nice piece of ambient music with a motif that feels blurry and distant taps into the same well of genius as the title track more texture than music its an engrossing 10 minutes that puts the spotlight on osbornes field recording techniques evoking images of haunted ruins and past worlds as discrete chunks of melody occasionally pass by its a reminder that osborne isnt only a great dj and solid club producer but also a forward-thinking artist with an experimental streak skull disco might be a distant memory but points to an exciting new epoch for
fresh from his part in that quality depeche mode bootleg of only when chirs micali is given the opportunity to really prove himself with 2 original productions on chris fortier s records on the a-side is l evasion and it begins with some very nice and solid beats and subtle electro hook whispered vocal snippets soon haunt the production as the track enters the deep end accompanied by some subtle melodic tones an interesting production you can t help but feel that this track would work quite well depending on the tracks around it in a mix as it doesn t shine brightly enough on its own it does shine however making this more of a mid set builder out there on the flip is again quite impressive but nothing amazing the baseline is a nice touch as it throbs its way into the production again micali uses some nice subtle melodic tones especially a little deeper into the track where the baseline also increases in its intensity overall it must be said that this track is a little more impressive as the a-side and definitely a little more energetic not a bad couple of tracks by proving that he is more then capable at doing the trick on his original productions
is a new label hailing from brooklyn though its inaugurators cromie sage caswell come from la you wouldnt guess either place judging from their music which sounds like it came straight out of the uk the duo channel their influences into a pleasingly individual sound that combines the swing of uk funky the buoyancy of kwaito and the earthiness of classic american house with some smart remix choices also included its not a bad way to start a label is the rager of the two but its deceptively lightweight riding its chord progression steadily upward as if it were floating the elegance of the synths is contrasted with softly squelching acid and the sharp metal of the drums ghosts s remix is less ethereal but still glows as he repurposes the groove into a stabby house banger looking to the classicist side of us house has an almost gospel tinge to it with a rising choir sample that occasionally surfaces over the staccato beat kyle works his magic on a particularly clever remix smearing the soundscape with his signature grit and adding whimsical synth doodles that evoke his earlier smoother tracks like you know what i feel south african producer dj spoko a perfect match for cromie sages rhythmic globalism puts his own perky spin on it bringing it closer to the funk of
it might come as a surprise to see samrai and ruf dug working together although both are established figures on the manchester scene they seem to issue from wildly different sonic worlds solo and as one half of production and promotion outfit swing ting samrai is a devotee of the uks rowdy mongrel musics with a svelte discography touching on dubstep garage uk funky and grime ruf dug meanwhile taps a different tradition running from classic disco and chicago house through the maverick sonics of theo parrish and the 00s edit craze it would be reductive to say that the two meet in the middle on this ep for unknown to the unknown the dane bank observatory is the name of dugs suburban studio after all but the common ground they settle on is fascinating nonetheless is nimbly poised between each artists world its dulled clap and buttery chords suggest a deep house slouch but restless kicks and a diced amen break muss things up a treat its all bound together by what sounds like an early chicago house diva wailing her way through a bathrooms worth of reverb and a thicket of synth strings the result is somehow both glossy and scuffed light-footed and jarringly sluggish unplaceable in other words in the best possible way is less fluid its stilted halfstep beat and minor key bassline suggesting a blunted spin on certain uk signifiers then again theres all that synth work which couldve been taken from some forgotten boogie gem a pair of remixes from mood huts hashman and melbourne duo zanzibar seek the firmer ground of house music proper hashman just takes the prize with nine-odd minutes of almost pathological pleasantness
i really don t need to mention the great form have been displaying and it is with this good form that the label hits its 10th release with a couple of tracks from the duo of grayson shipley and lee pattison that make up the first of these tracks is we came here to dance this is some killer funky electro stuff with rippling electro melodies meetings deep rumbling grooves as well as some clattering beats funky at one spectrum yet chunky at the other end this track is sure to do the business on the dancefloors in a similar vein that dave robertsons release on cuba a little while ago did on the flip is the white isle (feat amie karlsonn) the beats are again smooth but in this instance the baselines are very deep and chunky as the rumble their way through this production while the low end sounds do their work some fantastic string patterns provided by amie give the track quite a great summer vibe these two tracks combined with various dj tools make this quite a good release for the label and definitely a worthy release for the label to enter double figures with

the biggest influence here in cologne in terms of labels is kompakt says dj tocadisco sounds like a tough place to live when you re a one dimensional electro-by-numbers guy but all credit to him tocadisco has made it through some catchy (and timely) reworks of mylo and the egg a few years ago roman boer muscled his way into the burgeoning electro house scene and has since become superstar s cash cow his recent black series part 2 was surprisingly good tech house but alas this record sees tocadisco climb back on the electro-cheese horse is unoriginal and abrasive for the most part with the only respite coming when chelonis r jones vocal goes to work in the breakdown laid over some rhodes and strings predictably it returns to the electro stuff to close but here s where it gets interesting the remixers are audiofly extrawelt and crookers audiofly takes the cut down a few by deepening it and adding more warmth they replace the abrasive whines with hypnotic synths and jones s vocal is reduced to monosyllabic stabs it s a classic tech house sound perfect for warm ups extrawelt turn out a very familiar sound centered around yet another extrawelt heaving bassline with some gorgeous melody work overtop unfortunately it becomes monotonous quickly with the bass pattern remaining unchanged for the entirety lastly it s electro s latest darlings crookers their bi-polar take on the genre is pure fun and a breath of fresh air their remix makes chelonis r jones vocal the focus to which they contort around squealing lines and a rocking bassline crookers are rave to the point of hilarity and i for one am all for it tocadisco knows what he s doing his easily swallowed tracks are prefect for the spoon-fed masses and is no exception but the remixes are worth checking out 4/5 for audiofly and crookers 2/5 for tocadisco and extrawelt 3/5 and lets call it a day
venetian house label back forth like to share their releases so each of them is a bit of a mixed bag aka greek producer petros manganaris side of the 12 inch jumps off with what sounds like the kick and snap of inxs i need you tonight before simmering down into mournful minor key deepness vocalist mz may be talking about the hellenic economy with the line the vultures will circle till youre down on your knees polish producers pol_ whove released material on freerange in the past dispenses with much of the synth emoting that populate the original instead they drive forwards on a mid paced locomotive rhythm complete with tripped out fx and retro synth pads parisian takes over the flip with he rubs it in rhodes keys and the teensiest of vocal samples although it never quite sparks its left to berlins quell to win the four way battle he drags into a smoky shebeen where he plies it with 90s housey synth stabs mashed out vocals and a grinding locked in rhythm its the best of a solid if unremarkable package of deep euro house

s creative flurry continues apace with this his third ep for in almost as many months you get the impression listening to it that hes a petulant kid; restless full ideas and short on time to get them down in fact feels unmistakably slung and cobbled together as if the aim is to surmise a legendary 12-hour house party in just 5 minutes 39 seconds initially the thing is shapeless with tin pot percussion wooden knocks and slinky hi-hats all scattered about randomly its at once awkward and alluring and only once some warm sweeping synths come in does the whole thing coalesce into a rhythm proper indecipherable vocal snatches add to the bristling unsettled atmosphere is more straight up mining whats best described as a shoddy house vibe for seven minutes of dusty detroit-basement bliss reeds tousled arrangements and knackered sounds come across as thoroughly tossed off intentional or not the results are great
let me guess: you didnt see this one coming things considered its a very clever marketing move ngs annual miami mix cd suddenly feels much more relevant and former dubstep don gains entry to one of the most established institutions in house music oliver was among dubsteps most ruthless and aggressive artists s taste in house and disco meanwhile leans on the flamboyant and the glittery after a brusque twitter announcement that he would only be playing house from now on is s manifesto for his new four to the floor career ts hard to imagine anything sounding more miami in than s selection of new school uk house and crosstown rebels tracks s mix sounds exactly how youd expect it to and its chock full of exclusive tracks like his own electronics remix of finity k problem is that hasnt developed a distinctive style for 4/4 yet and it shows aving between bubbling underground bangers like soph es hing and cheesy 90s house sounds its the kind of mix thatll have you alternately fist pumping and cringing with each drop often than not its pleasant but theres little rhyme or reason to the sequencing strings it together together like a dubstep mix focusing on smaller builds and climaxes rather than a longer arc ngs mix is the complete opposite t takes its time starting with understated vocal tracks like de before climaxing with full on anthems s knockout move manages to include both s ts and epic sunset anthem sticking mainly to poppy house his selections are mixed more leisurely than s with the lovely melodies of or closes instead of glowstick ready rave ups ngs mix is a fine run down of the melodic side of big room house however is still learning his craft which makes this feel like a test run rather than the arrival he wants it to be
i dunno what theyre putting in the water round way but im glad theyre not reading me bedtime stories not that theyre likely to at any stage in the near future but when you get sucked into their brilliantly creepy world of minimal noir youll know what i mean the second installment in their remix series sees stalwart lex and newcomer fiddle with each others bits goes to town on while re jigs which is where we begin things start pleasantly enough with a skipping bassline and playful off beat ping pong percussion but that soon gets swallowed by a terrifying synth black as night 303 farts and an omnipresent unsettling evil pitch drone keeps things rocking with odd drops wonky synth surges and rattlesnake shakers and keeps it interesting with wooden percussion and what sounds like an oboe surely a first lex a man backing away from the new definition of minimal like a trance fan at a pansonic gig counter attacks with a starker unpredictable take on he sets out his stall with whiplash hats and clipped busy percussion which get briefly overpowered by a delightful dash of warm digital fuzz before madcap phreakuencies elbow their way in and take us to the break things get a bit si egg for a mo low end 303 chopped electro beats before everything gets pulled back together in an excellently anti climactic instant two more mini minimal symphonies from the label that (s)cares

john talabots tastes are reflected as much in his wide-ranging dj sets as the roster with his label releasing everything from pionals kaleidoscopic house to mistakes re oks glitchy remixes couple of those appeared on the barcelonians excellent dj kicks mix from 2013 which proved him unafraid to explore dance musics weirder corners nd its there where you imagine he found hiverns latest signing the german duo of benedikt frey and nadia d lo sound like theyve spent plenty of time poking around in those corners themselves unearthing dusty krautrock moth-bitten new beat and dog-eared acid if sounds like any previous hivern release its probably closest to the labels 2013 remix ep for the xx the resemblance is fleeting on a sonic level and comes mainly from the way the male and female vocals intertwine on a track like bout but like the xx frey and d lo seem fascinated by the dance floor more as observers than anything else on for example d los voice is both as entrancing and unsettling as a siren but leads you above and away from the pulsing acid line and rumbling rhythm is the sound of clenched teeth paranoia: the lyrics intone where do you sleep at night and the production plays like sinister echoes of the club thrashing about in your head after youve left the music itself belongs in a similarly liminal state: the noirish is a trip through the colder outskirts of dub techno even when do focus more on the dance floor as with say the electronic riffs feel stretched out and goopy the beats rattling like loose nails nd for all the space in the production which reflects the pairs shared history in sound design tracks like make feel claustrophobic with refrains about choking you to death the title track is an exception building over 15 minutes from an ambient intro to gaseous synths and on into its final maelstrom its lighter in texture but not in tone reveling in the same gloom as the rest of the album within the darkness of s talents burn bright
last years mumdance logos present was a striking compilation of grime-anchored experiments many of the tracks took sharp left turns but the mumdance logos collaborations stood out one was the luminous cafe del mar which in january reemerged on the weightless vol 2 ep on their latest 12-inch the duo take another choice cut and pair it with their first bit of new material since 2015s proto where cafe del mar was about dazzling cinematics is memorable for a different reason: humor the production has all the edgy bits weighty bass weird arrangements laser-cut sound design of mumdance logoss usual work but its most eyebrow-raising feature is a man who blurts out ww come on mate like hes the slow-witted butt of a joke mt takes it up a notch on the other side it flips between sparse and full-throttle focused on a steely single drum with a surprise nosedive into warehouse-ready noise
is not concerned with blowing your mind hes more concerned with doing what he does best; doing what he only knows how the upshot is that his debut album on 2020vision doesnt do bad things to any rule book and nor does it take you places you never knew existed stead it reminds you of places youve been before and of emotions that feel familiar or at least ones that are familiar to baker a dj and producer that has had his head professionally buried in house music for the best part of a decade then is an honest mission but one that reveals itself to be more than just a nostalgic exercise once you hone in on its effervescing eco-system of below-the-surface details itially things seem very simple: mid-tempo house grooves dashes of disco dust here or there and the odd feel good future-retro roller second time through though and a slightly obsessive production finesse reveals itself musical-as-you-like piano melodies barely audible synth tweaks and smatterings of hats claps and hits which act like diacritic markers adding subtle intonation to the main themes of each track thing is out of place sometimes the grooves endlessly re-start and churn up and down sometimes they sulk in a more emotionally vulnerable corner and sometimes they roll out edgelessly into the deep recesses of space but they always hit the mark and avoid loopy ennui when vocals make an appearance (variously from crosstowns glimpse and 2020 newbie debucas) they act as jigsaw pieces rather than hooks which only serve to further humanise an album already alive with rich warm blood manages to reference a whole library of house history past without kowtowing to any of it (or anything more au moment for that matter) in particular more than one effort dabbles in that revered quality of timelessness in fact and helps to mark out an accomplished production advancement from bakers more clinical and reductive dance-floor tracks of yore on cocoon and playhouse the tracks here are more mature more developed and imbued with a sense of loving musicianship which makes the album as a whole more than engaging enough to keep your attention from start to finish
in the early 00s people asked who rex the dog was then they wondered about redshape now the question thats bound to keep being asked long after its answered is this: is arto mwamb really from urkino faso and the answer who knows although since urkino faso literally translates as land of the incorruptible people we can be sure that if arto is from there hes not lying to us regardless of this mystery (or this joke) arto mwamb s music is interesting enough in itself last years mudhutma ep was one of 2007s most distinctive releases with an unorthodox disco energy and deep grooving chords now for the follow up mr mwamb has made one of the goofiest house records youre likely to hear begins with woozy chicago chords and crisp percussion then a mystery vocal drawls along with your friends do that super extra boo boo with your hands hum along with your friends do that super freaky thang with your hands its the kind of hook that guarantees a record will be hated just as much as its loved and suggests could be one of this years poppiest anthems luckily then its actually a fine example of how deep house can be both pop and fun if moodymann had a sense of humour maybe this is the kind of record hed make the rest of the tracks have a difficult act to follow after that d is drafted in for a remix which buries the vocal a little and seems a bit confused stylewise he turns into a justus kohncke-style disco track but its pretty forgettable next to the childish charm of the original for the side arto drops and almost seems to fuse the wet of italian disco with the sweat of us house its an unlikely mix but he just about pulls it off his deep mournful synths are hooky as hell and sound a bit like something lindstrom would do that said long haired scandinavians never made their drums and hats scream house so forcefully the two flavours combined mean this almost ends up more of a song than a track but thats no reason to dismiss it all in all this is another very good ep from arto mwamb it may not quite scale the heights of mudhutma but its still different and shows a producer who does his own thing welcome to ougadougou: techno city
film critic philip french wrote in 990 that nothing dates the past like its impressions of the future he was talking about stanley kubricks 97 film a clockwork orange but at that time he could have been describing for those of us who grew up in the 80s unless we had particularly hip parents already felt like ancient history ce acid house rave and techno had arrived they seemed downright primitive ir funny outfits and rinky-dink sounds all came over like something from a doctor who episode in comparison to the white heat of technical innovation that was happening around us course that was unfair and as we grew into our musical tastes working backwards through underground resistance drexciya and juan atkins s vitality became more obvious not just their influence but also the power and beauty of their creative project as electronic music became more diverse and complex the purity and elegance of their sound gained an added appeal in contrast ir music and art felt more futuristic the further it receded into the past -d catalogue contains recordings of the shows performed in major contemporary art galleries during the bands extended tour of 0 to 0 6 mixing is pristine the performances note perfect the dynamics dramatic and if you select the quadruple blu-ray set (with accompanying deluxe art book with concept work and detail from the shows visuals) and have a decent home viewing setup the package makes absolute sense as a straight-up listening experience whether you get eight cds eight lps or the condensed best of version the value of -d catalogue is a little more questionable for sure the sound is exquisite and the liveness is audible if mostly in filter-sweeps or the way sounds zip across the stereo field res a depth of bass a sense of scale a deftness with those moving sounds that certainly takes you there if youre going to have a deep-listening session whether with hi-fi speakers or headphones but how often honestly are you going to do that for most listening situations what youre getting is buffed and polished remakes of classic quite often the structures seem identical you could send yourself mad flicking back and forth to the original versions working out the slight differences (and believe me i have) certain tracks the majestic sound of the material leaps out here the lushness of the production is transformational and they stand out as worthy additions to the remix and remake canon but too often unless youre 00 immersed in the mixs spatial-dynamic brilliance all that detail is irrelevant and the originals can sound better put the new take on side-by-side with the original and the crisp sparseness of the latter pops out of the speakers more than the live version in a sense its just like any box set if youre a hyper-fan (and god knows have plenty of those) youll want it and will enjoy absorbing every minute if youre not you wont but actually the very nature of makes it more complicated than that way theyve always reassessed and reworked their legacy most notably on 99 s album makes it interesting to see which of their tracks stand up best to new sonic treatments and that their place within the electronic music continuum only seems to become more solidified with each new generation makes new ways of hearing their tracks welcome sometimes impressions of the future dont date they mature

nycs kai ying one half of chris kai gets an opportunity to remix a monster called resurrection kai along with chris have been grabbing major attention for their productions while playing to clubbers worldwide both together and in a solo fashion kai has appeared on john digweeds kiss100 show and was part of the yoshitoshi asia 2004 winter tour as the name suggests kai twists fresh electro melodies over rolling percussion and crisp beats which set the tone for the duration the layering of many melodies at the start help introduce depth while lengthened distorted basslines and the switching between 4x4 beats and breaks add even more dimensions loads of techy goodness here as trickles echos and squelches round every corner but its the constant melody that keeps this track in peak time space a big breakdown features the droning basslines with patches of vocal atmospherics and the nice inclusion of a different bassline kai has done a great job infusing the electro tech and funk elements of this mix and gives the original its due respect excellent stuff

adultnapper and mr c return to their project packing plenty more than clever alliteration with featuring the moody and tastefully restrained feel of adultnappers solo work the track sways with a sinister bump and surgical cleanliness that exposes its sublime juxtaposition of eerie minor-keyed tech funk mr c s devilishly breathy delivery and the shamans positive message of pressing on to have what you want be who you want reboot muffles a bit of the wonky atmosphere found in the original and supplants just about all of mr cs vocal contributions with the straightforward whirring clicks hes known for converting the anthemic original into a useful workmanlike dance floor builder with handclaps thrown in as sweetener ut the real gem on the release is the wighnomy rothers spaced out mutation funked-up and vocodered into a churning floor-filling monster complete with odd horn blasts bowel-shaking bass hits ear-perking pops and an even darker feel with mr cs voice dropped to sinister low registers virulent to the core this release is the perfect winter bomb
s much as i tried to get into after six weeks repeated attempts it just hasn t happened maybe it needs more time: it takes a while to form an impression these daunting three disc alance entries first you listen track by track then disc by disc finally you form an impression as a whole immy van m s alance 0 made the task more manageable by dividing the set into downtempo midtempo uptempo discs but the lines between discs on are tenuous at best but worst all it just never really hits a groove s not because the mixing: desyn masiello 6b demi collectively take a thoughtful approach to their transitions which are seamless elegant for the most part ir selection too can rarely be faulted cutting a wide swath through tracks by edm pioneers phex twin 80s fixtures youngbloods d they most assuredly try to hit a groove time after time: if the crashing thunder rain that kick f disc one are any indication this is supposed to be the most atmospheric disc the three ccentuating this vibe are tracks like the heartbreaking by the beatless mix s the seafeel remix all which drift along blissfully unmoored to a 4 4 beat strange then that they re separated by long periods comprised workmanlike house with the irritating disco s cheesy vocals s ust (despite it being the lindstr m dub) being the worst fenders with that wicked start the aforementioned great tracks this should ve been the chilled out disc you can put on close your eyes to but it s too stilted to take lying down two works significantly better comes out best among the three fans masiello will likely think the same as his trademark re editing genre hopping skills are in top form here (better than on his own alance 0 in fact) mix that kicks f with a special made club ready version s could go anywhere so the trio take the idea run with it switching up prog acid house breaks techno without missing a beat s the only one the three discs with nary a vocal track (unless you count a queen sample on s ) disc two is thoroughly late night heads down fare all the better because that try to capture the same vibe on disc three but it never really takes f fuel s there: highlights being the anthemic prog s martin uttrich s screwy bass heavy take on s like disc one though the sequencing s all wrong: for instance makes for enormously awkward bosom buddies with s yet they re carelessly slapped together mix s longest track s shadow s also happens to be its worst which is never a good thing d like the third lord the rings movie disc three gives a satisfying finish (on astian s fittingly titled ) but then burns through four encores before mercifully fading out bove all other points contention should ve had a clearer sense purpose that doesn t mean had to take the same tack as immy van m did but had they mapped out each disc with rules in place the total package would ve come together much more nicely s such it feels airy aimless; a clean cut case that a great tracklist doesn t make a great mix do a commendable job between tracks but here they ve failed to see the big picture
many pixels have been spilled heralding the achievements of the new breed of detroit producers that have made the jump from the cradle of techno to erlin over the past few years there are plenty that stayed however producers who arent exactly ignorant of their geography but are as equally unencumbered by a history that they had little part in creating or participating in simply because of their age is one of them a producer responsible for a slate of tracks that owe little to geography unless the internet counts as a country these days was the final salvo in a remarkably busy 2009 for wadsworth one that saw him offering up a few stunners namely mainline along the way isnt quite the gem that mainline was but it isnt intended to be opting instead for clean entry into tech-y deep house sets that feature plenty of melody few gimmicks are employed there are no blasting horns ala his hear me know 12-inch on fresh meat its simply solid dance floor fodder with enough distinction to stand slightly above the rest of the genre relegated to the -side wadsworth is preceded on this piece of vinyl by david lvarados remix of which takes things in a slightly darker direction the veteran producers remix elicits tension out of the wordless male voice and then pushes a synth into the mix that ratchets things up even further two very different tracks for two very different times of the night
2003 was a very good year for as they continued to release quality house cuts they look to continue the form into and to do this they have called on to liven things up with the release comes with two remixes from cabasa and the original on the a-side is cabasa s air guitar remix the track builds nicely early on with smooth drums alongside a nice thick baseline that rumbles along seamlessly and keeps the track progressing nicely a looped guitar riff works its way into the loop and it seems to work quite well with the vocal overall it s quite a funky house track with a little dirty and tough edge thanks to the guitar riffs firstly on the b-side is cabasa s wanting dub disappointingly it s almost an exact replicate of the vocal mix on the a-side with not many additions seeing any changes the guitar loop remains as does the baseline but all in all it is a vocal stripped version of the original mix the original mix follows this and one thing that is noticeable is how much the vocal stands out more then it does in the cabasa mixes the drums are a little tighter on the whole and the track not as percussion based as the remixes i must say though that the baseline works quite smoothly in this mix and to be honest the original is probably the most impressive of the lot not a bad release by play and it seems that is scheduled to be just as good as last year was
matt cutlers music is a dense mosaic of styles backpacker hip hop style idm old rave music courses through his work though his tracks coated in radiant colours textures are instantly recognisable as his own cutlers kicks mix is a revealing look into how those sounds come together charting his musical upbringing evolution the mix is not so much a set as a musical autobiography a treat for fans captivating enough to please casual listeners as well with ravey albums like levitate the recent house oriented ambivert tools series its easy to overlook cutlers hip hop roots a highlight from his 2008 debut album lemurian features here alongside a swath of other contemporary examples you can hear the blueprint for s sound with hudson mohawke mike slotts (as ) res vintage indie rap from def juxs the madlib associated while a cut from 1998 splits the difference between cutlers hip hop his psychedelic electronica cutler mixes these hip hop tracks in a leisurely way as you might with a few friends in your living room after a party even when he gets into techno the approach stays the same: adventurous but not flashy cruising through tracks old (john beltrans ) new (e s ntitled ) as well as a few of his own cuts second half of the mix reflects the sound of cutlers magicwire label somewhere between chunky lo fi house gleaming renderings of his own work s (hippy) a laidback dreamy house tune melts into the rougher bumpier contours of a spectrum of sounds textures we dont usually hear from mix ends on an odd pivot into n electro lush idm from from a b cutler has remixed in the past its a dreamy finish to a mix that stays low key all the way through even the track though jarring at first feels restrained in the context of the mix cutlers ambling pace retro outlook calls to mind seth troxlers kicks but where that was basically a run through classic house records cutlers is more of a private diary entry nlike his productions its not a seamless weave of trends genres ideas instead kicks lays out each of his influences piece by piece almost like listening to a deconstructed album for fans of cutlers singular music its an essential entry in his discography
whatever your opinion of theres no doubting that deep down orlando higginbottom is a music geek thats what made his first major label album trouble so disappointing where were the sharp edges the idiosyncrasies which had made his early eps so interesting stead trouble sounded like a bid for pop stardom one which perhaps happily in the long term didnt quite pan out on we find teed reasserting his credentials as an electronic maverick with a singular approach though never quite bursts into life (it wanders too much detouring into the saccharine house of lex s kilnsman or s ) it is nonetheless a refreshingly eclectic set where youll find for instance the pitched down vocals of s melting into s post punk styled f that reflects a certain leftfield indie dance aesthetic on higginbottoms part the beginning and end of show a different side of his sound: all rattling percussion slivers of melody and organic / electronic interplay these passages are more in the vein of nico jaar itially cd ups the hit rate mixing is flatly functional but the way it bursts out of the blocks flipping between kosmische urs obscure lpha and ts trus mes take on sheffield bleep techno is several kinds of marvellous set eventually loses this giddy variety but not before higginbottom chucks us a works in s ridiculous and drops s recreation of classic northern british late 80s piano house to like cid paulis contribution to the series isnt stunning but it is the kind of playful unpredictable mix that the world needs more of

as expected james holden s label has come out with 2 great releases so far and if you expect things to die down after the honeymoon period of the label then you might be quite surprised is up next with a track which definitely made a difference opening up james holden s balance mix apart from the original and the mfa fungle mix the release also comes with a remix from in form swedish young man petter the original mix gets the ball rolling with its beautiful and smooth baseline opening the track as well as some melodic filtered effects and rattling hi hats smooth atmospheric elements make themselves heard leading into the breakdown where the quirky vocal line enters the track maintains a smooth flow throughout and is somewhat a smooth and deep yet epic production s fungle mix follows on the a-side and it showcases the diverse nature of the mfa turning the production into a devastating drum and bass track the baseline is somewhat evil while the vocal line gets a remaking as does the quirky melodic structures of the original mix interesting to say the least and a healthy addition to this release on the flip is petter s different version and the title doesn t lie as this is quite a unique production by petter it is a quality journey into tech house bleeps and twisted effects as well as delicate melodies in the breakdown particularly however midway through the track intensifies with an acid baseline and an increase in the drums while the synths also subtly rage in the breakdown another fantastic release from with three totally different tracks in this release creating amazing diversity on one slab of vinyl not only are they diverse but more importantly they all are very good in their own way
though his 2010 ep the only way up played an early role in shaping the sound is the labels odd man out he lives in toronto (not london) his music is less angular than most stuff by bok bok or jam city and hes not as prolific as his peers s l is arguably the most distinctive of the lot releasing music thats more psychedelic than it is dancey especially his 2011 album bible after a period of relative quiet david psutka returns with a restless record that finds itself on the same archaeological dig through grime aesthetics that the rest of have been undertaking lately the artifacts he finds however are wholly unfamiliar is a collection of compact suites that rise and fall with the splendour of a film score axis [intro] and the title track spend the lps first five minutes biding their time before fading out with a single puff the distant sirens of preface the harrowing which lets out wide arcs of synth and brutally attacks them with needlepoint percussion the gasps of die out to make way for the techno-inspired which runs into the dejected limp of and so on takes full liberty of the album formats room for experimentation it reduces itself to silence with every descent so that any momentum quickly dissipates it shares an attention-deficit fragmentation with jam citys classical curves but where that one rushed headlong into each fascinating new experiment this one takes deep breaths and measured steps its a record more about sound design and structure an abstract deconstruction of sleek chrome aesthetic
ross tones refusal to confine himself to a sound is refreshing if not always successful as throwing snow hes fashioned moody melodic beat music and as snow ghosts in collaboration with augustus ghost he released an xx-channelling album for houndstooth that somehow got labelled as folk-metal his latest alias tries to marry that variety to something more floor-focused but fails to hit its mark each track plays rhythmic games as if to highlight the nonsense of delineating genres when the same melodies fit into be considered techno hip-hop or drum bass depending on what surrounds them its a clever trick but little more take and which use percussive shifts to change the perception of a bassline the formers sub is a growl that accelerates and slows either through snapping 140 bpm or a half-time thud unfortunately both versions are pretty limp the latter plays the ol switcheroo its throbbing bassline not quite gelling with the triple-time drums before tones whisks back the curtain to reveal that it was darkstep d b all along but again neither iteration quite works its the same game on although here the change from anaemic techno to bouncy footwork leaves you wishing that tones just made the good bit longer unfortunately ziros remix isnt that edit but a largely forgettable slab of warehouse techno which leaves the least complete yet arguably most interesting track a brief motif of interlocking cellos and heartbeat timpani but as with the rest of the ep youre left ruing what could have been
on s 70th outing we find two of germanys hottest producers gabriel nanda and dominik eulberg teaming up for the first time that it is the maiden voyage is sometimes noticeable as both struggle to fully leave behind their signature sounds and combine their talents successfully is if anything well named as this cut is certainly one with a rolling feel to it starting off with a bouncy rhythm eulbergs glitches and bleeps find themselves centre stage before nanda soon joins the party bringing one of his trademark melodies with him it comes in a wave slowly enveloping all other elements of the track before the kick restores balance similar buildup then follows but this time when the kick arrives it is not quite as substantial as you may have expected with the mellow rhythms that dominate most of the track quickly reasserting themselves from there it just keeps on rolling and when it comes to an end nine minutes later you are left feeling gratified but not totally fulfilled the track having never fully developed the way it perhaps should have nevertheless the cut does retain a certain charm to it and definitely could work its way into dj sets but perhaps not during peaktime is the stronger side as the two producers do a better job of working together deep bassline starts the track off nicely instantly giving it a more up tempo feel than distorted melody begins by lurking in the background and slowly emerges to the fore finally kicking well and giving this cut a rocking edge nanda and eulberg proceed to a breakdown introducing some well placed chimes before revisiting the melody and kicking the track in a much more resolute fashion from here on the bassline really comes to dominate as it transits into a tougher number rather than coming to an end though things continue along and start sounding more like a jam session as the direction changes again the track finally finishes around the ten minute mark with a rather surprisingly misplaced vocoder oth cuts on this 12 are solid and show plenty of potential but neither hit the mark fully on the -side nanda and eulberg struggle to create a unified sound while on the flip there is perhaps a bit too much going on so while unfortunately the release doesnt quite live up to the sum of their two considerable talents there is still probably enough on this 12 to merit a look and to keep an eye out for future releases from this impressive pairing
even now theres a sense in which a singles ideal is that the and sides will have something to say to one another split singles tend to be predicated along those lines from an old sub pop goodie like having mudhoney and jimmie dale gilmore cover one another in 1994 or rush s brilliant 2010 match up of faltydl and cosmin trg putting out s with s on the flip is in that sense as canny as anything has issued in the last few years which is to say very canny indeed take the labels away and theres little chance youd guess the two tracks werent by the same artist or in a pinch werent a single track in two separate mixes is music for bringing a set up or down a notch not for rushing your bollocks off s track is tech house that uses its spangles sparely the springy central riff offsetting the strutting bass has a dreamier tune the brief piano flourish could be an etude for closing credits the warm voice like central riff ( eee eee eeeeee ooooh ) fit for a sauna or it would be if the track didnt have a harder pulse than the side oth tunes aim to nudge the room temperature not alter it entirely
recent discography of the new york scene reads a lot like a family tree with for all its success a surprisingly small gene pool labels beget bands; bands beget duos; duos beget solo projects with plenty of cuckolded bedfellows and illegitimate offspring for good measure somewhere near the centre of all this is an outstretched : out hud and t d are generations past and present adeptly executed re-edits and mixes the bastard children ut for all the collaboration and trimmings vandervolgen had yet to fly the nest solo ensuring anticipation for his first artist ep the 10th in golf channels aloof but impressive history was suitably feverish confounding any expectations of label homogeneity or indeed of his own apparent disco-rock sympathies shows an admirable level of not giving a shit by getting his hands dirty with trance (think perry rhodan not paul van dyk) here far from being an experiment in irony though is distinctly unpretentious and aims squarely at the corporal rather than mental effects of hypnotism trippy synths metronomic hats and inevitably lots of clapping are lambasted together in a track that deliberately goes nowhere but round in circles i havent heard it in a club yet and im sure half the intended purpose is lost on me here at home but its easy to let your imagination take you there on the flip side sheeboyah opens with more of a familiar swing and is generally less breakneck all round but as the onomatopoeia of the title suggests its no less forthright in function this time however the pocket-watch in pendulum takes the shape of swelling pads and arpeggios while a two-note bass line summons eyes to gaze into as the body takes control in and around this hazy oblivion has created a record destined for a specific time and place im yet to find either but i shall look forward to when i do
sometimes a mix comes along that catches you by surprise usually you know what compilations are coming out and you know when they will be in stores this mix by called crept up on me and grabbed me straight away resident at fabric in london you may know as one of the co-authors of a book called last night a dj saved my life an accomplished author and journalist this cd showcases the musical side of bill as a dj and shows why he is such a respected figure in the uk dance scene the uptown mix (cd1) is a deep array of house with a percussive touch there are many beautiful moments to be had with this disc the beautifully crafted baselines of mateo and matos mix of brazilia city mix by teddy g is one such moments and perhaps one of the finest moments on the cd is early on in this mix that of kote moun yo by dj hiro feat masabumi kikuchi beautiful percussion patterns chirping melodies and soothing strings make this a classic record the quirky seoul by max fresh is another finer musical excursion while solaris height relive the disco era with midnight the mix ends in a percussive rhapsody with mandinga drumz by don yvo meets the hunter with a clever accapella used over the top the downtown mix (cd2) is what the name suggest a more downtempo affair of chilled grooves and softer beats tasty treats by chantilly sounds like something out of a porn film in a good way while people s choice continue the 70 s theme with do it any way you wanna truant s mix of rae christian s vai viver a vida is a calming and chilled ethnic vocal affair while the trademark baseline of chicken lips grabs a stranglehold late in the mix with their delightful wind ya neck in the mix concludes with futuro by nova scotia feat nina miranda another foreign vocal record with soothing drums and a summer aura the only difficult or stressful thing with this mix is reading the tracklisting as the mix itself is perfect for lying back in the sun and sinking a few lagers although the style of music may not appeal to all there is enough variety to maintain interest and the ease of listening to both mixes played a vital part in my enjoyment of this release check it out at your record store there might be enough in it to appeal for further listening cd1 - uptown 1 catalpa - beanfield 2 fire - wagon cookin 3 brazilia city mix - teddy g (mateo and matos deep mix) 4 kote moun yo - dj hiro feat masabumi kikuchi (joe claussell rhythmental mix) 5 the fires inside - chris lum 6 hazy shade of love - alexander east (deep sugar mix) 7 mushrooms - marshall jefferson vs noosa heads (salt city orchestra out there mix) 8 seoul - max fresh 9 infinite rhythm - afro-mystic (dub mix) 10 touch the sun - atjazz 11 flatbush dawn - be bop dawg (catalyst bossa mix) 12 midnight - solaris heights (original mix) 13 mandinga drumz / f l love capsule deluxe - don yvo meets the hunter (acappella) cd2 - downtown 1 psychedelic billy - leo young presents the subiaco project (laj remix) 2 strobelight serenade - superstars of rock (original mix) 3 tasty treats - chantilly 4 conga sunrise - all good funk alliance 5 don t mind if i do - bushy 6 bones - brandi ifgray 7 do it any way you wanna - people s choice (album version) 8 latin stroll - universal principles (original mix) 9 honey - tosca (only child dub) 10 vai viver a vida - rae christian featuring tania maria (truant little witch pass mix) 11 praise dance - take aim 12 wind ya neck in - chicken lips 13 i got it (pts 1 2) - new york port authority 14 junta jaeger - rune lindbaek 15 futuro - nova scotia feat nina miranda
makes sense that dj sprinkles (terre thaemlitz) and snds mark fell would work together oth artists have invested much of their work in theory and conceptual elaboration certainly more so than most club music producers and beyond that both have a similar knack for turning out unusually even unnaturally pristine sounds think of the enforced sterility of snds funk in a vacuum or the hyper-defined hi-hats of sprinkles midtown 120 lues so crisp they sound like clipping artifacts theyre not so much minimalists as fetishists sculpting each sound until its as hard and as brilliant as an industrially produced diamond here they apply themselves to pumping two-chord house so classic that you might mistake it for generic ut that sense of over-familiarity is part of the bait-and-switch (n u m twists up the old preacher-vocals trope utilizing an impassioned anti-capitalist speech from arthur scargill head of ritains socialist labour party and the president of the national union of mineworkers during their historic strike in 1984-85 doesnt beat you over the head though: like the voiceovers on sprinkles 2009 lp midtown 120 lues scargills voice is mixed low compelling you to lean in and listen closer s politics as seduction in place of scargills speech the hee-haw remix employs part-comic part-creepy wails suggesting the diva as a kind of scary clown figure but without taking anything away from the serious pleasure of their crisply stepping organ groove takes up the entire -side with 12-and-a-half minutes of trim machine drumming and fluid synthesizers threaded by an almost subliminal hint of vocals again its a resolutely classic affair evoking the luminous deep house of the late 90s and early 00s; im reminded of luomos vocalcity though theres a crispness and even a bluntness here that stands apart from luomos gauzy productions whatever references you bring to it its a mesmerizing enveloping excursion into the mechanics of form at its most sensual
the appearance of a album on is solid confirmation that the world has finally caught up with these long unheralded visionaries label founder and vocal supporter brad rose would certainly testify the swedish outfit just might be the original progenitors of technoise and lo-fi house (as well as any other phrase denoting the recent eruption of noise and drone musicians experimenting with techno and house forms) talk about prescient: it was all the way back in the late 80s when came up with the idea of tossing acid house residents-flavored obscurantism industrial and diy tape culture into a blender the sound that poured forth was gritty unremittingly eccentric and packed with a hardware-generated crunch it was in other words electronic dance music for total freaker-punks coughing up too many cassettes and 12-inches to count (the majority via group co-founder jan svenssons b rft records) have remained doggedly committed to their original vision through the years that said theyre not lacking in evolutionary refinement deed possesses the kind of seasoned craftsmanship indicative of veteran musicians (i e they know exactly what they want and how to achieve it) a result this means the record isnt nearly as anarchic as say hard friends or old traka-traka party standout titles dating back to the mid-90s whats more the record exudes an appreciation of stylistic breadth that reflects years of deep-focus exploration this sense are sort of like a cunning old magician with a vast arsenal of tricks any one of which he can call up with a snap of his fingers because of these qualities makes for a suitable sampler platter whether youre a would-be initiate or just casually curious both the opener no 1 and are amorphously scratchy and squiggly representing as they do s avant-garde tendencies (think the keith fullerton whitman zone) built from dubby zaps and ping-ponging babble ig ng is in a similar boat but with a melodic bounce reminiscent of neue deutsche welle oddballs pyrolator and der plan shifting focus to actual beats and grooves is a slice of fairly orthodox minimal wave (new -like arpeggiations crisply hissing hi-hats robo-vox) proving arent necessarily allergic to club culture additional proof is the splendid to replete with gooey ebm darkness and hand-clap triplets though both of these tracks are noticeably low-tech and grainy a dj could easily slip them into a set full of italians do it better jams and indie-electro without fear of stink eye from the dance floor the same could also be said of but then again maybe not considering its awfully dirty and unhinged smartly closes with its best production: stumbling bass cardboard toms chintzy snares muffled gurgles a hypnotically lopsided gait this is s textbook sound it one can hear plainly the considerable influence theyve exerted on technoise (in particular ren schofields container project) but whats really interesting is its minimal structure and just how archetypal it is despite the fact that these swedes have spent the last four decades operating outside of techno so to speak theyre not that far removed from omar-s in their uncanny ability to tap the raw nature unique to the musics earliest and (some would say) purest manifestations
its safe to say that a kind of mythic consciousness pervades gavin russoms artistic practice track list of his last project lack meteoric star allegorized a long night out in mythic form a night that began with the club entrance as death tunnel survived a world eater and ended at dawn nd while its all-analogue tingle and squelch marked a direct line to chicago acid ms didnt simply feel like acid house itself but a kind of kabbalistic rereading of acid as a tradition where all of the elements that made it a tradition were replayed with their ritualistic aspects cranked up russoms latest release welds the mythic to the urban in a similar manner: working as whose first of three projected singles is titled sees russom applying lessons gleaned from his earlier explorations of acid and 70s synth-psychedelia towards something more boldly original and forward-thinking a rolling psychedelic banger that transfigures its influences into something invigoratingly new sees russoms interest in ritual extended to ethnographic appropriation here specifically the musical languages of razil where a recent visit inspired him to incorporate the energies of carioca funk atabaque drumming tropicalia and south merican style rave into his creative practice whats more russom specifically lists phantasias early 90s elgian acid 12-inches inner light and violet skies as influences and its not a difficult lineage to detect as brims with a similarly devilish intensity and cosmic expanse when viva ruizs spanish vocals and russoms prickly synths ultimately wrestle for supremacy it becomes a clever timely update of early vocal acid track moves from stripped-down acid through weirdo disco to vocal house with the steady hushed concentration of a peyote ritual tension builds along a broad and careful trajectory gathering all sorts of energy like a tesla coil leaving you with hairs prickled on your neck waiting for lightning to strike n opening techno groove creeps with swooping filters to the four minute mark where ruizs vocals and some exotic percussion bonk portend whats to come once they enter the scene you realize youve left safe confines behind n additional male vocal open the door dont you want some more ups the sense of rthur-russell style unpredictability i mean yes theres an instrumental version you can use but then youre missing a lot of what makes such a standout especially when it barrels into a final fist-pumping chant where vocals and acid squelch churn at full throttle somewhere on an open plain miles from where you started
micah and nicholas bennison join forces for this next release on and they release two pretty driving productions that have already seen support from marco v john 00 fleming in particular slidestream is pretty driving from the word go with a deep baseline that rides under tribal based percussion and subtle synths and minimal melodic tones pretty intense throughout apart from the breakdown the track never really lets up from the word go an intense peak timer the pace picks up on the flip with drivetrain mechanics as a deep driving baseline gives the track its spine in the same vein as the a-side the track really is relentless never really stopping for air except in the short breakdown midway a point where some subtle melodic twists come into the track not that bad a release with two tracks that are definitely on the trancier side of things

gavin keitel s freshman entry for eq s electric mix series was the best unsung comp of 2005: simple yet stunning carefully compiled and thoughtfully mixed but the whimper it made didn t bode well for the electric series even continuing let alone reaching double digits after a trip back to the drawing board and over a year later retools the series with nifty new cover art and an extra disc; this time with mixes from london duo king unique and melbourne trio nubreed just as mr keitel shed his prog house roots in favour of minimal techno and tech house nuggets king unique leave sleazy house at the door and slip into some cozy electrohouse while nubreed give their introspective breaks a noisy electrohouse beatdown it s not a total transformation though king unique s taste for big bass is evident by the first track modeselektor s ziq zaq : with its sigur r s-esque synths it s nice n gauzy but it s sure to test your subwoofer s low-end capabilities claude vonstroke s who s afraid of detroit arrives next and booka shade also pop up with not one but two tracks night falls and in white rooms ; both were highlights of their stellar movements album so for anyone like me who wore that album thin on steady rotation this summer and heard detroit about 900 times this year king unique s disc has a few skip-button moments luckily however there are some real gems francois dubois (aka funk d void) serves up the mellow i try a track heavy on the uplifting piano and breathy male vocals harkening back to house s mid-90s golden era elsewhere king unique s dub of the titular line from felix da housecat s rocket ride over kupon s zoom in is a subtle way to make an epic techno track even better from there the mix stumbles through a been-there-heard-that selection from a who s-who of german producers: booka shade sascha funke and thomas schumacher andrea dorian s twisted eerie quantised traffic feels out of place here like the matts decided listeners must be getting bored by now and so decided to throw everybody off the mix ties together nicely at the end though with phobos by stephan bodzin vs mark romboy coming full-circle with its massive bassline and a cinematic sense of urgency compared to their y4k comp from back in january nubreed s disc is uh an entirely new breed the boys are as glitch-happy as ever but gone are the mopey broken beats hello bass-thumping four-to-the-floor electrohouse sadly it takes a while to really hit the right groove as the first four tracks are merely mediocre at best milton jackson s tech no is the worst culprit: a relentlessly lame rhythm + annoying synth stabs five-and-a-half minute headache mercifully the mix finally kicks into gear when danny bonnici dan mangan unleash their trademark melbourne sound with periwethel the track is hard to pin down incorporating elements from breaks tech house and prog house but the end product is assuredly antipodean: hard-hitting with just a twinge of melancholy periwethel then segues quite nicely into nubreed s own subtronic a return to form for the boys as they layer a major nu-skool knobjob over a bodypopping old-skool breakbeat from there we get a double dose of d ramirez remixes future funk squad s audio damage and plump djs classic electric disco the plumps remix really shines a goofy good time with a helluva build-up and breakdown that s sure to drop bombs on any dancefloor nubreed then let their freak flag fly with two exceptionally quirky tracks alex kenji s cyborg and speculam s backdoor while there s a 4/4 rhythm somewhere in backdoor it also has a really nifty broken beat which sounds like either a) the floor creaking in a haunted house or b) an old boat rocking in the tide either way it s a totally unique track and could perk some important ears for this fresh producer nubreed s finish takes the club-happy route as hook n sling remix aussie songstress sarah mcleod s he doesn t love you with her pack-a-day voice perfectly complementing the squelchy production is some solid bang for your buck though fans of the king unique disc may not warm to nubreed s and vice versa ku looks at electrohouse and offer a stripped-down interpretation; nubreed opt for throwing pixilated paint all over it while ku s track selection is often uninspired the mix does genuinely feel lovingly handcrafted as the cover pretentiously declares; and while nubreed start off like a trio of monkeys at the decks when the mix finally melds electrohouse and breaks it does feel like they know what they re doing both discs of are flawed but redeemable and both dj teams get props for shifting gears even if they end up with mixed results eq s electric series is shaping up to be something of a challenge for djs to play something different and who knows the roster could end up more interesting than their hallowed balance lineup
djs beni g and go make up the mixologists - a highly skilled turntablist duo from the uk and have a few titles to their name - the most recent being the winners of the uk 2001 dmc team battle and runners up in the world final of the same year representing for dmcs the mixologists have cooked up a tasty mix consisting of a healthy selection of hip hop urban grooves and moving into drumnbass to demonstrate their arsenal the mixologists cut and scratch on top of a plus one beat before moving into da rockwilder by one of hip hops favourite tag teams method man and redman ms dynamite represents for the urban crowd on put him out laying down a ragga flow un-cuts skin 2 skin has a definite neptunes influence to the production especially with the heavy use of percussion and funky bass arrest the president by raw dog has a nice uk hip hop feel to it - heavily syncopated beats almost on a 2-step vibe and techy bass - and features the vocal stylings of taskforce and braintax on a political tip - giving up the righteous middle finger to the dubya lifted from the brilliant original pirate material is same old thing by the streets mixed in perfectly with loose lips hitting the snare drum beats on syncopation - tight production and rhymes make you wonder why commercial radio seems to force garbage down your throat than get the real urban music into you spit features beatboxing by the uks best beatboxer killa kela the mc vocals of mc trip and the scratching talents of the mixologists - the posse being known collectively as spitkingdom and spit is on one a real jump hands in the air tip while interestingly enough keeping things minimal before the tempo double times to 160+ bpms mixologists move the mix into reggae with murderer an exclusive tune by skitz alongside deadly hunta and they cross the atlantic for sean paul on infiltrate - if you can stand the latters rantings on the r b tunes hes appeared on then infiltrate will please personally to kick off the drumnbass section is dj hype on the old skool jungle flavoured coming in good - ragga vocal samples and an old skool jungle bass line bringing it back to 94 dj skitz and mcs dynamite and gq represented for the hip hop and drumnbass fraternities with we make them make noise on plus ones previous effort this time around dj clipz transforms it into a drumnbass tune for the jungle heads right before adam f and m o p command you all to stand clear before ending off the mix overall a decent mix of hip hop urban reggae and drumnbass tunes hardly any weak tracks on this one however what gets me is that plus one was able to pull off a double cd volume whereas the mixologists were only able to come up with one perhaps plus one just exhausted all the uk hip hop tracks leaving the mixologists with none to use rumour has it that the mixologists are planning to visit aussie shores in the coming months so it would be nice to see their scratching skills done live
ten described as brian enos prot g or coldplays producer for the first part of his career is now a big name on his own thats largely thanks to his excellent 20 3 album mmunity which earned the london producer a rcury prize nomination and the attendant broadsheet column inches hes also pulled in fans his live show ascending festival bills to take the sort of slots once held by the likes of groove rmada or cinematic orchestra exactly the sort of people who mix in other words rather than underground artists trying to impress you their white labels are carefully curated collections from established artists who the exception of matt helders of rctic monkeys deliver exactly the kind of thing their records would lead you to expect is a classically trained electronic producer a sideline in film soundtracks whos done remixes and production work for and so naturally his includes tracks from and twilit ambient and neo classical from and glitchy beats from and the odd homespun folk number from overall quality of these selections is on par own productions res a sense of his classical training in the way he even makes moments of near silence such as and s n sound symphonic first two albums 200 s opalescent and 2004s contact note had an inkling of what he would blossom into 2008s nsides but not enough to set them apart from other chill out stuff at the time like those records lacks the avant garde quality of nsides and mmunity not to mention the records plays on his bbc radio show but if youre after something to curl up in the small hours this will do just fine
is a full-length collaboration by queens-based producer madteo (aka matteo ruzzon) and brooklyn weirdo-rap veteran sensational both artists wander the outskirts of their chosen genres: ruzzons been plying an outsider version of house long before it became fashionable to do so and sensationals been freestyling madcap rhymes over experimental beats since the early 90s makes it clear that both of them draw primarily from the streets for inspiration not in the typical hip-hop sense but from the bodegas the neighborhood characters and dog-eared 12-inches of new yorks past sensational is best known for his work within new yorks 90s illbient and experimental hip-hop scenes and has more recently been associated with artists championed by bill kouligass pan label most of his solo releases have come through spectres wordsound recordings and he also worked with nhkkoyxe on a 2010 lp s unclear how ruzzon and sensational linked up but their work together spans back to madteos debut single basiado beatdown indeed their opaque approaches go hand-in-hand in an interview with the wire s derek walmsley sensational described his music as full of the fog shit i be in and about which could work as a description of madteos music as well released on dj sotofetts label is a stylistic grabbag thatll make you feel like youre surfing the fm dial in some alternate reality madteo moves through narcotic dub ( 0 99 intro ) and corroded boom-bap ( ) while sensational throws out improvised-sounding wordplay thats dense but direct the highlights are a couple of tunes solely credited to madteo which features effects from sotofett and guitar from neo-dub classicist tapes is a meandering psych-rock track that sounds like a synth obscurity from d sseldorf or xico is another serpentine piece of psychedelia this time embedded with disco loops sees ruzzon and sensational at the height of their collective powers offering up their abstract version of a golden-era rap jam as sensational shouts play them keys ruzzon brings in a clanging set of rhodes chords making clear the vital chemistry between these two margin walkers
you can rely on to add something interesting to the uk dance conversation whether with s breakbeat wig out blnk003 s hyper syncopated goron sound or timely interventions from overseas artists ( dj clent audioboyz ) this various artists ep doesnt capture the labels full stylistic breadth and doesnt equal its best moments but its a solid primer to an often overlooked pocket of uk activity opening and closing tracks explore restrained eerie moods aka label founder sam purcell loops smeared piano samples on the brief while newcomer offers the stern bass techno trudge of in between two tracks take existing styles and complexify them duo s target is post dubstep bass music y keep the glowering moods and hollow bass concussions and add intricate layers of percussion that skitter across the beat metrist under his l sae alias applies a similar rhythmic sense to new school industrial techno meaning tougher drums and squalls of distortion neither track has a big payoff but their clever winding arrangements grip your attention and dont let go
with its latest release russian label is fast proving a distinctive voice just like the previous two 3 comes from a previously unknown artist and takes a flexible dreamy approach to house the lead synths in feel utterly relaxed ambling contentedly through vapourous clouds of melody lightweight percussion tocking away in the tracks bottom registers its an illusion of course but there doesnt seem to be any repetition here takes a similarly freeform approach along with flitting synths thickly-plucked arps are made to swim in and out of focus filters gently coaxing them along the records piece de resistance is undoubtedly if the earlier allusions to dreaminess werent enough then this 11:35 journey surely will be it seems like the perfect way to open a set: five minutes of enveloping biosphere-like ambient before nimble kicks slip in underneath and the track turns into an atmospheric club cut skips the beats altogether sounding a little bit boards of canada in the process: childlike and nostalgic only loosely linked its dusty chords and pure-sounding bells almost sound like music to ride carousels to like everything else on 3 it shows an unusually fluid approach to composition each portion seguing to its neighbours as carefully as day fades to night

if deep hazy house is your thing keep an eye on a new name from an unlikely place tennessee has linked up with the danish label nord records for his debut release the result is a four-tracker of wonderfully warm and nuanced analog jams s heart-shaped synths blissful yet bittersweet linger in space as dense layers of filtered percussion cut smartly through the mix the title track is a little slower and more subdued an introspective journey filled with soft drones airy bits of melody and some trippy (but never over-the-top) effects on the flip features a mellow melody that meanders in and out of focus while with its soaring synths and heaving drums makes for an anthemic end to the record is my pick of the four but theres not a dull moment here nord has already put out fine efforts from two well-regarded american producers in dj spider and bookworms and this time the labels look to the states has uncovered a promising new talent
in 1975 brian eno and peter schmidt published a deck of cards designed to help artists untangle creative knots each one contained advice such as listen to the quiet voice simple subtraction be dirty sk your body these oblique strategies encouraged self-examination and perhaps never grow old the floorplan hit of 2013 did the same for on paradygm shift vol 2 hood fights the rhythms of his own making which had been sliding away from the minimalism hes known for the compelling motor: nighttime world 3 album was evidence of that move an electronic opera next to the spartan threads of minimal nation one quality that paradygm shift vol 2 shares with its predecessor other than a back-to-basics approach is a gravitational density the songs seem compressed by an unseen weight enhancing an intensity that hood manipulates with subtle rhythmic tricks and tone modulations on the mutations of a single note demonstrate hoods ease with repetition it ascends on the same gentle gradient as forms and lockers before it but if is any measure the paradygm shift series has room for tracks that rush in the opposite direction is an avalanche a volcanic eruption a meteorite an awe-inspiring force of nature but it couldve been improved with one of enos strategies the camera shutter claps rattle unnecessarily like hood might be in the process of re-learning that less is more
youd be hard-pressed to find a city more obsessed with coffee than melbourne its therefore no mystery why johan elgstrom a swedish exp and resident of eight years decided to call his new label short black its debut record comes from a local dj who made the ep last year as part of his finals university he also documented the process with a blog the blog is a ne look into the music-making process something th is often inscrutable for listeners we learn for instance th the drums in come from an old breaks record and th its juno bassline doesnt sound the same as the old larry heard tracks kennedy was trying to emul e ( but th s ok i dont think id want it to be identical ) nevertheless the pad-filled is a decent replic ion of heards trademark warm vibes the remaining three tracks also lean heavily on samples but do so in good taste the funky swagger of isnt too far removed from a typical andr s cut especially when the bre hy vocals enter and at feel more modern altern ely channelling pure zen vibes and quasi-tribal bliss even if they both contain be s karl oconnor recently said his first project was completely and primarily me trying to copy my heroes and clearly theres a bit of th going on with kennedy but his tracks dont sound like mere rip-offs suggesting he may have bigger more original things ahead of him
october has long seemed like a satellite member of new york and new jerseys deep and dark house sound a connection confirmed by last years gradiva ep for fred ps soul people music as such its nice to see the favour repaid with an ep from new jersey visionary on tanstaafl the label launched by october and john osborn in what has been an exceptionally prolific two years for anderson this ep for a sublabel run by osborn alone is essentially more of the same its more forthright than this years after forever lp and not quite as weird as some of his best tracks still theres plenty here in which to get absorbed the title track is the hardest of the three keep expecting its gloopy bassline to do more than churn grimly away; instead all we get is the odd fog of dissonance and later a barrage of claps seemingly intended to lacerate eardrums into submission cant bring is lighter hinging on one of those anderson-trademark synth lines that bobs and weaves around a hook without ever quite landing a blow on it anderson has never been one for easy pleasures and the tracks cascades of chords are way too unstable to be called soulful in fact as the thing wears on they start to seem pretty discomfiting finally on we achieve lift-off over a slow-chugging groove its pretty chords and lilting rhodes offer glimmers of cosmic release only glimmers mind but in andersons universe thats all we need
ts safe to say that max graef has a fairly impeccable collection of funk jazz and soul this we know not just from the young berliners dj sets but from the chunks of it he sampled for early singles on his label box aus holz as well as 2014s rivers of the red planet album on tartelet but for his first album on money ex a label he runs with fellow crate-digging obsessives glenn astro and delfonic graef wrote a record not just based on the sounds of old records but also made in the same way finds the house producer putting away computers picking up his bass guitar and gathering friends to jam out some live jazz-funk the thought of jazz-funk and jamming may have some scurrying away faster than a thumb can thwack out a slap-bass solo but this album swings with every track squeezed into a few minutes and performed by a stellar band theres a real intuition between the players as heard on the title track when they settle into a strutting groove following graefs cocksure bass kickflip mikes drumming is pretty unfussy for music of this ilk and his solid 4/4 kicks could slot and into graefs adventurous house sets moments like cg with its head-nodding keys nimble bass and slippery guitar solo provided by graefs jazz musician father gerry franke have the spirit of 80s acid-jazz hanging over them but something else is hanging over good as the album is it doesnt add anything fresh to the 70s and 80s music that graef and his band so slavishly imitate and jazz-funk/rare groove enthusiasts already have a practically bottomless pile of original material from those eras to get through ts also unlikely to convert anyone not already tuned into this sound as you hear them whoop and hey in the studio on it becomes clear that is mostly just fun for max and his mates
everything about this release screams buy me from the cover art which features a clown being transported in a cart pulled by geese and satan whispering in a pipe smokers ear maybe old nick really does own all the best tunes to the superior mastering and exquisite vinyl pressing this is a real work of art it also helps that the music attains the same high standards less abrasive and yet just as hypnotic as mdr006 s trades on the distinctive dubby beats and nuanced filtering that the basic channel/chain reaction school of techno has spawned thankfully avoids sounding like a dull copyist through his use of a swinging rhythm raw somewhat abrasive beats and the kind of screeching metallic riffs last heard on dr mottes klange der familie hurtling through the ether and s contribution lien is also in debt to a traditional sound namely chicago house but again the interpretation is excellent n aching acid tinged bass unfolds to reveal layers of synth richness eerie almost austere in places but never out of place amid the tumbling reverberated drums and heavy claps hopefully this records ghostly charms will have a similar effect on a wide audience

longstanding collaborator with tadd mullinix as 2 m/fm (mullinix is better known to house fans as james t cotton and to breakbeat fans as dabrye) as well as traxx dmarc cantu has recently made some arty fudge-dense house 12-inches for a couple of labels notably cr me organization is a good bit lighter in feel than its predecessors airier with the aquatic feel and simple languid melody of late 80s house taking to the stars and setting the stage (however unwittingly) for early trance helped along by a squabbly tweaked loop of envelope-filter noise is simpler harder and closer to cantus cr me style: the 808 thrums big and hard and theres a sticky feel to the production overall typified by the humid-sounding electro-handclaps ut here the top end is more defined than usual less boxed in as abstracted voices and a curling mutating synth line fight for space theres such an abundance of lo-fi house right now that to hear someone going in the other direction is refreshing
after fully immersing himself in r b inflected liquid drum bass with last years chroma chords returns with the brawniest ep hes released since dark days appearing on exit for the first time sees moving in the spaces between footwork and drum bass that have recently become the labels domain is a collaboration with footwork kingpins and and the chicago duos r b on amphetamines schtick is such a perfect match for s style that it should have happened sooner as you might expect its like a cut from s double cup reinforced with a steely drum bass chassis and it sets a high standard for the rest of the ep with its low frequency quakes comes close to matching it but just when you think its about to explode into a friction style banger it slips into a more careful undulating groove with grime style bass stabs chopped vocals and stuttering percussion bears some resemblance to sam binga om nits 170 bpm experiments on exit the lead footed step of the collaboration meanwhile owes more to dubstep specifically the short lived purple strain but the duo sound like theyre sitting on their hands as it wobbles on listlessly not all the ideas on are fleshed out as well as but a half successful experiment is still better than the same old
listening to the non-dance efforts of dance producers is always revealing free from the necessary restrictions of 4/4 these projects as is commonly thought - allow artists to be more experimental more expressive and less hemmed in by the restrictions imposed by club formats the results can go either way though when tim hecker set loose his billowing grey clouds from the regimented beats of his jetone project his music grew all the richer on the other hand the bouncing tones and naive melodies of nathan fake s drowning in a sea of love drifted off into snoresville; it was bland in the way that only dm can be swedish artist has never restricted himself to any one genre producing acidic minimal techno and less structured electronica for a host of labels in equal measure falls into the latter category and builds upon an earlier vinyl edition formerly released on merck essentially a travelogue around lars hometown of these tracks are filled with sounds culled from old tapes of a young lar singing playing instruments and making various noises along with more recent equally personal recordings including lars father on trumpet the meowing family cat and chirping neighbourhood birds as lar states: musically its probably inspired by all the music ve listened to over the years so you see its a very personal album for me this might lead you to expect a warm nostalgic journey through resonant patches of sound but anyone familiar with lars earlier releases will not be surprised to find something quite different filtered through lars laptop the of his childhood becomes like a david lynch film: a dark harrowing nightmare yet also achingly beautiful introduces pads as lush as ulf lohmanns alongside a backdrop teeming with subtle activity and casio beats which skip like boards of canada a notch above ambient music the same intricate details swarm by blurred in as though viewed from the window of a speeding train while ticker tape taps scroll past biological moans and groans and morbid mournful synth pads all put together like the bleakest electro comes closest to being a pleasant memory with muffled piano chords shimmering like budd and eno while part skips slowly by in 4/4 the drums mere tics while birds sing and water drips in some dank and horribly lonely place aside from the sounds of birds the most prevalent theme in is echo as though lar has thrust these memories into a deep cavernous underground the resultant reverberant gloom present in all of these finely constructed tracks is frequently riveting and the wealth of detail lar has packed in offers much more than misery to the attentive listener
if youre familiar with the writing of thomas cox (aka pipecock) on ra his blog infinite state machine and many a dance-music forum youre bound to get a kick out of the fact that his new recording project a trio with fellow pittsburghers adam ratana and preslav lefterov is called cox an opinionated and sometimes cantankerous writer and dj aims to be nothing if not authoritative a staunch supporter of classic american dance music values he puts his money where his mouth is released on londons label home to classically minded house producers like lerosa cassy and move d its a fine addition to the canon with carefully cut drum grooves and smartly applied synthesizers contributing to the moody laidback funk at 118 bpm is the most uptempo of the four tracks here balancing rhodes chords string vamps and squealing portamento synths it sounds a little like metro area perhaps with an added dose of g-funk the rhythm carved out of funk or disco breaks is incredibly light on its feet all rimshots and delicate hi-hat figures with a handclap to die for impact slows down joining minor-key synths and faintly acidic bass with a rolling conga break as elsewhere you can guess that the samples came from well-loved vinyl: theyre filtered in a way that emphasizes the cracks and pops lending the textures an appealingly wood-grained feel is the slowest thing here and perhaps the most distinctive with a rolling percussive groove evocative of samba glancing dub chords sampled chants and sub-bass you can feel in your bones admittedly im a sucker for anything at this tempo but their take on slow-motion house is unusually elastic 77b takes the record out on a high note with white-hot drum loops against a backdrop of twittery birdsong and carefully interwoven rhodes and bass they even show a little love for their cross-state rivals in the form of soaring philly-soul string pads

this is s fourth release and first on it hews very closely to the template there are skippy hats and clipped precise melodic bleeps the kick drums thump in hard and satisfying it s all nicely constructed and builds as it should it ll keep people on the dancefloor but is unlikely to entice wallflowers to leave their seats nd that s because there are no surprises here oth sides feel as though they could have come out on at any point in the last three years it s textbook minimal if you love the sound you should still give this a listen but non-devotees can give it a miss i don t want to join in the chorus of there s too much boring minimal because basically this is true of every genre however there is too much boring and its something this veteran label needs to address before we all stop checking for their releases
since 2002 honest jons has been one of the strongest anthologizers of local scenes on the planet whether it be 1970s lagos 1920 s baghdad 1970 s cuban new york or 1920 s black london the label has been able to highlight the unique moment when indigenous communities cross paths with western culture at their best honest jon s like soul jazz and soundway offer an eye opening portrait of a rich musical world that s long been left behind label has been paying especially close attention to the work of nigerian drummer who currently plays drums in good bad and queen the band fronted by former blur singer and honest jon s co foun r damon albarn two years ago they released what has been since dubbed s comeback album lagos no shaking record was s first work to be recor d on nigerian soil since the early 80s and though it didn t match the urgency and sense of discovery that came with his initial outings in the late 60s with fela kuti the slower pace nevertheless showcased the afrobeat pioneer reconnecting with the vibe that had at least ma his early albums so engaging ever since its release honest jon s has been making a concerted effort to connect s brand of afrobeat with the current world of dance music issuing a series of limited run 12 inch remixes and remakes that have put tracks from that album in the hands of a new generation of dance producers among them carl moritz von mark ernestus and diplo finally collects ten of those singles onto one disc in an attempt to reassert as a pioneer of proto dance music for today s audiences its not hard to see where hj was coming from afrobeat s influence on the template of western dance music can be felt everywhere these days even though we don t readily note it anymore and as the musical director of fela kuti s africa 70 and egypt 80 bands played a large role in shaping that sound afrobeat fused indigenous african music with unwieldy american jazz imports and the compulsive funk of james brown culminating in the kind of marathon percussive transcen ntalism that has found its way into everything from tom moulton s early disco edits to the more tribal aspects of early house and techno the drum and bass movement and even all the way through to ricardo villalobos reliance on polyrhythmic beat patterns in minimal techno s early arrangements focused on hypnotic and often minimal cycles of drums bass and brass that joined together in a strong locked vibe though 2006 s lagos no shaking opted for jazzier more song oriented fare all of the interpreters taking a go at the material for the 12 inch series appear to be in agreement that they would use the source tapes to inject something of those earlier leaner productions to gui their tracks in the end that collective cision consciously ma or not is what holds this disc together whether it be the baile funk of diplo the towering dub techno of moritz von and mark ernestus the leftfield jazz of or the samba of de the base remains the same: a more organic more intuitive and frankly messier (in the best sense) approach to building a groove chicago s s de and egypt s hone in on the massive horns and crisp syncopated drumming to pull off their remakes in carl s hands has its tight structure unhinged and amped up; he stretches apart the bongos vocals and bass giving them space to breathe and then strings them all together again with an insistent synth stab and a kick drum diplo on the other hand livers a virtual tam tam session of competing drums bongos and drum machines even moritz von s ten minute mix brings in the bongos for one of the more refreshing tracks he s offered up in recent years only mark ernestus relies on the funk bass for mark s turning in a slow burning dub track that is one of the best of many highlights here not all the tracks end up as memorable and those that don t register a strong impression tend to stick a bit too closely to the template they know in re working bon doesn t do much more than recreate the increasingly predictable style of two dimensional baile funk party tracks they ve become known for meanwhile dizze rascal prot g s push their mix of tetsuya s too far into grimey synth territory to warrant any real comparison to s original it s all very energetic and functional but like the bondo mix tetsuya doesn t really attempt any kind of relationship with the original apart from a few errant samples which is a shame because here their contributions stand out as weak spots among the company of eight other heavy hitters from around the globe all of who have ma use of this opportunity to push the rich afrobeat influence into their own brand of club music given that dance music s origins are neither european nor north american revisiting s work like this offers a timely remin r that the most reliable producers we have today are the ones who consistently reach outsi the framework of current club music for their percussive potentials

youd hardly expect to be able sit still long enough to write something suitably straightforward and floor-filling for will sauls but with hes done it and redshape has provided two remixes that send it right back down the rabbit hole the original has a determined thud and a bicep-esque vocal as if read is trying his best to nail down a no-bullshit retro house groove his penchant for weirdness is left to the chords which shimmy awkwardly just a step behind the beat redshapes remix sound trippy by comparison he lays down a pedestrian beat and then lets compressed bits of the original stutter and spray out wildly essentially built on spasmodic glitching its hard not to imagine its exaggerated effects on a druggy afterhours dance floor his version recasts as a tough techno tool but is hard to take seriously with its pitched-down-to-hell vocals and thinly stretched chords read dips into disco mode with this one cracks its own foundations wide open for more spastic bursts of melody before snapping back into a tight groove might be reads most accessible work but its not his most exciting
electronic music celebrating the joys and conveniences of contemporary urban life is rare - were not about to hear a grime rendition of petula clarks downtown anytime soon pleasant recordings of the domestic realm are not surprisingly more commonplace when one is sat at home bored with computer and microphone close to hand it is both tempting and easy to try and make music from your immediate surroundings is the latest release from new york native and founder taking its cue from french philosopher michel de certeau s the practice of everyday life a 1974 text which details how individuals transform and thereby personalize elements of mass culture rituals utilitarian objects language street plans etc honig incorporates recordings of household objects and life outside his bedroom walls into his understated ambient compositions the most immediate antecedent to this project is rob ellis music for the home a two-volume set of pieces involving domestic sounds electronics and simple keyboard compositions also brought to mind is herberts around the house involving similar source material but set to a house music framework sits somewhere between the two with honig creating a backdrop of pretty processed clatter from recorded objects over which he adds simple keyboard patterns and cushioned glitch beats opener going sailing refrain 1 acts as a formless introduction before concrete and plastic establishes the vocabulary in use throughout the album against a background of tinkered domestic sounds (cutlery/fumbled dice/rattled computer keys ) and external street noise (muffled voices strained traffic footsteps) a regular tempo is softly tapped out and faded keyboard melodies are lazily unfurled tones change dark pads rumble into the picture conflicting lines of musique concret dance left to right and rhythms subtly alter but the tempo remains constant (somnambulant) and there are no surprises going sailing refrain 2 and 3 a single piece is for some reason spread over two tracks and together barely exceeds three minutes books on tape slumps by in sleepy 4/4 alongside a prominent vocal tic and a subway screech with all edge removed fractures and fissures parts 1 and 2 (again two tracks) dispenses with rhythm and produces the albums highlight(s): an indistinct aqueous drone aided by chirping snatches of guitar and dying synth pads there is plenty of fine detail which warrants close listening (only possible on headphones) however the sounds on offer throughout are limited and each piece too monotonous to hold interest for long the connection to de certeau is tenuous with field recording in todays electronica commonplace and blase furthermore the restriction to using only personal objects or personalized external sounds is indulgent particularly when compared with the politicized sampling of herbert or matmos drifts by effortlessly and demands little and is easily forgotten

its hard to tell how many days into a studio session howie b craig richards was produced but the state of s wailing suggests it was at least a few this three-track 7-inch totalling just under ten minutes of music is as catchy as it is sentimental pairing electro beats with pads and flashes of melancholy the first half of the title track is funky and fun as a maniacal blurts nonsensical syllables interspersed with cries of old booooooys over a slamming 808 breakbeat but a pad that arrives halfway through flips the mood turning this otherwise goofy track nostalgic is a two-minute sketch with insect sounds more wacky vocals la la la la la and a plodding beat its tropical but technoid pulse gives it a motorised drive despite its title is the eps most emotional track the tempo nosedives while synths twinkle ending with a mood that depending on your state of mind might be bliss or despair
warm might be the word most often used in reference to peter kerstens music it describes the gentle and welcoming aura of his tracks but it could just as aptly be used in the goldilocks sense as in not too hot not too cold s kersten has made a career out of subdued house with a temperature range that sits between fiery heat and chilliness on his latest album that moderation is both a blessing and a curse the cover art drawn by kerstens go-to illustrator stefan marx depicts the albums titular mid-tokyo oasis is sparsely sketched yet its lushness is evident and these ten tracks largely follow suit pairs its stripped-down rhythm with a rich melancholic melody and shimmering piano adding an atmosphere of bittersweet comfort one of the many spectral moments is all cathedral chords punctuated by short bursts of iridescent keys the loping breakbeats of va joined by percussive pings and a backdrop of muted synths find a pleasing balance of velvety opulence and understated funk the downside to kerstens hushed elegance is that the music can feel overly tame particularly when taking in front to back theres a hazy atmosphere that drifts throughout the tracks hypnotic as it is the fog can grow dull with its shimmering synths and muted chords is gorgeous but also a bit slight is one of the most propulsive cuts but when stripped down to its beat and a rubbery synth it nearly becomes invisible but kersten has enough tricks up his sleeve to keep his music from fading completely into the background on he layers on a carl craig-esque percussive phrase to give the wispy song an added dynamic there are rich bass tones all over grounding the music with a vital density without its low-end would be dreamy synth glissandos and little else but underpinned by its thick bassline those melodies become an ascending interval of house nirvana is at its best on the tracks where kersten wanders out of his comfort zone with its electro syncopation and jazz-tinged keys for instance delivers some necessary angles; the jacking nd rrows is defined by a playful loop that exudes a fun disco-meets-detroit vibe kersten is one of the best there is when it comes to this kind of dreamland house but tracks like these make a strong case for him expanding his reach more often
s twitchy high-tempo tracks sound like a sea of spiders scuttling away rather than the sounds we would normally associate with drums when its infused with dubstep-friendly low-end the result is something thats almost queasy its the reason why his r podcast was one of the years most surprising and more importantly flat-out amazing on these two tracks for 7even further explores dubstep tempos pivots itself on a spectral bassline and the hazy remnants of a chord progression some percussive sounds and resonant samples provide bits of colour but its like a rainbow shining through the barred window of a solitary confinement cell like most of s work it doesnt really go anywhere preferring to keenly explore the curious space it creates the flipside doesnt let much more light in and this time the drums sound dry and brittle crumbling with every hit the bassline flickers like a bad signal over broken chord washes its all a little unsettling especially if you let yourself get lost in the vast swathes of empty space
japan might seem an odd place to look for what might now be considered purist dubstep but look no further than - for your 2006-style fix indeed takeaki maruyama was one of the genres earliest outside adopters even releasing an entire album full of mostly breaks-driven dubstep in 2005 perhaps as a result of his explicit jungle roots his tracks have a fluid energy and attention to detail to them that turns early dubsteps deliberate and careful stomp on its head obscured by paranoia and all kinds of percussive flourishes his latest twelve for malas deep medi label sounds right out of 2007 or so: and considering the admittedly sluggish pace of the labels release timetable maybe thats not so far off from the truth however old they are theres no denying their effectiveness is ultra-classic: shattering kicks grinding synths guttural bass ut maruyamas signature is quite different than digital mystikz-style minimalism instead it swings flowing bongos on top of the beat lending it a pseudo-tribal feeling thats as suffocating as it is menacing dialing up the dub with plucked strings and a heavily staggered progression is d which sounds slightly dated with its loud and dissonant wobble even when his tracks are at their most regressive however they always sound full : its hard not to get steamrolled by maruyamas sheer heft a thickset weight that sounds almost inaudible (but certainly physically tangible) amidst all the fastidious detail present even in a fairly obvious track like d -trads an implacable figure all around and his tunes are never quite what they seem s a result even his most derivative moments can sound fresh
sign of the times perhaps when s first appeared in 2008 dubstep was comfortable at right around 140 pm nowadays weve gone slower and joe turns in a remix at right around 130 pm the result is no less rhythmically fascinating than the original joe softens things up however with a simple rhodes chord that works against the frantic melody that buried under bass weight even drum bass producer rockwell cant stay away from the space that 130 pm affords his mix is thick full of dread chords and tribal clatter you could mix it into shackleton if you wanted it has the same sort of nervous ticks presented in a far straighter way but youd have to pitch it up most likely not sure how weve arrived here to be honest ut im sure glad we have
hooj head honcho red jerry returns to the release schedule with his latest production bj robson is on vocals and it s another venture into the dancefloor mayhem that rj is well known for disc one on the a-side is red jerry s banned from the roxy mix the track begins with the usual quirky drum patterns of rj s work and a little screechy sampled sound floating around an electro synth soon makes its impact as the track slowly builds rj introduces a deep baseline really giving the production a good groove the filtered vocals of bj soon take effect vocals that strangely sound very familiar to a certain popular band from a few years back but nowhere near as irritating the track maintains a great feel throughout with the vocals working very well with all sound elements another stellar track by rj on the flip is red jerry s airtight mix this mix begins with a deep bouncy baseline that will immediately impress not as in your face as the first mix it makes great use of smooth strings and a smoother aura on the whole a quirky little melody midway through is a strength of the track a element that gives it a bit of a funky edge as well another good production from rj that is vastly different from the roxy mix disc two on the a-side is red jerry s cut one mix this mix is extremely similar to the airtight mix using a very if not the same baseline and elements of the funky melodies seen in the airtight mix however it lacks the smooth strings and deep house aspect that the airtight mix was good for the vocals are also more scattered and not as structured a solid mix on the b-side is nova scotia s aversion version despite the tongue twisting title this mix holds very smooth and is not as intense as the rj mixes smooth beats flow with a slow and delicate baseline the vocals are smothered with warmth as the production flows smoothly for its duration one for the sunday afternoon files another solid release from hooj and from red jerry personally if you were a fan of the brilliant what colour is love then this release is sure to tickle the taste buds yet again
label head obviously likes a challenge if you were choosing a record from neil youngs canon to give an electronic makeover there are surely likelier candidates than takes the canadian folk rockers original a smacked-out dark alt-rock ramble and turns it into a smacked-out dark sub-coldwave ramble built around a throbbing choppy analogue rhythm and s heavily vocodered voice its a valiant effort but it feels like it needs a further twist he doesnt give it the kind of comprehensive makeover that another young mainstay ly love can break your heart was afforded by st etiennes 1990 balearic revisit for example s cray 76 remix fares better it veers further away from the stoned ennui of youngs version through booming snares percussive pitter-patter and tumbling synths principles work languid dubsteppy atmospherics and pinky perky vocals into their version but its cfcf who provides the highlight remix canadian producer reintroduces the guitar acrobatics from youngs original and confidently/foolishly works in some sultry sax and twinkling guitar washes for a modern balearic take
for those who have been admiring fred p for a while now the music on deep things will come as no surprise s been played out by plenty and was largely featured on his mix for underground qualitys gig at tape in berlin like nina kravizs recent 12-inch for uq however its nice to finally have it all one place things begin lightly with whose delicate pads and funky melody are enough to get you going even without the dreamy strings that fly in from the heavens s elegantly constructed house music that sounds perfect for a sunday morning sunrise black light meanwhile is the track that gets you to that point building an intense head of steam that explodes after the halfway mark into panning and crisscrossing synths that closes it out nicely the synths are unexpected but they more than earn their keep leavening what has been a relatively intense and lengthy introduction does what it says on the tin with a visceral kick filthy acid line and what sounds like a choir ooing up and down and closes things out with tinkling keys and dreamy atmospherics the meat here is in the and two tracks that instantly vault fred into a master class of deep house technicians (if he wasnt already there before ) like compatriot levon vincent the elements that he uses arent exactly new but he puts them together in such a way that its hard to point to many originators of what hes doing right now a few months ago i suggested that were coming up to the point where we have to call the subtle tweaks to a well-worn formula that vincent is doing a genre on its own if this keeps up we may have to do the same for fred as well

uk-based frenchman is a stalwart of london promoters half baked who have been a feature of the capitals sunday club scene for half a decade ordell is not the most prolific producer preferring to concentrate on dj duties but three years ago he created a mild kerfuffle with the show a slice of bouncy deep house that neatly sampled a moodymann dialogue from his rbma lecture his latest ep however struggles to reach the same heights ordell has a penchant for meandering fluid grooves but hes just a little too enthusiastic in his deployment of them in places they feel overly long as if hes trying to create extended run-outs for djs rather than editing the track down to its essence that said he certainly knows how to create an addictive bassline as the wobbling rubbery example on shows bishopsgate isnt a quantum leap forward from the lead track; the percussion crackles and the watery bassline bumps in all the right places but it outstays its welcome as it heads into its eighth minute veras remix strips away the percussion replacing it with eerie twitterings hi-hat vignettes and odd discordant rumbles which instantly make it more interesting sees ordell delving into the uk garage playbook snares skip like a kid oding on sugar and a prodding bassline and truncated vocal sample make it the most entertaining of ordells three productions

two years ago ras terrence fuller handily described twitchy structures and organic palettes as house music being reimagined from the ground up on more recent tracks like chicago pimp though its more like house rolled down a hill his new one for madrids explorer is a case in point its ragged tinny palpitations dumped into a front loader and set on tumble dry its not without the usual deep signifiers youll hear plaintive ripples of piano soul jazz electric keys and flutters of organ but even these seem to topple over one another in jostles and lurches and yet for all the scraping and dissonance a soft spoken calm catches you off guard moments like these and there were more than a few secured as a vintage year for this singular master light of such recent highlights who could blame you for succumbing to a bout of nostalgia for the unwound psychedelic rhythms of his erstwhile psychostasia imprint explorer co founder dubbymanns certainly feeling it delivering a pair of tributes a lot of dubbymans remix work boils down to little more than supplementing the languorous deep house drifters he loves with a little punch and muscle here however he assembles lonely uptown mood pieces out of disparate parts gathered from the psychostasia archives his rework of 001s folds in the static pads from missing you and the sermon from interstitial piece speech at a slowed pulse much of the same material echoes through the mix of a sort of cherry on top you also get by one originally slated for release through psychostasia before the label went into hibernation its coolheaded hand drums and limpid rhodes chords wont have much trouble finding willing jocks in 010 nor should they with coasting blue grooves as fluid as these
ristol internal affair describes legendary record shop hardwax where the first release on new imprint appeared hand-stamped white label of course simultaneously along with ristol shop idle hands nd its a pretty accurate description taking up both sides of the release is about as ristol as you could get: two of the citys most intriguing and often heavy eye-lidded producers collaborating on a barebones framework each taking the result home and having their way with it the end product is the kind of house-informed wounded rave music that has been defining the citys output as of late though the sides are unlabelled each producers version is so essentially them that its impossible to mistake otherwise peverelists mix mines the same twitchy junglist hysteria of his work on hessle udio a nearly constant stream of snares and hats dancing around a broken beat kick kowtons mix is minimal: sleepy and ominous his unique feet-dragging percussion scratches out a hypnotically circular polyrhythm pevs beat pulled apart and scattered the tracks drop is like a reanimated corpse tired and weighty yet surprisingly agile more than anything else paints the picture of kowton as ristols fastest-rising star over an ever-growing amount of peers no one else in the city makes music as creepy (dig those decaying creaks that blanket his mix) or as universal as this
last year toronto resident graham bertie returned from a two-year break with an ep on chicago label the nite owl diner ras patric fallon called that one a fresh start leaning towards a richer more melodic sound away from the caustic techno he worked with on turbo reflections released through is said to be the result of choosing to stay in more than go out these dense colourful dance tracks dont feel like they were written with the floor in mind as bertie switches melodies and instrumentation so quickly that they never really soak in this is an issue on and where bertie overcooks the groove rather than letting it simmer could have been a fine house track but it sounds more like three of them mashed together the other two tracks are better the little changes gradually building to a satisfying energy level rather than depleting it is especially glorious full of percussive details like the sliver of a drum break that skips through the second half and deploys its acid lead wonderfully those two suggest that bertie has an ear for glossy sounds and catchy melodies he just needs to remember to make rhythms to match
a pair of eps on washington d c s future times label - (aaron leitko and ft co-founder mike petillo) hop the atlantic for a spot on piers harrison and chris galloways imprint if youve heard their previous records youll know what theyre up to here: graceful resolutely analog house and techno in the vein of legowelt or omar-s or the l i e s label by turns prickly bleepy and straight-up dreamy begins with a bouncy 808 pattern and pert arpeggios before blowing wide open beneath cascading fifths; drums shudder synths swirl is a lo-fi slo-mo drum track that eventually sprouts an eerie halo of shimmering dissonant pads; similarly paced brings together chiming chords and dubby congas theyre all great but none of them come close to the understated beauty of a sweet plucky little deep house lullaby that carries the faintest echo of lcd soundsystems someone great
five years operation has seen the sydney-based rack up a diverse catalogue with contributions ranging the efforts globetrotting europeans (robert babicz ramon tapia) to part-time producers scattered throughout australia (rif raf murat ) now 33 releases in beef have enlisted the services northern irish duo on the rise adds to the beef catalogue with bass-heavy tech house cut thick with congas and brass samples clocking in at just under eight minutes for the most part seems just a tad too busy vocals are arranged in homage to chicago but ultimately seem to fall short on achieving their intended significance the remix front is an all-australia affair mic leads the way with a dark and rhythmic fering enhancing the originals bassline with a distorted layer instrumentation garry gets spacey making use an arching synth line and a series energetic drum patterns launching into a four-minute chicago throwback at the tracks midway point both remixes in staying true to the original render themselves rather constrained by its hyperactivity but nonetheless serve as handy club tools founders shades strip away most the originals bustle putting together a relatively minimal remix that creeps forward with warped vocals and infectious hand claps despite its b-side allocation murat s deep rework stands as the releases most dance floor friendly track structurally the most simplistic take on the original s accessible bass vocal reverb and banging drums happily takes into peaktime territory as a result their comparatively minimalist nature the stripped back efforts shades and are the highlights this package
one of spains most promising young electronic labels arkestra returns with their second release from galician producer and occasional vocalist for fans of modern r b spanish pop and nostalgic piano house stabs the ep has plenty on offer the title track oozes with liquid funk from the start in fact it would be difficult to squeeze out more synth juice than the existing twisted and hypnotic r b spell in the first minute-and-a-half cue some piano house stabs and the equally nostalgic ooh and yeah -ing vocals at the halfway mark to take the track in a more direct direction before returning to the previous slow and hot night groove on flexes her vocal prowess on top of racing horns and sharp stabs takes on some more direct alt-pop references that ends in a half-step calypso sunset of epic vocals and keys reminding of the rare 80s b-side that you wish you discovered in your parents collection rolling forward another decade or so label mate noaipre steamrolls into a vintage garage joint worthy of the genres better years
a difference an apostrophe ( a simple rearranging of words) makes: music under review here was originally supposed to be called sound of the : but someone thought better changed it to sound of the : s former implies that was/is the sound of the city which the former n chic head most definitely never was latter simply allows the current circo loco resident to simply do what he does best which he has no problem doing here over the course of two discs on this 90s themed mix sound of around the time that returned to france after a stay in california was decidedly not the type of bouncy west coast house that he had fallen in love with his famed batofar residency was influential but was never mainstream boat can only hold so many people you see ) remembers taking records from go that he bought for less than a dollar re selling them for 30 francs thats probably all you need to know when determining how unique s collection was at the time in wasnt that skilled he admits just had fantastic records internet has changed the l scape of buying 1 inches forever geography bar a few far flung places no longer plays much of a role ts the way that you put them together has now had years of practice his skills have clearly caught up to the tunes sound of the you can hear him pulling off effortless mixes in key cutting out of records at just the right moment knows these records inside out who else would know to fade s in the organ lick directly into s wobbly lead line on most of the tracks on here are a decade old (or more) produced right before the minimal wave that n chic itself took part in each tune has something memorable about it (if not multiple things) t doesnt always work exactly move into epic territory near the end of disc one feels forced can hear the glide of bpms being raised or lowered in a noticeable way in the mix every so often but as proof as to why became such a force in the house techno scene sound of the is a valuable document t may not have been the sound of the entire city but it was the sound of enough of the city to still matter in
co-founder j albert has been busy in the past two years hes issued nearly ten records of smudgy hardware-style house you get the sense that the ridgewood queens resident real name jiovanni nadal often gets home from work and sits dutifully at his machines crafting loads of lo-fi house jams that find homes on labels like black opal and 1080p as polarizing as outsider house initially was its yielded emotive classics like terekkes amaze and florian kupfers feelin nadal also reaches such heights on occasion: februarys thank you for believing in me was a distilled slice of dance floor joy on a collection of highlights from a 2015 cassette of the same name the title track has a more contemplative vibe but nadal is again at his best mixing a funky sample with pitched-down hats and blurry pads its a smudge house take on the 90s vocal tradition with a diva who sounds distant and cartoonish nidal gives her a lovely counterpoint in the sedate piano that lolls in the hazy background the recording quality on reflects this records slapdash beginnings the lo-fi luomo-style jam which otherwise emphasizes nadals delicate touch on the keys is hampered by palpable tape hiss craftily merges chicago acid into a set of funky uk garage-style chords and its lack of sheen is charming and hammers home just how much nadals ear for samples sets him apart the cut starts off with the moody synths and clanging hi-hats youd expect but only when he introduces a degraded funk sample does it really take off on-point bass and a meandering melodic lead snatched off some dusty record add color and whimsy to j alberts insular world
sami suyung is the production alias of the recently married couple sami yenigun and joyce lim alongside dawit eklund they run the exciting dc label theres a vibrant harmony beaming through ethics the couples first ep together this creative rapport wasnt always there in a recent truants interview the pair said they had been struggling to make music together for years they clicked during a two-week period after they married which resulted in the four tracks on ethics whirlwind is a good word to describe ethics the tunes begin with functional intros but dont sit still for long none reach the six-minute mark but they cover lots of ground has an unrelenting maelstrom of synthetic flourishes that could make floating points blush they fizzle like particles in the large hadron collider the buccaneering seems to take inspiration from max d a local dc hero s pitched between the crazed rhythms of his lo percussion project and the glistening optimism of his debut lp cool water st of all however is the skittering jackhammer-style drums are complemented by a naive melody that conjures up childhood memories of the rugrats theme
is a classic man since 2013 the melbourne producer born mike katz has refined his smooth well-mannered house into a kind of low-key funk youll recognize one of his records from its warm rhodes chords light-footed disco rhythms soulful synth leads and limber basslines all of which at least sound like they were performed and recorded live in the studio its likely they were too katz was at one point a session player and his intuitive musicianship shines through every song hes written and the two tracks on his first ep for danilo plessows label credit one tamil rogeon for his string arrangements its an important detail on a 12-inch that recreates a time when subtle details were of the utmost importance perhaps the biggest takeaway from is how full and vibrant it all sounds but its also worth noting how sutherland treats the vintage style without so much as a knowing wink for him theres nothing remotely insincere about a pitch-perfect homage to jazzy disco-funk and that energy pulses through each silky groove is the uptempo high-stepper complete with a fat bass synth and hard-smacking claps while fills out the b-side with deep bubbly soul they both seem to aim for the more restrained side of late 70s/early 80s t k disco fare and yet katzs ear for interwoven harmonies and natural performances lift them high above simple pastiche is a densely melodic and unabashedly joyous record the kind that sneaks up on a crowd and puts them in a frenzy before they realize why theyre moving

twenty eight year old - whos acclaimed influences include diversities from bob dylan to lauryn hill - is renowned for his heavily break influenced tracks featuring charasmatic jazzy rifts when listening to his new album it would be easy to mistake jasons productions for a score from the latest hollywood action film; not one of the twelve track lacks emotion and content heavy pounding breaks are enwrapped with classical and jazz synths and some tracks are softened by suiting lyrics the first track im in u features a male vocal and builds up into a heavy breaks track the second track secret places verges on the melodic and i must say a really nice female vocalist accompanies the track very well left 2 live 4 track 3 gives the impression of a somewhat dirtier industrial track heroes is a faster production and could almost be drum and bass overall the album shows ability to bring a wide range of different styles to breakbeat as i metioned it is hard to believe the quality and power of these productions and especially when you consider that jason produces most of his records at home on humble tools - a great credit to his ability

as the winnie the pooh imagery suggests (pronounced honey) makes music thats colourful and easy to digest his brand of fat jolly house makes generous use of r b and disco samples and hes released 12-inches on local talk lets play and puss the kiss-stamped imprint he runs with korn l kov cs for his first outing of he returns to catz n dogzs pet recordings the resulting five-tracker for the most part is grating the opening cut is called which should tell you something about the mood is going for on in fact its the least sugary and over-the-top thing here as mellow sea-breeze synths lap against loping drums youre left with a nice slice of trip-hop on the other hand is difficult to get through largely due to the cutesy vocal sample when its just sun-drenched piano playing over a laid-back groove is less trying but then a candyfloss melody wades in and everything becomes annoyingly chipper again the eps lowest ebb though is a toss up between the shrill synths on frukstund and the weird electro squelch of
that a track as straightforward as s binary opposition could spawn six such wildly varied offspring is a testament to the very concept of remixing the original a massive cut that didnt so much lumber as stampede has found many forms here: thunderous stomp in and fragmentation in and mid-range doggedness in van and but even these groupings feel somewhat arbitrary s version for instance has mostly kept the galloping bass between the beats while s has dropped it altogether in pursuit of a more stripped aesthetic the former is also differentiated by a lively chord-laden mid-section an element which was completely absent from the original in the hands of both and theres no room for this kind of prettiness the former whose debut was released by just a few months ago opts for a pummelling breakbeat placing searing stabs and ghoulish cries on top its the kind of thing thatd do well on perc trax s version is shot through with a warmer kind of melody but its still unsettling reinforcing the threat of the corroded beats which lurk below it s remix sounds strangely flattened theres very little bass to speak of and the high-end is all feathery scratch rather than metallic slice but true to form the belgian still finds plenty of room for detail festooning his beats in wiry synths and sending pulses of energy along their spans the final remix from is less fluid leading with a big abrasive motif that barely changes for the entire duration
one of the best attributes of s complex housing was how it worked in hints of house music and the producer explores this side of his music further on his first official follow-up on is like a curbstomp: the neanderthal thump is miles away from housing s nimble hopscotch and s white noise chords and wobbly snares feel like theyre being thrown around by the kick drum shlohmo and mysterious entity collaborate for a remix that shrouds in the same sunburnt screen of distortion as ad vibes internet sensation and new fof signees lol oys pull apart the rhythm and insert their usual assortment of skittery fidget rhythms into the slower template which ends up even more conventionally house than the original the eps other two tracks are just as tantalizing: is a sleazy collaboration with sf-sweet talker ravo the contrast of s tactile toms slathered in ravos undulating vocoder soul is as irresistible as any r slow jam finally theres which takes the twitchy percussion of and splays it over a backbone that sounds like its slipping on ice rather than pounding into the ground these arent exactly easy tracks but theyre easy enough to love with striking oil as he burrows deeper and deeper into his own rhythmic idiosyncrasies
so heres what we know: plus 8 the era-defining 90s techno label run by richie hawtin and john acquaviva released a new 12-inch this month with the number 25/1 the rest is a mystery we dont know who its by and hawtins camp claims to be unaware of its existence the only other detail to work with is a message on the records label: from my mind to yours a riff on the title of plus 8s seminal 1991 compilation from our minds to yours vol 1 with tracks from kenny larkin f u s e speedy j and others that release helped usher in a new era of minimalist techno from both sides of the atlantic this week 25/2 dropped suggesting this will be an ongoing 25th anniversary series whatever the story may be the music on 25/1 doesnt quite justify the records mystique what you get are three cuts in the lean and spooky style of artifakts [bc] -era plastikman though the spirit is more nostalgic than forward-thinking is a fairly standard acid tool albeit one that would nicely maintain tension in a techno set is a beat workout thats absorbing enough strobing and oblique with eerie pads and the occasional backwards loop though it too is a bit reserved has more oomph than the other two thanks to a snappy hi-hat pattern and an assertive two-tone bassline all three feel safe compared to the classic plus 8 stuff theyre referencing much of which still sounds dangerous a quarter of a century later to properly live up to that legacy youd need a record with sharper teeth than 25/1
aybee has debuted a new alias bazile republic for s 10th release and once you hit play on you can see why res an intensity and velocity that is atypical of aybees recent work and this is most apparent on the eps title track ts unyielding kicks and rich tones have a techno sensibility but the tracks softer percussive pieces shakers tambourines subtle tribal snares keep it supple arid synth lines on sound like a poker-faced trance/techno crossover t makes the track sound dramatic in that stiff way that some 90s techno does but it takes the best parts of that energy and distils it aybees past music is more recognisable on the disordered satellite bleeps of but even here it feels guided more by the spaced-out techno of say terrence dixon than aybees oft-cited muse ron trent
uk producer has always managed to make the sparest drum bass sound lifelike which is a harder task than youd think hes been widening the horizons of the genre since before its current wave of ambitious experimentalists and his latest single is no different: lean and just a little adventurous is the perfect example of this: it starts out crackly almost like 8 bit drum bass then it careens into this strange ascending progression that reminds me more than a little of super mario bros squeaky little sound effects and pixelated trills bookend a powerful track full of jazzy bass runs and drums skittering outside the confines of their measure the flipside pairs him with frequent collaborator hellrazor and sounds like a homage to calibre via its deliberate ivory pounding s panoramic vocal samples and sing songy chords are convincing enough but it feels slightly shallow next to the astute
its like translating an idiom from one language to another and back again only literally what was once a disco hit for loleatta holloway ( hit and run ) became a techno classic for carl craig now have re imagined yet again as a hybrid of the two styles: craigs same techno arrangement played on the live instruments of a disco band its been a treat for attendees of the groups concerts over the past few years and epitomises the crossover sensibility upon which their wide popularity is built its the kind of referential nod which is perfect encore fodder at a gig a great hidden bonus on a cd though on 12 inch ill still be reaching for the flips remastered original for despite the enticingly dark transposition to minor james murphys falsetto hands in the air summons or the unruliness of live compared to the neatness of techno alongside its superlatively timeless predecessor s like for like cover is little more than an enjoyable but passing novelty

dominik eulberg the favourite minimal son of traum and mother nature returns with a classy 2 that continues to extend his signature sound although arriving with familiar motifs such as zoological titles and a beautiful cover depicting birds at a lake the two ten minute-plus tracks here are a little non-native to the ecosystem of his past work but only a little despite retaining a motorik drive both tracks are purer and more airy than the dirty dancefloor swagger and humorous acid buzz of his previous singles and the still wonderful debut album flora and fauna the individual sounds here certainly don t get as sonically muddy as the landmark single rotbauchunken vom tegernsee stead the lightness length and slow evolution of these tracks shows a new patience and attention to detail from eulberg this is particularly true of the a-side where you can stand back mesmerised ticking the sounds off as they appear and disappear in often surprising ways you might not notice them change at all such is their subtlety the main synth buzz perhaps mimics sounds of a lakeside although it comes across as a little neurotic after ten minutes danceable enough but somehow more textured than groovy by contrast b-side alpenstrandl ufer von is more up-front the percussion and ambient samples do not intrude too closely at first letting the melodic line chimes peacefully over the apparent stillness before the track progresses into slightly denser club friendly waters those looking for more after diving into heimische gefilde would do well to pick this 2 up
s techno has a shape-shifting quality that has evolved across the 15 eps hes released on his label the bristol mainstay otherwise known as nick harris has avoided typical self-promotion while releasing a diverse array of imaginative club tracks with bright and bold motifs that speak to technos playful roots the boisterous is a fine example opening the ep with a muscular rhythm that wouldnt sound out of place on a surgeon record its far from a straight-up drum track though the pile-driving percussion is offset by soaring synths that hark back to the sweeter inflections of 2 the tightly wound funk of has a whiff of robert hood in its textural accents while channels early underground resistance especially in its wriggling synth lines this distillation of influences while not wholly original results in techno loaded with character but its the mellower tones of that shine brightest channeling a dubby sensibility that nods to harriss home town
ah classical music and uplifting vocal trance two genres i know nothing about but i m a professional and professionals do research and so i googled ultramax to find out the what-ho turns out that ultramax is just plain old max who is a russian american guy who writes books on c++ and makes music inspired by the giants of german music wolfgang amadeus mozart and paul van dyk he s also been interviewed on the telly but i m not quite sure why blending dance music and classical is that newsworthy (my mum bought me hooked on classics for christmas in 1982) so this is trance and turns out this stuff is crazy popular in ibiza and judge jules has called max s stuff infectious so i m all excited really getting to hear a new kind of music for the first time like going to a new country and taking the first bite of their foreigner food listening without prejudice i imagine that a-side all you need would fit right in at a commercial trance night on ibiza but i wouldn t really know because i ve never been there so in the interest of good journalism and science i tried replicating the ibiza experience by turning up the track and dancing about my living room result: it made me wave my hands about like a japanese parapara girl the problem is that it doesn t groove it gallops this is a rhythm for clubbing in jodhpurs but i m judging it for what it s not deep down it s just a pop song with a trance backbeat forget the classical gimmick but is it good pop music the best bit is one surprising chord change in the bridge and the nice melody sung by a computerized woman in the second half exhorting you to let go worries and fears troubles and sorrow love is all you need for tomorrow but uplifting trance this doesn t sound very uplifting to me it sounds plaintive and sad like something oprah winfrey would say to an abused guest so misnamed emotionally but kinda sweet on holiday with your computerized girlfriend in ibiza and she s trying to cheer you up the flipside is arwens song which worryingly features russian operetta singer eugenia zamchalova singing j r r tolkiens lyrics in elvish putting aside my irrational hatred of all things nerd of the rings i serenely gave it a spin i m not sure how to describe it really imagine you were sitting in the chillout room at a hard dance night fed up with your mates fed up with the relentless crapness of the music the muffled throb of which is emanating through the walls and you look up and there s peter jackson in a hole in the ceiling slowly lowering down a mermaid in a glowing shaft of light and the mermaid starts to sing to you in elvish via moscow out of sync with the monotonous doom-trance next door and it strikes you that the elvish wafting from the mermaid s mouth is the most beautiful sound you ve heard all night it would be time to go home wouldn t it so there it is computerized female synthesizer or russian operetta star i know who i d rather go on holiday with i read somewhere that all genres start 1) experimental then 2) go populist then get ever more 3) outlandishly baroque before finally 4) collapsing into kitsch ultramax s a-side is pitched at 2) but really is 3) and the b-side tries to be 3) but really is 4) c++

what can be said about jeff mills that hasnt been said already plenty actually as exhibitionist is the first mix cd hes released in eight years and when you think how the compilation market was in 1996 you being to realise what a lifetime that is the cd is accompanied by a dvd which on this evidence ought to be well worth watching three decks mixed live 45 tracks - no chance of getting bored here and mills mixing sounds so fresh and inventive he reels you in and has you hooked a good number of these tracks are from his own axis label but there are some notable surprises for instance the string-laden chords of alan barratts zulu nation part ix or the latino beats of victor simonellis bateria the moody sound of oscar muleros b2 from cr007 is more what i would have associated with mills rather than the lazy trumpet of danilo vigoritos knap one drawback with exhibitionist is the speed with which it moves - barely has a track had time to get going then its on to the next one however this also proves to be a huge advantage in this tour de force of mixing mills keeping a tight control on his material and somehow making it all hang together coherently a mix that demands to be heard even if it might make some of you techno djs weep over your headphones
catch in kenny glasgows voice made me wonder at first hes forlorn-sounding foggy and lonesome and he wavers around pitch so determinedly in the first couple minutes of s opening track that the first time through it registered as passive aggression is this mean yes its the album by the guys who did ras no 1 track of last year and that an urtis-like sepulchral quality (albeit pitched up some: glasgows a tenor to urtiss baritone) of tone and time had been the grabber there too but still an albums worth ll at least couldnt complain that glasgow and partner jonny white were running away from the thing that had made people care fact it was exactly the opposite gloriously so is that rare thing: an album that takes everything good about a spectacular single and draws out its possibilities for its entire length glasgows singing is breathy and nervy and it flickers out of the speakers just enough to lure you in a job the grooves complete tracks here are spare and deliberate: simple drum machines sprinkles of programmed percussion one-handed keyboard bass cheap asio chords muttered spoken vocal overdubs the one of two cuts with (the other was the original a-side of ) makes s debt to 80s hicago house explicit by throwing in a quote from s donnie while the percussion track of 1) slowly dissolves revealing its similarities to loose joints s all over my face but those are winks not crutches like l d system or the first luomo album these are long tracks dense with allusion that sound like they were made up on the spot ir length is key to that illusion and to the albums strength y stretch and tease out bits of interplay between a morse ode keyboard motif a womans soulful mmm-hmmm and a more robotic on occasional 80s video game lasers and other vocal samples over a crisp and dry drum track for instance as on like in order to incrementally load the atmosphere with tension but for all the moodiness on show here theres no sense that glasgow and white are truly gloomy: they keep the arrangements moving around too much for that s more like they find it cathartic and beautiful and can teach even a skeptic to as well
could this be the future of resource pooling in the dance music community audio provide the outlet for a clutch of remixes of s which is being released on another label dj spuns rong music spun and mark blakkat bells mix is a deep 4 am trip into the darkest corners of house with wrecking ball beats that crunch and decay and a paranoid synth line the title of blakspuns dub leaves little to the imagination amid a backdrop of depth charge booms the tension is gradually ratcheted up by a 303s bounce and flutter audio boss erik estornel under his maetrik guise dunks the track in a vat of waspish synths loping beats thunderclaps and crowd-pleasing breakdowns but its the idjut remix that sticks longest in the mind playing more on the crazed esg-style vocals of the original the brit house stalwarts manically switch between tempos flooding it with jingling percussion wild-eyed drum rolls and dabs of out-there acid
the seventh record from is another joint effort between label head anthony parasole and fellow new yorker phil moffa following their atlantic ave ep in late 2012 this one might not be as heavy or harsh (and a change in scenery on the cover art suggests as much) but thats certainly not a problem: the duo still manages to bring the goods bristles with sixteenth-note hi-hats and sharp gritty chords as a reverberating zig-zagging synth line slowly rises to the fore theres an irresistible flair for drama especially with the leap in and out of a throbbing near-silence a thrilling moment punctuated perfectly by a single drawn-out crash is drum-less three-minute cut that nicely emphasizes the up-in-the-sky vibes of the original on the flip is another cleverly sequenced track geared towards adventurous dance floors its thick nerve-racking drones fall away about two-thirds of the way through leaving taut acidic synths to churn and twist for the final few minutes
across its first two releases singapore label made a point of showcasing lesser known artists (eddie niguel ultrademon) alongside their more widely celebrated peers (basic soul unit iron curtis) this approach continues on as saddles up alongside a mass of bulging bass hits and rippling synths is every bit the type of meditative techno weve come to expect from as the track progresses a dark veil tightens around the elements synths become shriller and each kick more ominous with every swollen step is more direct marrying jackhammer drums with a distorted synth line giving it the sheen of classic berghain techno s wont sends wild cosmic synths tumbling over bass heavy breakbeats the result is beautifully disjointed on really flexes his muscles e launches straight into a taught and funky groove as muted 303s play off razor sharp claps this is without a doubt the strongest shift release to date
enoit sergio have always kept pop music at arms length they bury their melodies in weird effects mumble their way through hooks or just square everything on the groove its a formula thats allowed them to keep their feet planted firmly in the house music world but its easy to wonder what if what would they sound like if they really let their christopher cross flags fly their second ep for brings us somewhat closer to the answer still ensconced in a psychedelic blur these three tracks somehow feel less dazed than usual (just listen to the uncharacteristically incisive bassline on ) parsing yacht rock nu-disco and slick 80s pop is the kind of song weve been waiting for enoit sergio to make since full grown man its nonchalant its tantalizingly slow and its utterly deadly guitar licks scratch at supple chord washes as vocal phrases recline lazily over the filtered ooze; its a tropical paradise ut just as youre reveling in the luxury of it all the duo send you reeling into triumphant string samples with the wistful is minced with delirious cheeriness as downcast lyrics ( nooses around my neck ) are thrown at a wall of guitars and hyperactive synths just like their best music its hard to find your footing as youre being assaulted by wave after wave of viscous synth but its harder than ever to care when each of those tracks is meticulously crafted pop magic impossible to make sense of but effective all the same
the brainchild of dean feeney and brothers paul and eddie reynolds walk one heck of a thin line between house and techno: their warm tones and laid-back tempos tug their sound toward the former while hefty rhythms and a minimalist bent push them back toward the latter while the irishmens first record for the odytonic-affiliated the aptly-named it aint hard to tell emphasized their dreamy side their latest for the label contains three chameleon-like tunes as groovy or banging as a dj feels like making them anging though is admittedly the more obvious adjective for s sound this time around chugging along with plenty of surface static the title cut feels like its bound to give way to jazzy rhodes chords and soul-drenched vocals but it doesnt: a twangy voice drops in but never makes it beyond the first syllable or two choosing instead to keep tripping over increasingly hefty and noisy drums the cymbal shimmer that closes out the track sounds like its letting off steam but of thick with 303s and other jackin ephemera keeps the pressure high narrows the groups focus without sacrificing their drive setting a hi-hat over a pitched-up acid loop while a meditative lower bassline lends the arrangement some much-needed gravity

seth troxler has been throwing around the term underground pop describe the labels quirky often melodic dance music s a clunky term vague quixotic possibly useless but s new ep nevertheless indicates the way the label is looking increasingly wards song-craft for inspiration case in point the most curious offering here in which multi-tracks her voice in a massive virtual choir the squelchy funk bass sounds a little like ol e circa we re monster ; the shuffling syncopated groove reminds me a little bit of luciano in his lucien-n-luciano guise ( s palette has an earthier feel however wood and metal instead of glitch and ping ) she sings a slow soft melody almost a lullaby but it feels communal rather than intimate opens with a burst of curiously harmonized voices but its more conventional with a lazy loping house groove and a linear progression or lack of progression really aside from an occasional chord change its arpeggios cycle in place depending upon your mood it might feel mysterious or simply unsure of where go next but on proves that she knows how string out a taut percussive groove that never quits the eps strongest cut its also its trackiest right down drums reminiscent of freaks or swag there are no changes per se no bridge no chorus no middle eight just builds and builds reminds me a little bit of glasser even if they dont actually sound all that alike its something about the richness of the timbres and the heat generated by electronic and acoustic elements when they collide
upon the release of his 50 weapons debut last year jordan rothlein opined that while there is certainly variety in s music it doesnt really have much of a range hes titled his latest ep and while hes still determinedly gloriously techno the four-tracker is keen to show just how much variety you can wring out of infinite shades of gunmetal grey the ep starts inconspicuously with its title track which submerges a queasy drum pattern in swirling radio interference is when things really take off: the earthbound pulse is curiously shaky and the array of sounds that ring around its wobbly core make for one of the most entrancing dettmann tracks since the more particulate days of quicksand meanwhile is like running against a gust of wind at such high speeds youre painfully aware (in a good way) of when every hi-hat hits tuned-in listeners will recognize final track as a cornerstone of fellow berghain resident ben klocks stellar fabric 66 and it sounds every bit as full-bodied on its own its a casual display of dettmanns mastery; basically a single decaying chord repeated ad nauseum the whoosh of hi-hats and snares changes every single bar building pressure to almost uncomfortable levels as with most of dettmans utilitarian slabs of techno theres no real release or climax it might be near to what hes always done but its not even close to tired yet

is the first single from rooklyn duo nick millhiser and lex frankels forthcoming second album dynamics to hear it you might think theyd abandoned the 80s new wave/electro pop feel of their first record for a more punk-funk df sound early listens to dynamics quickly dispel that notion the prominent influences of their debut are still there; is by far the most classically df -sounding thing on it the labels old trademarks pepper the track from a bounding drumbeat and cowbells to a rubbery bassline and multiple vocal-led builds to synth-freakout climaxes it would be foolish to expect something revolutionary from holy ghost thats not what theyre here for but when a familiar template is carried off with this much skill only a churl would complain too bitterly
while you may have never heard of the aseptically-named international records recordings there is a good chance youre familiar with the output of its parent label real records fter seven years of establishing a consistent lo-fi techno sound the real crew have harvested enough release-worthy-but-different material to justify the leap into sub-label territory setting the tone for the sound which according to da will be connected to house/downtempo/electro-acoustic is the galway native dalys premiere continues the tradition he began with releases on his own label feel music: synth-heavy deep house with a space disco flavor introduces itself with a wavering melodic theme reminiscent of jean-michel jarres spacey ambient works eventually a looping funk bassline works its way into the picture accompanied by the usual artillery of disco percussion the synths win the day here however overpowering the dancefloor elements and relegating them firmly to the pocket the end result is a deep groove that would work well at the tail end of a sunrise set on ack daly interweaves elements with enough sonic separation so that the end result gives the listener the impression that theyve stumbled onto a street where car radios and shop p s have all mysteriously fallen into sync with one another clockwork beat pulses alongside a shuffling half-bar bass loop and an ambient pad form the canvas of the track on top of this daly adds snares and claps that take the whole thing back to the 70s ack may lack some of the beef found in but it makes up for it with more intriguing textures
yet another deep house aficionado crawls out of the woodwork to make hay during the current vogue for all things atmospheric and meaningful maybe that said is a spanish dj from madrid and the head of minuendo recordings and if deeptical tracks is anything to go by hes not from the school of contrived beats some people try too hard but i dont get that impression with deeptical tracks seems very natural and without pretense starts off with deep swirling synths over which an effortless drum beat and more interestingly a nicely off-key piano play theres a pacific state feel about the track but one thats bogged down in narcotics dubbyman and s remix is almost catatonic by comparison slowing things down further still to an emotional crawl meanwhile must be one of the most inappropriately named tracks ive come across recently my pet tortoise could get to the beach quicker than this misfit its a sinister wade through waist-high mud towards a tantilisingly close safe haven closing things out layers things nicely a thick bassline with some finger-clicking and a mournful horn slowed down to walking pace may not sound like much but with the addition of some strings it all adds up to perhaps the most dance floor-friendly track on the ep again i feel the hand of super discount on this one its no surprise that artists like patrice scott and jus-ed are releasing some sterling music on spanish labels if this is an example of what homegrown spanish deep house can sound like dubbyman who contributes the remix here is probably the iberian peninsulas current star of the genre but s going to be another one to watch on the strength of this release
used to record post-punk material under the name beautiful people and theyve infused their take on space disco with at times a confrontational attitude (their first singles as come out come down fade out be gone and sleepwalking placed a public mage ltd-esque quality atop their / credentials ) their second album simply titled has more of an electronic shine but they unfortunately dont fully jettison the krautrock-like moods making for a record where two sounds coexist more than fully gel together on for instance scandinavian space cadet lindstr m guest produces and brings a focus lacking from his recent long player the end result is ten minutes of propulsive talo with sharp edges n the same vein goes for percussion-oriented almost tribal vibes not unlike the kind of jams lindstr m records with prins thomas for eskimo until heavily filtered synth pads steal the show next to those you have a barely two-minute long ballad that recalls british shoegazers spiritualized at their most grief-stricken and opiated that songs gorgeous yet somehow misplaced sentimentality quickly vanishes and is replaced by a stoner rock piece la mid-career the verve that even the abstract moog-bound arrangement lurking in the background cant dissipate the albums alleged pi ce de r sistance is made up of the three (albeit quite short) parts of a mini electronic symphony that starts up all sweepingly melodic la johnny jewel but quickly gives in to ebm-like impulses that propels the entire thing to nowhere really specific: the sudden fade-in finale comes across as arbitrary as if the band didnt know how to properly end the tracks wide-eyed sense of build-up is a neat metaphor for as a whole: the music probably sounds huge via live set-ups (with amplification improvisations crowd reactions and all) and you cant help but wonder if the stage is truly where this music will fully come alive and ultimately find its purposes n its studio form though remains a lukewarm ambivalent understatement
is another one of those australian artists causing quite a stir on the worldwide scene following in the steps of infusion phil k vance musgrove and many more his latest single demonstrates the enormous talent coming out of melbourne in particular this release on follows the very impressive debut release by shiloh which of course featured a remix by aussie lads infusion with uk producer gwill morris not to be outdone the 2nd release on this very promising label is just as good on the a-side is the original mix broken beats and swirling effects are layered early in the production as it builds a deep and juicy baseline then enters the track giving it some real substance as it continues to glide along in solid fashion midway into the track the beats are momentarily lost and the vocal samples gain in weight all while the baseline drives the track the track really takes off in the latter half as the melodies and effects combine with the beats while the baseline takes a backseat a solid piece of work from jono on the flip is the fretwell remix another array of solid broken beats spell the arrival of this remix and although the baseline is not as obvious as the original it remains deeply embedded in the production fretwell makes great use of swirling effects and generally creates a great atmosphere with this remix the vocals ride the production without really providing a great presence but overall it s quite a pleasing remix by fretwell hit the mark again with this release so it s a good 2 out of 2 for them both the original and fretwell mix are very impressive so if breaks with a deep baseline and atmospheric edge sounds good to you check this out
many german house producers take inspiration from a wide range of source material especially jazz and hip-hop latter in particular secured a foothold in german youth culture that outlasted its earlier impact in britain take whose work subtly blends horns and jazzy licks with lush deep house on hinters debut for this is markedly apparent on two of the three tracks is a thick slab of mournful house with dabs of piano and a honking sax that could have been snipped from a mid-90s dj premier production its a similar story on although this time the horns are replaced by chimes that are deftly swaddled in a blanket of twinkling dubby house but its the one cut that keeps its distance from hip-hop tropes that makes the biggest impression to a backdrop of orchestral strings it pushes a crisp percussive agenda in which a haunting bubbling melody plays a major role if you like your house music with a touch of fragility then theres much to admire here
the latest long player from kruder dorfmeisters g-stone imprint comes from a long time friend of peter kruder hunters association with kruders traces back to the days of 3rd grade playing in moreaus hip hop band with the likes of kruder and dsl hunter himself has played a big part in viennas dance music scene and has produced music for his label uptight recordings under various guises and for other artists such as leena conquest which culminated in boundaries which was selected for a rebirth of cool compilation kruders always been one to keep g-stone close-knit and so theyve invited hunter to record an album the album gets underway with electric lady and its one for the ladies with its synth heavy funk heavily percussive grooves and vocal arrangements which lean towards the disco styles of the late 70s and mid 80s with that doo be doo doo style work that body is a deeper ride funky bass licks chunky percussive breaks deep vocal samples and funked up horn arrangements laced throughout the track its on a g-stone vibe giving up some of that smokey laidback atmosphere speaking of g-stone richard dorfmeister lends a hand in producing let your soul guide your heart again choc full of percussive breaks whispery vocal samples and a guitar lick that feels like its been lifted from a cult western quero saber takes listeners into a more relaxed mood with deep dubby bass electro synths and features the vocals of orieta pires who tells her story in spanish take a ride brings more latin flavour to the album with flamenco guitars funky horns and fluttering jazzy flute lines courtesy of stoney take a ride part 2 sits on a reggae bounce featuring aladin on vocals gone are the laidback guitars and downtempo beats from part one part 2 takes on a new life with uptempo beats and adopting a wicked bass line hunter brings out even more reggae flavours on find it featuring the deep gutsy vocal talents of farda p hunter increases the tempo for without warning putting a little deep house flavour into the album electro hooks and deep percussive beats let this track sit somewhere in between deep house and nu-jazz while vocalist ken cesar adds soul to the track with his powerful vocals the is a collection of laidback funk grooves mixed in with the smokey tripped out styles many have come to expect from g-stone fans of kruder dorfmeister and the g-stone collective of artists should certainly hunt this one down and it has some cross over appeal to anyone whose interests in music lean towards downtempo beats
you have to w der if the reas techno is so popular right now has to do with the deep alienati felt by many in western capitalist societies where house music has often offered escapism and a reassurance that everything is going to be alright c temporary techno deals in a far more brutal catharsis that seems fitting for the age it simultaneously makes manifest the terror of 21st century existence and offers transcendence from it as much through its unrelenting physical pressure as its brief moments of beauty and release it embodies and erases the dark world around it few producers seem to understand this better than juan rico on this full spectrum outing of two producti aliases reeko and architectural he melds those two modes of techno in a way that is highly evocative and free of clich re is no simple progressi here from the banging to the beatific on kelper for instance is all dubby warmth and shooting star synths but repeatedly disturbed by a heavy clunk that sounds like a pris door shutting or an artillery gun being reloaded a beatless sprawl of surging arcing arpeggiati undermines the usual noti of ambient techno: its waves and cycles grow so dramatically that its exhilarating instead of soothing distincti that rico achieves between individual sounds in these cavernous tunes is remarkable and lends the tracks a cinematic quality with its twisted traffic noise thunderous rolling beat and huge cracks of lightning is as tense and humid as a south asian mega city beneath a gathering storm remarkable audio clarity lifts the thumping into a different realm and ratchets up the poignancy of the dank raime like darktr ica of rico is a producer of rare skill e who completely understands the functi ality and emoti al res ance of techno

/nu-disco/re-edits is a bitch of a scene to be into you listen to beats in space every week plus a bunch of harvey mixes and you hear all these awesome records and then you try to buy them and either it s some limited release from 1983 and it costs 300 on ebay or it s some limited release on whatever we want from 2006 and it still costs 300 on ebay this release from features a darshan jesrani (metro area) mix making it especially collectible the source material throughout is solidly 80s disco but with that thickness and fatness of sound that only seems to come from modern re-edits the darshan track tight is a break-y bass-y effort at around 105 bpm that chugs along in a satisfying manner redolent of a more organic break 4 love but with more bongos however the stand-out here is actually run with a sweetly twang-y bassline and energetic hits giving it a real patrick adams feel which then builds progressively cycling through some heavy afro percussion before hitting a melodic rush around the four minute mark snap it up now because you ll pay through the nose once this hits the second hand market
california producer joshua heath is never afraid to pack his home states sunshine into his tracks his work as (this for bristols futureboogie is his third ep under the name) tends to inject funk and disco influences into the classic house sound that typifies the music under his given name is no exception though the title track is the only one here with a vocal: a warm repetition of the titular phrase which heath wraps in elastic bass hovering pads and tumbling percussion s remix of the title track does pretty much what his remixes always do but it does it well and it will be the main reason to pick up this release stretching well past the ten-minute mark he scatters sundry echoing effects and drums onto a teeth-rattling bass refrain elsewhere a begins with a kompakt-like bed of pads and percussion before taking a more flamboyant turn through slabs of bass and skittering arps digital bonus take your time makes for a low-bpm but high-drama finale its thunderclap drums anchoring waves of buzzing synths and theatrical keys
in 2011 a number of uk labels were operating on s premise now fewer artists make the hybrids of house techno dubstep broken beat and two step that the bristol outpost was set up to showcase some from that era simply lost interest and others just werent very interesting s purpose is to throw artists from polarised rhythmic disciplines (4/4 and dubstep for example) and get them to knock heads in a studio shows that these experiments remain fruitful the erelist and collaboration demonstrates what we already know: their respective genres have been mingling for a while on his remix of s tom ford places a spitting hi hat exactly where youd expect from a techno producer while the marimba notes are allowed a wayward shuffle s remix of returns the favor rather than giving fords paranoid lasers and hoovering reese bassline a simple techno sheen scatters the stems like marbles the two producers successfully explore several facets of each others sound across further breaking down the boundaries between them

it takes quite a pair to name yourself in a pop-culture knee-deep in an 80s revival but matt southall ( ) doesnt even bother to touch any of the other requisites be it neon imagery or aviator shades and were all the better for it s a spymania alum and current mainstay has stitched together a comfortable niche from the remains of glitch-pop his work looks back to the sampled textures of herbert as much as the tension between vocal tics and ticking vocals of super_collider ll the ingredients were in the debut snakeskin teeth a track full of drunken mumbles prickly drums and a fistful of seams made from cut-ups but the crucial part of s sound is how each track stumbles downward how slivers of melody trickle along t risk of hyperbole might be his best single yet theres an urgency to the lead track mostly found in an aggressive billowing mr oizo-ish bassline that changes the tone of s shamble-sample house a nervous buzz underneath is stuffed to the gills with filets of woozy gospel screams and snare fills theres a subtle re-invention here but one that leaves a mumblecore actually sounding unhinged and flailing placed alongside a remix of his previous single whats you hear just how much was tempered by his slower grooves sure the track is an entirely pleasant remake with plenty of stutters and squiggles but it has none of the anxious grit that blesses either lets hope gets lost a little bit longer in that sound
this is the debut release from hotflush label manager jack haighton and is slated to be the first of a quarterly 12-inch series collecting his edits of italo gems vocodered chorus of cyber s vision the source material for opener may sound familiar having been sampled by hacker on fadin away haighton retains its echoing charms in his version but cuts the originals squigglier synth digressions leaving a deep streamlined beast that pivots on its classically chunky and infectious italo bassline (7 is an edit of bands computer monkey that does away with the originals more cheeseball vocal excesses (some monkey impressions and an endearingly ridiculous female vocal/robot duet since you asked) retained are its tumbling bassline and gleaming synth pattern to which haighton adds a more toned-down vocal sample repeating the phrase and the night moves on like the a-side its a pared-down and relatively subtle interpretation of a flamboyant original both cuts succeed on these terms making for a supremely listenable opening installment to a series that should be worth following
not so long ago on the strength of a tweeted recommendation i listened to sasu s 2007 album whistleblower having been more familiar with his recent (harsher more beat-driven) work as vladislay delay this strange album of deep percussive textures was a pleasant surprise there is a lightness that pulses through whistleblower and really all of s work not to say his music cant be challenging but rather that it is more approachable and less punishing than that of the average raster-noton alumnus his experimentation feels like its conducted outside of the sterile laboratory environment sounds like a continuation whistleblower its definitely noisier maybe a little angrier too but the same wonderful ear for sound collage is present the defining trait of both albums is s ability to construct dense textural pieces that appear to have no centre of gravity no single structural element that the rest of the track hangs on you get the sense that the music is generating itself moment-to-moment rather than following a predestined path there is continuity but its intuitive somehow natural but never predictable ton the opening track is perhaps the most ambitious example of this approach to date its 22 minutes long but never loses form or intensity a low buzzing drone sustains it throughout hidden underneath quick-fire chord stabs and flickering static without seeming to move the track develops into a fizzing ball of energy a crescendo that approaches from all angles at once eventually it peaks a snare hit rising in frequency while a sustained piano chord smothered in reverb rushes in underneath its a beautiful moment in a track that revels in dissonance and menace and it goes to heart of what makes such an interesting artist the rest of the album follows a similar formula to its epic opener blending the noisier more aggressive elements with an almost hidden underlying beauty and are a touch more relaxed more traditionally ambient in a way though they still vibrate with nervous momentum is for large stretches softer and prettier than anything else on the record for anyone only familiar with s recent work particularly the frantic material hes been putting out under his own name will be a bit of a curveball its a slow burner extremely committed to a particular emotional atmosphere where anger and frustration rub up against moments of beauty despite its layered nuances and depth of design it still feels organic and terrifically spontaneous finds attuned to a very specific focused energy and the result is some of his best work
its a shame that is so committed to the anonymity of its producers ny beatmaker would be rather happy to attach their name to its releases instead we simply must applaud 19 26 1 18 5 this time around wherever you are good sir (or madam ) your two-tracker follows in the tradition of the label in its slow-developing no-nonsense techno that is unafraid of a chiming melody or two but isnt beholden to it either has a lead-foot breakbeat techno vibe that is garnished with creepy chanting that evokes gregorian monks and a slight shimmy of a two-note melody it moves along at a speed a tad below 120 pm making it ideal warm-up or cool-down fodder is considerably faster but just as atmospheric finding room for the type of globular synth work of ola its certainly not as smooth as the idm mainstay but the contrast between the heavy beat and enchanted space-y meandering in the background makes for listening that is just as satisfying at home as it is to hear on the floor its likely that 19 26 1 18 5 is indeed a different producer than those that have come before on but the quality speaks for itself
though its only a two-track single theres a weight to this is s first solo release since 2011s space only ise the album that propelled him to crossover stardom in the meantime hes scored films started a successful record label and taken the world by storm with his band darkside (which has since disbanded) se projects have been defined by jaars unique ability to find powerful feelings in the most muted moods as well as a tendency to go long both of those traits are even more pronounced on which offers two of the strongest songs hes put his name to everything here feels temporary voices and instruments stretch and warp beyond recognition while other parts distort on impact or just disappear altogether on shes crash-bang drums break a delicate web of sound before jaars vocals lull the storm back to serenity on his voice is a constant presence in the background tying it all together with a simple melody that sounds like something he might have sung absent-mindedly in the shower grandiose yet bedroom-intimate for vaguely resembles a time for s jaars cagey dance floor anthem from a few years back its rarely straightforward but there are striking moments when its potent bassline swelling organs and vocals come together before it all dissipates into a drifting outro as with the best of jaars music is alluring confounding and full of spine-tingling moments
industrial strength techno with just enough detail to keep you on your toes thats been the remit of thus far and it continues here with the second ep from -x whether x is a pseudonym for a well-known producer or simply someone starting out isnt quite clear but the fact that you need to even ponder it points to the quality of the work: clearly this is someone that knows what theyre doing in the studio not far from the faceless track titles of their debut were greeted with side and yet somehow theyre 100 indicative of what youre going to get pitting the hard-edged sound of sonic groove against the droning pulses of prologue its a perfect match especially in which has a sound eerily reminiscent of a man screaming in the distance for a very long time credit the arrangement on this one as the layering is impeccable might be even better if you broke the track open itd look a bit like the original nintendo version of donkey kong steel girders open spaces and lots of scary things coming at you when you least expect it
vainio vigrouxs peau froide l ger soleil ( cold skin light sun in english) is the first recorded evidence of a three-year collaboration while mika vainio might be familiar to many franck vigroux is likely less so hes been an active musician and artist since the 90s but this is only his third full-length release outside of his dautre cordes label originally a guitarist by trade his instrumentation creeps in on the penultimate track here it adds a fresh set of sounds to the record calling to mind a sort of morricone-style loneliness or neil youngs dead soundtrack elsewhere the pairs traditional interests are more comfortably aligned the album consists mostly of aggressive industrial sounds on first listen these more confrontational pieces present an unbroken edifice of rock-solid sound: big thumping kicks propel harsh waves of noise into reckless collisions they can feel static locked in a restricted rhythm straining against their bonds but the details emerge over time layers of carefully synthesised tones separate making the cleverness and precision of their composition clear soon youre listening past the blockbuster moments the first drop on the side-chain pumps at the end of m moire to the smaller sounds rustling in the background perhaps the quietest track here begins with the near-weightless breathing of resonant bell-like tones and slowly fills out with waves of low rumbling noises and odd chords the snippets of vocoder only add to the sense of unease a slight but unshakable feeling of dislocation something is wrong in fact its hard to say whats right everything feels colored by a feeling of paranoia and tense desolation its a rich atmosphere to spend time in and vainio vigroux maintain it perfectly until the last withering note peau froide l ger soleil is a difficult album to get a grip on its length and diversity compounding any attempt to sum it up neatly it draws on the same impulses that have driven vainios career to date: a dedication to intense sound design sound wielded as a weapon and sound as something ambiguous almost comforting but not quite the aggressive tracks are sometimes spectacular on a large soundsystem would be impressively daunting but more often the quieter moments stick in the mind
this time on is a one-sider by entitled think french house with a tougher italian edge and this release is what you have on offer starting with the filtered vocals this release builds slowly enough with some cheeky beats and filtered effects soon enough the vocal gets out of the loop and begins to bring the production in full speed resulting in a house summer anthem that is sure to be a hit also adds a good element to the track with some arpeggiated synths that help the uplifting vibe and give it a hint of a trance edge it s sure to be a big release for mantra with the only downfall being that this is probably an idea that has been heard before i m sure that won t stop it working that s for sure it s a summer anthem in the same vein as so much love to give was but don t be fooled it s a much much much (i can t stress how much) better track then together s god awful repetitive fodder was
a small but well-formed party based between north italy and east berlin expanded to run a record label in december 2014 their debut release was an in-house effort from alex picone and latest comes courtesy of cult australian producer for rip tide he gathers together four rich elegant house tracks produced around the turn of the millennium as its title implies the ep has an aquatic theme and each selection is said to have been recorded in dat between 1998 - 2002 at its best rip tide stands toe-to-toe with jansens best work lush shimmering opener sounds like house music found at the bottom of a pearly ocean while includes faint crashing waves in its tranquil sound palette standout is an intricate utterly charming after-party cut with a baseline that sounds like s-max at his most playful only the slightly busy fails to deliver though it sounds better when pitched down a bit and yet this remains an impressive house record musically complex but imbued with an everyman quality
fter everything weve seen from eric duncan and thomas ullock its hard to imagine the dj duo having a debut anything at this point but the truth is that their combined discography to date has been fuelled by menagerie of aliases and side projects including dr dunks c o m i still going map of frica and laughing light of plenty so finally seeing the rub-n-tug name in the artist slot on this release is remarkable in itself for this occasion like jake and elwood lues theyve put the band back together assembling members of the rub-n-tug family including golf channels justin vandervolgen and the sweeney cousins (spencer and matt) the two tracks on this 12-inch are a live edit and an instrumental of tracks off a forthcoming full-length and if youve been keeping an eye on either duncans edits or ullocks projects for whatever we want records you wont be surprised to learn that they are both rock sleazy blues-based dirty-ass mick keef rock roll to be exact true to its name this live edit of sounds like a hairy jam thats been chopped down can style into a floor-ready freight train that begins with a two-fisted piano vamp over bricklayer drums and winds its way through hills and valleys until a sizzling outro groove featuring cornelius yrd a long-time rub-n-tug party mc who croons rrruubbbb and tug over and over if the -side is the furious partier the -side is the sunday hangover on ll a gorgeously-eerie mellotronish choir provides the spectral sheen on a more contemplative shambolic jam that starts acoustic and grows into a mellow midtempo groover with all the good comedown vibes you could ask for
mark martini pulls on his hollow promise costume and assumes the 3rd release on the young with mark is fast becoming a respected producer and has seen his work grab notable attention from the industry heavyweights chris micali who has released work on bedrock and blueprint of late has been given the call up for remix duties support for comes far and wide including deep dish max graham peter bailey jonathon lisle and mv the original mix is a deep chunk of smooth house with rough edges and powerful basslines the beat drives along with rasping percussive samples stabbing synth chords and echoing vocals the breakdown features pulsating speaker-to-speaker sounds and vocals while dropping in single and double beats as it explodes with full bassline effects and tight percussion there is a great feeling of power and the smooth tranistions throughout really bind this track together great work chris micalis on the road remix goes deeper than the original as it utilises soft percussion gorgeous soundscapes and moody samples a subtle bassline hook with granulating effects gives depth to the mix as the track takes a turn with slow sustained sounds which constantly flow over with vocals closely behind chris has really come through here and the constant feeling of atmosphere and sound leave the mind racing beautiful production both tracks are diverse and will surely meet the needs of house purists who enjoy smooth productions
throughout has been nearly impossible to ignore constantly injecting his releases and his current run of remixes for the likes of simian mobile disco and little oots with his own strain of mutated funk that preys on the roughly textured edges of his basslines as much as it does the lead synths this outing for pinchs label tectonic follows an earlier appearance on the tectonic plates vol 2 compilation and in keeping with the beat that appeared there untitled rsn these tracks tread a tougher path is the obvious follow-up pouring its energy into the tightly wound bassline rather than into the slithering sensuality of some of his synth work on other releases such as digidesign on hyperdub or his work with ginz on tracks like purple colours the bassline and its solid beat structure with twists of mechanoid screaming before the pads blossom and lift the tone away from the force of the bass mid-range is more typically what one has come to expect from the self-proclaimed purveyor of the purple wow sound; big bass stabs pulse in time to a slower hip-hop beat that concentrates heavily on the punch of the snare dding his erratic yet sublimely likeable synth riffs he builds something that perfectly embodies what his productions are all about fusing the elegance and sex of funked-out lead lines with bass pressure and rhythms that will drive a dance in his own typically unique signature style
the cocktail party effect refers to humans ability to pick one sound out a bunch of them which for instance allows us to tune into a conversation at a noisy party you can see why the term resonated with the berlin-based south londoner charlie baldwin whose releases on apollo as kasket have come increasingly to sound like a load of drunk people called things like jazz psych-pop dm and post-burial ambient shouting over each other his new alias focusses on a single conversation namely the one about bass-loving uk producers making techno some of the tracks on his recent helloyello cassette hinted at more exploratory angles for the project but this fairly straight ep for pinchs cold recordings is solid too as is the cold way the sounds are abrasive and the moods subzero all that passes for melody on is a strange high-frequency whimper soon swept away by a bristling formation of kick drums and scrabbling percussion the eps most striking track permits a descending-scale earworm that along with scrambled voices that recall early blawan ducks and weaves between pistoning drums both tracks show fleeting hints of swing and the groove loosens further in the eps other half is rhythmically uk garage though its droning bass and cheesy vocal drops somehow nod to the gabber-hardcore axis featuring deft sidesticks and a thicker low-end snarl does slinky menace better
is a club night thats well placed to take advantage of the on-again off-again love affair between house and disco the brainchild of respected disco producer toby and london scenester danny clark has been bringing heroes of the house scene such as radio slave and jimpster to play alongside disco stalwarts such as bill brewster long before many other parties were inspired to jump aboard the glittery disco bandwagon it should come as no surprise then that the labels first forays into the record business see the release of a slick hybrid of discoid house coming courtesy of french/us producer eschewing the prevalent trend in the disco/re-edits scene of recycling large chunks of 80s rarities and applying house grooves; has produced using only analogue equipment the result is a warm mid-tempo groover thats reminiscent of early 80s prelude material and production touches that are reminiscent of metro areas best work meanwhile slows down the tempo slightly but keeps the funk ever-present staples of 80s boogie such as live bass groovy clavs and triangle rides all feature but are mixed with modern touches like white noise washes and reverbed wood block hits with a laidback vibe but a clearly dance-influenced structure both and are likely to find favour with fans of lindstr m and other producers who have been lazily bracketed together in the cosmic disco section the remixes of although not radically different in style and tone to the original are also undeniably worth a mention the toby mix simply beefs up the drums and extends the bassline to good effect making the record more palatable in a club environment however its the fabrizio mix on this package which makes the most lasting impression following up from his stellar work on labels such as bear funk and tiny sticks continues a run of form that has seen him gain plenty of plaudits from underground disco tastemakers in recent months taking the electro funk influences found in the original mix ramps them up tenfold analogue bass growls patrick cowley-style flicks of cowbell and chicken lips-influenced bleeps make this record perfectly pitched at those who like the more sleazy and electronic side of disco with enough grunt to get dance floors moving but enough groove to keep those attuned to soaring melodies interested should be a welcome addition to any collection that flirts with the more down-tempo areas of club music
you must be saying to yourself why remix a classic why even bother trying to repeat successes from the past when there are new tunes being produced every second well it seemed that canberra local vance musgrove was at it again with another remix for one of electronica finest tracks ever produced: s rain cry you may remember his last remix of danny tenaglia s house classic elements limited has snapped it to its new imprint that caters more left of center sounds and music the release sees only a one-sided outing in the vance musgrove mix on the main-side the first good 30 seconds are devoted to a heavy bass kick that quickly adds in a drum kick with soft production from the original rain cry the track is entirely built around the heavy bass kick to make your booty shake all night long from that b-line the track merges into a classic trance/progressive state of affairs with that first breakdown to calm the track from driving too hard too fast; it catches itself and keeps that nice four to the floor action throughout the track mixed in with rain cry s old school trance melodies and powerful syncs that stirs up blissful memories of late-night barn raves in the countryside the track s good no doubt and it consist of one part for the fist half and then is looped back for the second half what else can you say except that you can t keep classic s down for long nowadays without it being revamped unofficially or even officially now with many labels re-releasing popular and well known tracks as of late s original from the hardkiss stable has been hammered by everyone from sasha to laurent garner john digweed to koma bones vance musgrove has added his ideas into a hard driving mix that still keeps the mood setting of the original not bad at all for a timeless classic that helped defined the modern sounds of electronica in the early hours of the 1990 s
its a pleasure to see john talabots collaboration with axel boman get its first proper release not least because itll hopefully pave the way for plenty more from them soon first appeared on talabots dj-kicks last year a tribute to the late great barcelona dj aleix verg s it overlays a genial chugging bassline with swelling atmospheric touches and a gently squalling key pattern not heard on the dj-kicks mix were the tracks last couple of minutes which include a lovely quasi-ambient interlude that feels like a coda until that bassline sweeps it away again on his extended remix cologne-based englishman matt retains the originals primary ingredients but confers a more linear floor-ready feel with pretty flickering background arps the excellent package finishes with talabot and bomans own bcn version which foregrounds clip-clopping percussion and adds a rumbling breakdown otherwise the mix sticks close to the subtly funky consummately realised original
leeds producer has a curious ear for atmospherics as evidenced by his eps from earlier this year: humid beats that waded through their own manufactured mist ut was the first thing i heard by lfie macgibbon and what endeared me in the first place features the same sparse soundscape of naked metal that defines most of macgibbons current and forthcoming productions as if that soporific spore cloud has been lifted its a bit of an about face from those first releases but certainly a welcome one: half the attraction here comes from the way he lets his slicing percussion billow out into an exactingly constructed echo chamber d transition puts a brittle house pattern smack dab in the middle of the techno void and the result is strikingly lonely a sluggish euphoria on the other hand is all about its razor-thin drums that resonate like knives being sharpened (you wouldnt know that such rigid metallurgy could be so damn groovy ) for macgibbons best work yet though look to the -side: emboldens that surgical steel march with stirring synth grumbles and patchy particulate chords siphoning the warmth from utonomic and funneling it into macgibbons own world its a great start for a new label and another promising entry in the career of a burgeoning producer
before the clatter the fourth album by new yorks weirdo fusionists begins with a quiet voice: i can hear everything its everything time its a description all too on-the-nose for the kind of melting pot experimentalism the b has created over the last nine years melding the sturdier dance textures of grime house trance with north african music astral jazz ambience middle eastern timbres have honed their what-the-fuck aural mesmerism to the point where from 2005s gods money to 2008s excellent saint dymphna they began to sound well almost like the kind of bizarre music your eccentric hippie aunt might come to like it wasnt increasingly poppy per se; it just felt more linear lived-in following the critical success of saint dymphna comes the b s debut on with the b s long time producer chris coady back on board continues confidently in the increasingly melodic song-oriented arc theyve been tracing since gods money the collage of sonic touchstones spatters of sounds from various corners of the world are still stitched into these very physical songs but the b s ever more reliant now on dance patterns the purple synths currently beloved by so many uk bass music producers in turn their use of lead singer lizzi bougatsos begins to feel more incidental as though her voice is merely another element rather than its anchor (though admittedly there will always be those irritated enough by her urban bansheeing to ignore ggd completely) like the rest of their output s intended for whole-set consumption not track favoritism; theirs is rhythmic journey music both in its heady drifts its heated assaults its intended to be swallowed in one 48 minute gulp eleven-minute opener for instance simmers on dark side of the moon synth patterns for a couple of minutes before splitting into a swirling house jam propelled by new drummer jesse lees heavy charge flirts with digital reggae as it opens until its balearic-leaning bass submerges it into deeper breezier territory with its ravey synths broke-hip strut lead single is the records most tumultuous anthem while finds ggd reclining into a fuzzy contemplative groove that resembles kate bush at her haziest but s most surprising perhaps most arresting moment arrives in the woozy lovestoned r b of with hot chips alexis taylor singing alongside bougatsos the b crafts what may be an ode to the softer side of early 80s funk or maybe a playful wink at the same depending on your read regardless of the b s intent though its a damn persuasive rendition of the sound one of the albums true stepback creations for a b thats spent so many years stuffing numberless genres ethnic music nods into their sound its to their credit that theyre still able to astonish us once in a while
the detroit sound in electronic music as most should know by now is no sound at all s ep is further proof luke is the label manager of carl craigs planet e and he just started his own imprint last autumn this ep was the first release and after an extended run as vinyl-only eight months its now open to the digital market acting as lukes nod to tradition and the demands of the modern marketplace the two sides of this ep do this as well they sound like they could technically speaking have been made in 1990 the pads detune and warble and each of the instruments occupies its own space ut they each have a clear identity that you might not expect to hear in this kind of thing at least not today is dank spacious and blackly futuristic it has more than a few signatures of early utechre including the way the kicks handclaps and other fragments flit around its periphery and shares its primitive production aesthetic but thats pretty much it its a big room melodic excursion that might have come from the late 90s more rigidly laid out than typical detroit techno its not until the chords come in halfway through that youre reminded of exactly where this came from

bias freund is a man with a past steeped equally in experimental music as it is in house: see nsi and his recent r podcast for the experimental side and his excellent releases under the name of bias for house so when he teams up with ricardo villalobos who is not exactly known for making big room anthems himself you know that the music they produce is going to come down on the side of the strange bears out this observation: what freund and villalobos serve up here is two sides of musique concr te techno on the -side a four by four kick is the only nod to convention unidentifiable sounds rage over a bare percussive groove and it really does recall european serialism rather than anything to do with dance music the b-side dispenses with any recognisable club pattern at all the drums jerk away under a steadily modulated vocal sample as a simple synthesiser pattern runs on its a testament to both musicians that even though this is some extremely odd music it somehow manages to be catchy the creepy vocals were stuck in my head for days neither of these cuts are likely to be dropped at your local club but if you can spend time unraveling the dense layers of sound in this release you will find it ultimately rewarding
s roots as a dj in berlin clubs like tresor and e-werk in the early 90s are well documented but the link between her djing and her music on the label shes run since 1999 has grown more distant in recent years lism her last album was an adaptation of a soundtrack for a dance performance in pariss centre pompidou the album before that dust was a techno record with conspicuous pop elements but its those formative dance floor spaces from which a nine-track album of some of the straightest techno shes ever made seems to draw is a creepy opener with a man-machine vocal delivering what sounds like a warning: this is not a mind trip / its a mind journey is even more foreboding a hiss-laden techno track with vocal echoes and iron chords the rest of carries on in the same manner the introspective passages or digressions into other styles that defined her past albums are conspicuously absent the album title is a nod to nostalgia a throwback to the kind of pre-commercialised dance music scene from which she emerged in keeping with that a lot of s tracks forego tricky drops and elaborate layers in favour of simpler classic-sounding 90s techno it can sometimes feel a bit uniform the combinations of acid chords and vocal accents on and for example vary only in a superficial sense but s no-nonsense approach sometimes works wonders the two-note synths on one of the albums standouts sounds like a fire alarm and the tracks bassy chords and raspy bassline convey the same urgency alliens vocals on comprised mostly of one-word chants and delivered in english are most effective on tracks like where they feel more like commands than suggestions in returning to the sort of music with which she made a name for herself allien sounds as confident if not quite as ambitious as ever

jarkis music playfully dissects a corpus of 90s dance styles among them breakbeat hardcore the style is often present in his tracks whether in an implied way giving them a manic giddy energy or directly as on the breakbeat-heavy fresh jive the debut release on the label jarki co-runs goes back to the source picking out a hardcore gem from 1992 you can see why x-statics appeals to the icelander like his own music its hooky and bold enough to work in a range of contexts without skimping on weirdness theres a devilish glint in its eye thanks to the frantic gumdrop bassline and the way spooky melodies cast the loved-up diva vocal in a sinister light nobody was clamouring for the track to be reissued but its now bound to find an admiring new audience surprisingly jarkis version is less of a crowd-pleaser he reduces the tracks cascade of sonic novelty to a measured trickle of vocals and spooky chords while the breakbeats sound more desultory and the arrangement emptier the whole thing loops irregularly as if were trapped in a bleary bad dream of the original with no escape in sight
theres a group of italian artists who are currently looking more to the uks ongoing industrial revivalism than their own countrys long tradition of deep techno many of them are linked to repitch a noisy rlin-based label headed up by shapenoise ascion and d carbone an associate of the trio who is based in italy has launched an imprint called which hes inaugurated with the second 12-inch of his career (following patterns on repitch in 2013) if the three tracks on modern passitivity are anything to go buy the italians sound hasnt softened since he debuted two years ago its nevertheless still a niche one and it sits at the workmanlike end of the noisy techno spectrum modern passitivity is jarring and abrasive but you could still almost call it a minimal very few elements are used in each track setting it apart from most music in the same sphere the 12-inchs three cuts and are essentially loops giving them a dizzying quality that eludes most techno of this intensity all feature the same main ingredients: big bass notes and rolling synth snippets it was more or less the same story on s first piece of wax so heres hoping he broadens his palette on his next endeavour
wait a second perc on df james murphys label has spent the past decade or so releasing lots of things: indie dance electro crazy synth epics house but never the kind of brutal industrial-indebted techno li wells makes perhaps not but last year it did give us a record from london three-piece a trio whose cacophonous music has sometimes been referred to as post-industrial for remixing it fits perc like a glove whoever dreamt up the pairing deserves a good pat on the back nd thats without mentioning the second even more notable remixer richard former member of seminal industrial band cabaret voltaire perc has an enviable commitment to making every one of his singles and remixes sound different doing over the throbbing intensity of this has resulted in three versions the first sees kicks and overdriven bass seamlessly welded to the originals spasming synth line this cleverly keeps the tracks identity intact yet transforms it into a storming shard of techno one sharpened by a vocal-less dub mix in contrast the mix is beatless but possibly more enthralling like a sun-lit sandstorm its both bright warm and incredibly harsh key to its elemental power is percs characteristic use of texture grainy static rubbing at the edges of the originals nymph-like vocals then theres s remix built on a siren-like pulse and euphoric chords it almost sounds like a throwback to big beat but dont let that turn you off the originals unexcludable motif continues to throb away at the heart of the action the other elements balanced atop in understated fashion its a nice contrast to percs harsher efforts giving a rounded and distinctive finish
forward strategy group offshoot retail leisure promises a stripped back version of the industrial-strength techno that has typified the collectives efforts thus far r ls debut is just that: sparse techno that does little to announce itself but somehow offers tracks that are just as unsettling as its parent label credit is due to smear it seems who takes on the r l moniker and unlocks the horror that was apparently hiding in plain sight in sleeparchives bleepy techno the murky voices that join about four minutes in is key as well as the clean drone that gets louder and louder as time goes on those bleeps do little more than chug along with only minor variation before almost fading out completely by the tracks end has those bleeps sounding a bit like theyre stuck on an lexander calder mobile twittering around the stereo field as the beat breaks into something that might be dubstep-compatible if it werent so odd lso on the flip is drian augment of like smears efforts here it sounds at first a little bit like a dj tool but the longer you listen the more it seems worthy of play all by its lonesome claustrophobic and queasy it may just be the scariest thing on this dark 12-inch
s records often feature an ambient track or two his best and the beloved ukrainian has hit some dizzying heights ditch his dance tracks post-mills funk but keep the wonky spiralling hypnosis or else they go for sonic overload supplying transcendental moments for spun-out dance floors is one track on this non-dance ep for that falls in the latter camp the opener which is as blearily euphoric as the name suggests from there tolkachev settles into a scratchy exploratory style each track a grizzled synth pattern spun into elliptical loops where his techno can be effortlessly experimental these tracks feel self-consciously difficult and not his best their success mostly depends on their intensity thunders nicely through its oily splats and splutters periodically turning molten is made of similar stuff though its string of eardrum-scraping ideas follow an odd disjointed logic is the eps most intriguing could-have-been its roiling syncopations begging to be transformed into a broken-beat techno monster the energy dips further at the eps tail-end and feature a single loop not so much rhythmic as repetitious drenched in sheets of noise both sound static and lifeless as if tolkachev left his setup running while making a cup of tea the seething mulch of e meanwhile sounds like a downtempo track fractured into a million tiny shards its nice to hear tolkachev pull his music apart but the real trick will be when he puts it back together again
canadian producer s frosted tea ep is the second release to come from new australian tech-house label which promises to deliver all of its upcoming releases online digitally a newcomer to the dj and production world alj s debut ep release represents a four track snapshot of his minimal yet streamlined explorations into deep tech-house opening track march slowly enters on lush bass pads a taut tech-house kickdrum and clicking snares locking in around a background of ambient chords and cut up fragments of human voice before suddenly fading away in a wash of bleeps funeste injects some interesting almost tribal-house influenced percussive sounds over a distant buzzing synth bassline that almost calls to mind a far more blurred-out subliminal version of one of basement jaxx s hooligan anthems before ketouak kicks in with a tight punchy kickdrum and machine-like bleeps and whirs some minimal synth chords moving around in the background offsetting the crisp foreground beats nicely and adding a somewhat hypnotic quality overall finally neige closes this ep with an interesting almost breakstep shuffle to its crisp tech-house rhythms swooshing sounds flying through a dense mesh of mechanical snares and what almost sounds like a chamber being loaded the frosted tea ep offers a nice introduction to s minimal tech-house productions and from the evidence contained within it s obvious that this emerging canadian producer has struck a nice balance between lush yet minimal chord textures and more hard tech-house rhythms lending a nice filmic quality to many of these tracks my only criticism would be perhaps that on a couple of these tracks ( funeste and neige ) the extended beatless breakdowns in the middle bottom things out a bit too much and halt the rhythm mid-sentence apart from these minor points though this is a well-produced and intriguing debut ep that is sure to appeal to fans of minimal tech-house in the vein of luomo and force tracks

with no social media presence and no info on discogs all we know about is that its a new label focussing on deeper house cuts from around the world the man behind s first release isnt quite as low-key: hes a chilean-born stockholm-based house producer who judging from these four super-soulful tracks has talent to spare according to santis a t d l d joint is an abbreviation for ta det lugnt daa which roughly translates from swedish as take it easy yeah if the eps title was meant to reflect its contents then santis has it spot on for those new to his work encapsulates what hes about: it matches skating snares stirring soul vocals and soaring strings with a leisurely beat in the wrong hands this kind of bustling palette could feel fussy but santiss constant tinkering keeps you locked lulus leans a little heavier on the kicks its gently rocking groove strewn with elegant keys the eps most club-ready moment swaps keys for trancey flourishes and a slick motorized bassline on santis closes the ep with a 104 bpm cut filled with lush chords solemn strings and bleary-eyed melody it brings this beautifully detailed release to a quietly epic finish
is supposedly a group from berlin that williams and the rest of the crew doesnt know much about at all its pretty easy to fill in the blanks of their history though given grew up listening to tangerine dream mind(s) blown by giorgio moroder thankful that the balearic revival is in full swing its a simple math equation but one that holds up under the 15-minute epic that hogs the a-side of this release going through every arpeggiator wringing every bit of beatless drama out of its intro and bringing things back from the brink of cheesiness time and time again depending on your tolerance for such things may get on your nerves a bit but its hard not to appreciate the ambition either way a multi-movement quarter-of-an-hour single as your debut release the only issue is that for such a long song it doesnt go anywhere all that interesting the group runs the main theme through its paces adding electric guitar licks here and acoustic color there but youre left with the feeling that in the hands of a better arranger that the tracks obviously purposeful progression would have been streamlined and improved if you didnt hear it in the original youll immediately understand why williams jumped on the chance to release this track in his remix: it sounds like the long lost cousin to his 2008 cover of tangerine dreams love on a real train soft 4/4 bounce thin steel drum-esque synth acoustic strum and all im personally more fascinated by his theme which jettisons the beat altogether for a supple synth throb over the course of its four minutes its an ambient djs dream tool and its simplistic aims and subsequent success make it the best thing here
listening to s recent output with its haphazard arrangements and ever-present fog of delay its difficult to suppress a nagging question: is her sound the result of a carefully cultivated aesthetic or of laziness it hasnt always been this way when estonian maria juur emerged with the tallinn at dawn cassette in 2011 her brand of heavy-lidded psychedelic pop was one of the most appealing things on the not not fun roster but subsequent releases increasingly fell somewhere between upbeat bedroom synth pop and retro disco karaoke where the results had been seductive now they too often felt obnoxious or simply half-arsed its with trepidation then that we approach the bless ep juurs first release for not not fun sub-label 100 silk since 2011 put simply these four tracks are very much in the vein of juurs past releases delay-drenched vocals over tinny percussion and will doubtless provoke the same questions still at points she pulls it off reprises a familiar juur theme of desire as dark compulsion and while the pop framing is trite you sense willfully so theres an unwholesome quality to it that gets under the skin the downtempo feels pretty aimless at first but the jarringly off-key chords in the chorus give it a similar sickly appeal elsewhere though juurs deadpan aimless vocals let her down and the attendant barrage of delay proves fatiguing of is particularly tiresome in this regard is a rare moment of dryness juurs multi-tracked vocals forming a groggy off-key choir but a chunk of george carlins a modern man monologue dropped carelessly over the breakdown breaks the spell finally lady tronica reframes as hazy deep house an odd complement to juurs originals but probably the most digestible thing here
of the livity sound roster s music feels drawn in the finest lines and palest shades his serra ep released in february on his own label offered some new insight into those slender silhouettes the first track was an angular banger that felt like an update on 2013s velez ; the other three were panoramic ambient pieces that sounded like malfunctioning new age records water fell insects flew and birds sang but in broken tape-mangled patterns explores sound design with similar enthusiasm but this time s efforts are a bit more ambitious folds and scrunches similar sounds into stuttering electronics that glow like an old untuned tv on a tannoy announcement bounces inside a cracked glass shell s sounds are so fine that they nearly slip past you but the metallic choral tone of is quietly spellbinding is more recognisably : a rolling polyrhythmic techno/bass hybrid moulded in the livity tradition
a few years ago aka andrew bowen and dimitri poumplidis were among a cohort of uk artists making whats commonly referred to as industrial techno an unforgiving lash of distorted kick drums harsh frequencies and battered factory metals its a style of dance music still doing the rounds karenn and paula temple for example still play regularly but a number of acts in that orbit have either disbanded ( blacknecks ) or faded from view (mpia3 aka truss) s second album on the other hand ventures into fresh extremes is a long hard trudge along the windswept ridge where techno meets noise and industrial the vocals are shrouded by howling feedback and distortion the drums brittle and erratic fall like rocks from a landslide there are no surgeon-style swingers of say their last lp the outer-space themed cosmic microwave background the track titles hint as to why: and all point to the turbulent times when the surroundings change your taste will change poumplidis told the quietus in 2014 three years on is a grim view of the world they now find themselves in beginning with the gerhard richter-style artwork on the sleeve presents its themes in abstract ways features the first of several intercom vocals sunk in mossy static is it speech or white noise sounds like a subway commute from hell which might gesture to everyday pressures if theres a point being made though its rarely clear is stress relief not social commentary as the album enters its second half the rhythms assert themselves a breakbeat thrash on metal dustbin lids begins a sequence that runs through distortion-scarred techno ( ) drum bass dystopia ( ) and gabber-tempo gales ( ) theres a vague suggestion here of pushing back against authority but its more likely that were accelerating on a ramp to oblivion s appeal depends on your threshold for intensity there are deep nods to dominick fernow samuel kerridge and justin broadrick especially in the lps opening half adopt these ideas with style and imagination adding steel-capped techno drum bass and idm beats with the crusty hard-bitten mood thats long defined what they do but their taste for thrills comes at a slight cost skimps on the slippery energising grooves of 12-inches like ard core krew and psychoanalysis shapes the tail-end of the lp in particular ( ) can feel like a grind to get through though is one of the lps most promising middle grounds between old and new around a beat made of bashed steel and slurred vocals a bass-and-bleep rhythm begins to congeal sometime later theres a fiery stereo-filling crackle its angry and torrid and yet as the bassline takes hold the discomfort begins to slide away in moments like these the albums rage is both expressive and constructive not just as a reaction to ignorance and malice but as a drill to relieve pressure on the psyche theyre not going harder and harder and harder as poumplidis once put it but deeper and deeper and deeper
s latest record comes through developers label (developer remixed mulero a few months ago for the latters warm up recordings) while is not as potent as the spaniards excellent accelerometer operator principle ep on semantica earlier in the year it remains a cut above much of todays faceless tough-techno fodder fans of mulero should quickly recognize the tools of his trade rolling mid-range heft gritty trebles charged atmospheres used in and my pick is the title track which goes longer and just a bit deeper augmenting is a remix from truncate aka audio injection aka david flores lately flores seems to be turning more to truncate and to me its clear the alias has over the past year or two yielded stronger stuff he strips things down with his remix creating a leaner more versatile track sleeparchive finishes the ep with his take on while i was disappointed with sleeparchives ep for tresor a few months ago here he continues a long run as a reliable remixer slightly slower and certainly chunkier than the source material (although ending more abruptly) this version will require some quick hands to get it working right in the mix
though - has released a smattering of limited-run cassettes cd-rs and vinyl over the last eight years its in concert that technoise pioneer valerie martino has made her bones like a high school glamour girl who also happens to be the class bully the new englander cuts a figure that is both alluring and imposing hunched over a heap of tangled electronics with desperately seeking susan -style locks swinging across her face she unleashes basement-party tracks that conflate electro and acid confection with harsh-noise belligerence the result is an experience that is fabulous and sassy yet utterly pulverizing weird universe is martinos first widely available release and it successfully bottles the raucous joys of her live show it also manages to sound unlike anything shes recorded before while her core approach remains the same shes torn out much of the ornamentation gone are the dubby cheerleader vocals and lisa frank-flavored adorability of her 2011 split 12-inch with container all that remains are malfunctioning air-raid sirens crunchy-ass handclaps and low-end that rumbles like a fleet of monster trucks and are the records go-to bruisers their maximalist pummel belies her roots in rhode islands famed underground rock scene (which has always placed emphasis on truly colossal beats) equally forceful is here martino cranks up the tempo morphing the nearly eight-minute bopper from video-game bleepage into blurry and buzzing acid mania but weird universe isnt solely about what has been subtracted; theres evidence of cross-pollination here too several cuts find martino grafting her grooves to minimal-synthesizer work that feels inspired by her labelmates (folks like driphouse three legged race and outer space) still trades in bottom-heaviness yet its haunted cascades and melodic lead (which sounds not unlike a theremin imitating bagpipes) give it a hint of the sublime something similar can be said of over a slinky discoid gait (one that calls to mind italians do it better) martino builds a pitter-patter of synth tones thats as off-kilter as it is mesmerizing along with frak mat brinkman viki and mammal martino should rightly be hailed as one of the chief architects of technoise but as weird universe clearly demonstrates she is far more concerned with penetrating the unknown than simply falling back on her reputation
enlist the talents of for their first release of a name familiar to many having been the man behind such projects as casa flava casa bulga and sonic riders to name only a few his ultra smooth productions have gained him a weighty reputation over time with some serious tracks and this is no different as features the seductive vocals of snajanka nancheva the original mix layers neatly from the start with a groovin percussive roll setting the pace as a tougher beat is then added followed in succession by the emotive vocal while this is gathering momentum bright chords and bassline add to a feel good enchanting factor that takes place the more the vocal develops at the break proceedings wind down to a mystical serenity with the vocal taking centre stage before winding back up ever so gradually nanchevas vocals make the track which overall is reminisent of the massive east to west from osiris its subtly emotive hypnotic and quite refreshing flip it over and were treated to the deeper mix does what it says on the tin shifting the mood a little off centre with the addition of lush strings deeper bassline and focusing on working in a few more twinkling melodies complimenting the vocals while gathering at a slower pace pure sweet as honey progressive from kolev

s new is a complex construction; its a 19 track journey through 35 years of electronic music a massive undertaking in itself arranged across four 12 inch picture discs according to a color visualization of the genre and the length of the individual track weve got acid (forest green) electro (purple) house (pink) and techno (orange) organized by speed and tempo each track was meticulously crafted to suit the vinyl medium each color strip is as wide as the track is long with over a decade of experience as a producer brunn proves his knowledge about the complexities of each style recalls the thumping techno and and detroit house he absorbed as a teenager at the voxxx club in chemnitz is gentle and meandering in accordance with brian enos theory that ambient music should be as ignorable as it is interesting andy warhol says yes and no on loop in defiance of an interviewers unimaginative questions on surveys the mind bending sounds that emerged with warps landmark artificial intelligence series and continue to influence beatmakers worldwide design is also a huge part of why this project is so compelling created by german firm korefe the same people who produced the worlds first edible cookbook the package comes with a stunning 13 page booklet containing a handy colour chart a neat interview with brunn about his early experiments and theory of techno as both a tool and a toy and blurbs explaining each track (genre tempo how it was made) even for those less geeky about production color tracks is still a fascinating audio visual trip through the vast expanses of electronic music
if youve been following the halftime trend (thats a very loose term for the m lange of drum bass jungle hip-hop and footwork thats filtered through the bass scene in recent years) youll likely know about ivy lab and their label last november that trio of critical-affiliated producers sabre stray and halogenix launched the new project to release their first halftime mixtape called 20/20 volume one it was mostly a grim and nihilistic affair all cold sounds and shiny metal surfaces with few traces of human life there was none of ivy labs fluffy-cloud drum bass just bleak battle-ready broken beats has since signed artists like deft and to present their version of the micro-genre on his ep the latter producer a classically trained percussionist revels in the kind of bass perversions producers are free to make in the world of halftime and his tracks are pretty distinct for instance sounds like a bee hive trying to communicate with us while the title track delivers one of the most subversive and catchy drops of the year nails a big bassy swagger lastly is as it says the eps most straight-up hip-hop track and it fully delivers on that front
this next release on follows the very solid release by alexkid unfortunately by doesn t quite set the standard set by previous releases well i don t know what quite to say about the extended live mix of it s almost like a rock song gone wrong i think it may be one of those records that you either love or hate and i probably have to guess that almost 4 in 5 people will dislike it the vocal s sound somewhat amateurish the beats are not too bad the guitar riffs don t do it for me though is this french rock who knows on the flip is the wannabe lost on the forbidden planet mix of itwfm and thankfully this production saves an awful a-side ruining this release deep and dark the beats are chunky and pounding the vocals are thankfully not as strong and awful as the a-side and they really don t do much or harm the track very neutral vocals except towards the end where they are a little cheesy but thankfully the musical elements are good enough to not take notice of the vocals well as i said if it wasn t for the b-side this release not even worth mentioning the b-side while not amazing is good enough to make this a somewhat worthwhile listen but for your own sake please skip the a-side
last years tender leaves showcased the ever-surprising at his most expansive it meandered between herbie hancock funk uk garage and the crackly disco hes made his own over the last four years hes never been one to restrict his creativity although on eps hes tended to exercise greater restraint this debut on his first release since tender leaves sees him ploughing a more floor-focused furrow lead cut is sepia-tinted its drums flaking rust on every stomp with an achingly gorgeous flute line winding above them its a track drenched in nostalgia the aural equivalent of finding a high-school photo at the back of a drawer in comparison osselle is anxiety inducing: drums vocal snippets and synth stabs each claim a brief moment of clarity before diffusing back into chaos things round out with the sleepy stride of whose kicks stumble across twirling chimes with enough bass to leave a bruise the rhythmic switch-up at the half is a deft move like watching a drunk skip suddenly into a fred astaire shimmy the lo-fi house pool may be full to bursting but few producers can make such sparse elements resonate with this much emotional clout
j and terest can be found in the grubbier part of the dance music firmament having orbited a constellation of labels including l i e s black opal and itals lovers rock appearing together on a record for the first time they manage to shine brighter than either has on their own y also deviate slightly from their usual styles landing on a raddled vaguely retro house sound pairs foggy atmospheres broad swing settings and blissful moods have plenty of precedents from anthony naples to parts of the mood hut roster but with the exception of pois unremarkable each of these tracks distinguishes itself j s is the highlight res probably a sample loop too many in there but as each threadbare sound is tossed onto the pile the jubilant mood somehow grows rather than disappearing in the chaos his muscles in on the breakbeat house racket run by the likes of plo man its payoff is delivered by tart chord stabs that bounce and sizzle in the latter half tracks only flaw is its brevity: those loose limbed drums could happily boom along for another couple of minutes on of terests side s clattering drums couldve been lifted from feelings by local artist though the stuff on top a sprightly acid line gorgeous scudding organs takes it somewhere fresh as with the rest of the ep the track throngs with material as if the producer didnt quite have the heart to edit it all down this instance too many ideas turned out to be just the right amount
side from sound of music itself maybe biggest thing that sets l i e s apart from o r electronic labels is its fuck you attitude its records often have a nihilistic tone that echoes 80s punk and new york no wave more than most club music this has never been more true than on its latest two s both incendiary debut releases from uk-born san francisco-based artist oliver ron morelli scrappy individual who runs l i e s out of brooklyn nicely captures mood of se records in ir press blurbs which he writes himself is designed to rip listener apart like a sickened animal on loose is nitzer ebb meets techno meets your face in a meat grinder that will sound pretty unappealing to most people but n re are those of us who read that sort of thing and think fuck yes for anyone in that second group delivers is more brutal of two and both fade in to scenes of total mayhem: drums are searing synth melodies have dark and frantic energy of death metal riffs is post- ra r than mid-apocalyptic with a funkier beat and a mood thats ominous instead of outright horrifying is a club record by comparison albeit one with plenty of gall the is slightly less bleak than it sounds thanks to a dusty jacking drum track and take a similar approach: tortured-sounding but basically club-friendly not for faint of heart but pretty killer for rest of us
copenhagens tartelet has been consistently pushing experimental strains of house since arriving in 2008 so the recruitment of offbeat teenage producer isnt a surprise through his tracks on his own box us holz and ongoing involvement with melbourne cast the 19 year old berliner has shown a preference for raw edged organic sounds maintaining this style the title track a collaboration with tartelets label manager emil margetli and mathias meste o swirls an assortment of honeyed croons around clap heavy detroit jazz making for the eps standout track s studio partner features on an even deeper excursion into percussively fractured melodic electronica the less successful sounds akin to west londons future jazz movement of the early 00s
having got his start as a sound collagist making abstract cassettes lubomir grzelak has a way with samples and field recordings the dance music he releases as is built around them everything from distant birdsong and trickling water to snippets of rap music sesame street and enya his second ep for might be his most straightforward batch of house tracks yet but the bevy of recordings theyre laced with are as warped and disparate as ever between the title tracks oddly catchy screams and the record scratches in the swaggering grzelak delivers four unpredictable dance floor oddities there are hints of korn l kov cs or even gold pandas dancey electronica in but the music is never so jokey or cute john roberts could also be a good reference even if grzelaks lo-fi sources are more lighthearted shit was so deep goes the sample in which sounds both sarcastic and sincere amidst the big percussive beat and tangle of glowing melody crunchy and hard-stomping grooves and hiccups through an airy atmosphere of birds smeared synths muffled vocals and subtle percussion its heavy filter doesnt let up but when the air clears to let a verbose sax solo take over it feels like a stand-in for the cathartic release that never comes grzelak doesnt seem interested in such moments though which is probably for the best has more than enough wonky goodness to chew on
welcome a new production face to their roster in a 22 year old producer who is set to make his mark with this two track release on the london based label already seeing support from the likes of steve smart (kiss 100) as well as nick warren this release looks set to begin the new year for on a good foot first up on the a-side is dub sonar a track that makes good use of some 4/4 beat patterns sewn in with some solid breakbeat a nice heavy baseline rings underneath the track for the duration giving it a solid big room groove all while melodic patterns duck and weave throughout its length it s a quality late set track this with enough substance to work some magic distorted reality on the flip has a little subtle acid feel to it which works well with the vocal that has a similar feel to it as void s classic production orcana deep rumbling baselines churn along for the most part making this another heave progressive number while also bringing in a 90 s progressive touch twisted trippy and mind distorting is the way with this production this is a pretty good release for following an excellent outing by turkish producer yunus guvenen under his indigo child alias based on this release we can expect to hear more from in the not too distant future
located on the island of ibiza in the province of san antonio de portmany and was opened on 20 june 1980 well known architect lluis guell was entrusted with the design of this cafe situated at the edge of the ocean visited by personalities from culture intellectuals and bohemians the reason was its stunning sunsets which are arguably one of the most unbelievable on the planet accompanied by music different from what we are accustomed to hearing coming from ibiza such as the many nightclubs and dance venues it was the music combined with the sunset which gave infamy to this now renowned place called in 94 the english label react released the first cafe del mar cd volume once has style and panache the cafe del mar series has proven a class of its own over the years essentially its a chill out compilation the long drawn-out nature of this cd should be enjoyed by all te karanga by artists rhian sheenan includes sweeping drawn-out background sounds acoustic and electric guitar licks and nature samples of birds hanging out in the background this is blended with soothing female vocals and pan flute melodies invisible produced by m-seven is on a similar tip with orchestral-synth background layered over chilled break beats and piano keys ludvig and stelar slow the tempo with signal (ambient mix) this track has a whaling saxophone intro into down tempo beats waters in motion relies on an emotional piano melody to keep the track moving rather than any percussion at all cette planete by artists jp juice has a quirkier arrangement of sounds layered over a hollow flanged-out beat bleeps and breaks add some ambience to this track as well the ears prick up with under the sea from digby jones which was one of the standouts for me piano keys seamed together with organic pan flute sounds lush and lucid this is layered over a subtle but groovy baseline with chilled beats that gives this track a loungeier feel simple although very effective all the tracks on this compilation are of a down tempo nature volume once is a very smooth and melodious collection of tunes all the tracks are rich with tranquillity and serenity it is most probably marketed for a retired more mature audience who are in search of that laidback relaxed vibe over all does volume one has some good tunes on it its a first-class collection of high quality ambient music the finesse of the compilations is not to be questioned the cover art adds flavour to volume once a picture of budda that is hand drawn by a japanese man who came to live in ibiza hundreds of years ago there is a nice little story to accompany the cover art which is included on the insert and is a good read all up its a pleasant experience as they say was born to put music to the sunsets track list 01 rhian sheenan te karanga 02 m-seven invisible 03 ludvig stelar signal (ambient mix) 04 jens gad art nouveau 05 ohm g bruno in slide 06 adani wolf featuring praful where would i be (memoria vermelha mix) 07 sonic adventure project waters in motion 08 miro holding up 09 rue du soleil eston
my main ambition is to change peoples perception of [grime] and to show that its not just one dimensional as you might have guessed from this 2012 quote boss mr mitch is getting along just fine with grimes current diversification mitch is one quarter of the boxed gang but his label has been pushing interesting instrumental grime for several years now (blooms 2012 stormer quartz was probably the labels biggest coup) its latest release mirrors mitchs own recent the room where i belong ep much of which treated grime not as a close-minded formula but as a springboard from which to explore melancholic synth music of various forms the producer is adelaides who while no stranger to thornier grime gestures often uses tender synthetic textures that wouldnt sound out of place on a vaporwave release rabit and logos have done things this sparse and visionist has been equally melancholic but none of them have reached such heights of unashamed romanticism could almost be some heartbreaking david sylvian tune at its opening; only a sprinkling of blip-blip percussion reminds us what century were in (well that and the square wave that delicately pirouettes into view) things get a touch confused as the intensity builds but reins it in before the close works with similar materials; its melody bears traces of ruff sqwads boisterous sentimentality but its half-shrouded in reverb the sorrow glands arent squeezed quite as tight here as they are on the a but its still a pretty captivating statement from a young producer with bucketloads of promise
veteran of londons pirate radio scene and the nti social entertainment crew s debut of last year rena 1 hinted at his musicality; the lush ambient synths of the title track were closeted by a whomping bassline but given kinder treatment on the flipsides retro love a calm and melodic marriage of intricate keywork and tempered reverbed beats fter reportedly enduring a series of false starts with deep medi musik and his own gangsta boogie imprint heny g is now stepping out with 3 5 records for the first time but despite the heavy dubs and grimey edge of 3 5s catalogue is is the dramatically titled soundtrack of an artist completely surrendering to melodic instinct soars with swirling ambient synths and a mellow dub sway grounded by a bassline that sinks inwards rather than propelling forwards is marked by breezy synth work skittering kicks and chattering percussion as the rapidly escalating arpeggios and a vibrato bassline juxtapose each other closer possesses a stillness with a loosely stepping rhythm and lingering clouds of static chords the delectably melancholy feel clings to each note like mist with well-defined electronic influences giving the gentle roller some added bite succeeding in reducing both the dub and the step to secondary players without leaving the arrangement toothless looks to be a key player for the future of melodic soulful dubstep
gerard hansons music often sounds lonely a trait he shares with a lot of electro producers his records are few and far between though has been more fruitful: he released an e r p 12-inch in pril and now hes back with his first record since 2007 oddly it lands on erlin label cido who usually stick close to their established tight-knit community ut when you put the record on it makes sense as hanson puts away the drum machines and zeroes in on the essence of his sound the record consists of two side-long cuts each around 12 minutes they both focus on similar nose-diving chord progressions that evoke someone processing bad news in real-time the -sides slow crawl is a far cry from hansons dextrous electro work and its beatless canvas gives it plenty of room to feel out imagine a dopplereffekt track wiggling from its tight confines and billowing into the space around it essentially one long exhale the track gets weirder and trippier as it runs along but never lets go of its sadness the flipside is even more melancholy with less movement the synth leads stream out in long flowing patterns that recall mid-70s pink floyd it might sound different than what were used to from but what hasnt changed is his exquisite stillness if anything underlines why hanson has such a dedicated following: his talents extend considerably beyond the limits of the electro that first made him famous and tap into something more universal and human
as was the case on his previous releases for the likes of hyercolour and losing suki craig mcnamaras ep finds him living up to his artist name taking from a huge array of sources including hardcore electro jungle and garage mcnamara has an assured take on each style he alights on resulting in an ep that sounds more like a compilation than the work of one artist opener miradad begins like a regulation techno banger before a classic hardcore diva vocal sends it off in a completely different direction a hardcore bass groove dominates the rest of the track as jungle drums flash in and out of the mix is an electro slow-burner whose regal pattern of low notes meshes pleasingly with a sedate acid bassline trevino remixes turning it into the kind of punchy house stormer weve come to expect from him meanwhile nails a disco/chicago house feel through soft bass pulses gently descending synths and a croaky vocal refrain
on english riviera and nights out joe mount the main creative force behind seemed to be working to a specific purpose: transforming what indie rock could be by bathing it in the glamour disco 80s synth pop and contemporary r b mount is a diligent student songcraft in the brainy british tradition prefab sprout or scritti politti and his best tracks such as heartbreaker and bay were indie-dance classics at once euphoric and melancholic is a subtly but significantly different album recorded at londons toe rag a vintage analogue studio where white stripes have worked this record still has an electronic undertow but its also dominated by pastoral folk and 60s psychedelic pop influences historically mounts sleek computerised music sounded like it emerged from conflicted nights on club dance floors but is more mature doleful and disconnected from club trends title tracks ineffectual motown homage and the drippy paisley-patterned rock songs or fail to make a case for such nostalgia nor does a painstakingly traditional italo disco track is far more interesting when these peculiar elements intertwine has a quicksilver vocal informed by mounts love aaliyah but with all its tape hiss and cheap drum machine sounds it could be a home demo im a track which combines several generations r b is likewise stripped any patronising production polish and consequently achieves a potent intimacy in these strange moments the krautrock pop or the transcendent mount still sounds like a singular talent gently pushing music forward
peter prestas applejaxx recordings start the new year with a sound weve become accustomed to-rolling tribal house beats this time round its a debut - from on vocals the original mix is chunky and choppy kicking off from the start with a toughened groove of tribal rhythms along with maries seductive vocal which begins to take control delaying into the background as proceedings filter down before gradually working back up adding a driving bassline to get things moving the pressure stays at maximum only easing off for the break filtering back the elements again as elongated swirling sounds work their way around the now orgasmic vocal on the a side is the peter presta mix smoothening out the drive behind the original and making full use of the come to bed vocals with a little help from a stabby beckoning synthline gradually coming to the fore and dissipating into the distance
adelaide-based producer sidwho s second 12-inch of might at first appear to rank as his most subdued number yet but thanks to some nifty drum programming it ends up as a snappy piece of indie disco low 120s are where the multi-instrumentalist has drawn the most acclaim his 2009 vote bowie for president was picked up by a slew of slo-mo house and disco djs and continues to excel this time around the analogue haze that has characterised much of sidwho s solo productions doesnt stick around for too long resulting in a more refined and cleaner sound as a result the jilted percussive-focus of this a-side lends itself to a slightly more robust time slot than your usual sidwho fare on the flip session have been enlisted to provide a dub result is a pleasant house excursion where the pair introduce an intermittent midrange filter while drawing out the originals vocals morphing bassline and delicate synth melody combine well but it doesnt quite match the workability of sidwho s crisp drums and dramatic keys
people will say what theyd like about sascha dive but its impossible to deny his passion for house music many people talk a good game few bother to back up those words and release music by them dive has used his clout to present the work of deep house producers such as scott ferguson brothers moodymann and now to new audiences and simultaneously pushed a distinctly frankfurt-centric take on the genre as well sees new jersey get the most representation on wax: qu and both turn up on the -side qus is in his now-standard chugging style of house that allows for a large amount of room for abstraction the weirdness comes in the form of queasy strings a two-note synth line and a single piano note that seems to stretch forever take it apart and you have an absolute mess in qus hands it feels strange and wonderful brothers does what he does best on his remix: he finds the groove and runs it into the ground piling accents and touches throughout that helps it feel like its ended someplace far from where it started (even though it clearly hasnt ) dive himself takes the b-side all 14:44 of it and lays down a typical rheinmain beat loopy relaxed and with little to hold onto it replaces the urgency of the -side for surface vibes to take this remix deeper youll need an a cappella or two
lyon isnt the first place you think of when you hear uncompromising techno but a lyon-based techno militia thats put out a growing roster of podcasts from the likes of eric cloutier and marcelus are working to change that the crew is now quietly moving into the vinyl game and their first 12-inch comes courtesy the mysterious an artist who has not under that name at least been involved with the podcast series or (as best as we can tell) anything else for that matter while the lean mean tracks theyve pressed to wax dont give any further indication of whos behind them the sheer physicality of the music lends the release a tangibility that belies its anonymity has the aggressive thump and earsplitting cymbals of so many white label techno records but in its expansive dub rumble it goes to great lengths to be immersive somewhat less punishing sonically nevertheless picks up the pace urging arms up and setting feet to a gallop both tracks get remixes and both remixes come from london fundamental who recently collaborated with opuswerk on a track for plak records reels in a bit trading the originals enormity for more subtle intensity ben of perc trax and sect records does something similar with : his cleaner lines and carefully considered compositional tweaks take s massive sounds well into morning
may be an italian but he sure as hell sounds as if hes mannheim born-and-raised on his newest 12-inch for plus 8 is such a boom-tchk exemplar in the c cille tradition in fact that you half-expect children singing the hook to sunshowers to pop up halfway through instead you get competing melodies that play brilliantly off one another a veritable bach counterpoint by techno standards the key as it is with all of this new-fangled mannheim house is the forward momentum engendered by the irrepressible beat but carolas light and frothy hook makes it something special not so much for which brings up the b-side in unspectacular fashion effortless this one aint as carola draws up various templates and throws them all into the pot for your delectation theres the bass drop the melody moving up and down even a rarely repeated bass hiccup like its going to most likely work excellently in certain types of sets but its meat for the grinder a track built specifically to fit there is a moment where almost sounds industrial a sign of life in the breakdown but as you might expect its quickly extinguished in favor of business as usual maybe theres more life in mannheim right now than there is in minimal techno but ill take the -side any day
caps off a busy with the launch of his new label following solid work from peak on robsoul air london and tsuba s o o n is a confident start for the imprint the title track shows many of the hallmarks that have gained peak attention but he further develops them through a definite techno edge with a muscular kick and metallic percussion underpinning a murmuring sub and aggressive stabs soon into its stride the male/female vocal and shiny pads contrast against the machine-gun acid notes and rhythmic shuffles following a largely vocal-free dub that loses none of the originals punch is a remix from mike flipping the ep on its head with a glowing version that uses a trio of melodic patterns its an ever-changing workout from one of detroits finest greek producer stays closer to home with an elemental rework that aims for 5 am smoke-filled rooms via a rough-hewn percussive feel and brash leads
if you have a tendency to get uk young guns lurka and mixed up then this ep may perplex you further oth artists operate in the futuristic techno space opened up by outfits like livity sound and with his track finds a sound not dissimilar from lurkas partials oth tunes are druggy and intense marrying uk funky syncopations with supremely twisted synth work fortunately this isnt exactly well-trodden ground if anything it would be nice to see more producers exploring this strange and intense micro-genre s return to eneaths label dovetails neatly with his debut from last year draw for the the same rough-edged percussion sour synth work and utterly dank reverb settings predominate on they hit a new intensity: the synth line wanders erratically in pitch and the drums constantly crest and fall giving the thing a panicked momentum t first seems to have gone too far: the irradiated synth goo almost waterlogs the beat ut slowly notches up the techno thrust speeding us into a dark and uncertain future
i m not sure it s absolutely true that dancing is like fucking for one thing dancing gets better the longer you keep going but with the exception of sting and the people who keep sending me emails about cialis most people aren t too interested in fucking for more than a couple of hours no doubt this will prompt a flurry of boastful comments but i stand by this statement not least because of chafing issues one thing is similar though i think and that s that everyone has a natural rhythm and way they like to move and it s quite difficult (and usually not all that enjoyable) to deviate too far from it then is a bit of a specialist taste if you re into foursquare pump-pump-pump until climax his kind of scribbly meandering isn t going to get you very aroused if on the other hand you re a double sideways swoop kind of person maui s will be right up your er something deceptively housey at the start with a kick-snare pattern and twinkly keys soon overlays the odd broken beat on the basic rhythm and lets loose one of those stuttering jerky basslines that s somewhere between funky and glitchy this will layer beautifully in the mix with more standard house fare but will sound completely different once it gets going and make about ten percent of most club crowds spastically ecstatic nd just to geek out for a second the kick-snare here is perfect with just the right smidgin of offset to make it irresistible classic production basically in is more lumpen in comparison a heavy beat and more of a techno feel albeit at a slower tempo it s a slow builder with sampled shouts and cut up tribal chants over a rhythm that wants to be simultaneously steady and erratic with a tension between the heavy kicks and the odd partial drum roll ut there s a hell of a lot of depth here it sits right on the line between sounds and rhythms being unexpected but also being in exactly the right place as soon as you hear them it s not an obvious anthem but at the right time once people have attuned themselves to the music this would be amazing overall this is a fantastic release with toning down those broken beat influences a little to fit in with rush hour s aesthetic but still delivering a delightfully tricksy musical experience nd despite the analogy probably best listened to in the club not the bedroom

first appeared on jonathan lisle s brilliant bedrock original series mix from a few months back and the track was so much admired by jon that he snapped up this gem production by to appear on his imprint the original mix the track that concluded the mix previously mentioned is quite simply stunning it is intense from the word go with nice crisp broken beats helping to build the track alongside some smooth yet driving baselines soon enough a furious set of synths come into the track and gives it a boost of energy until it takes a massive breakdown midway in gives the track a breather before it erupts into action once again helped this time by a tasty melodic line a very uplifting piece of work here by the medway mix on the flip is a much smoother interpretation that flows at a smooth pace throughout nice warm melodies set the mood for this more laid back remix a remix that features some pretty chilled and not too intense beats and rhythm the medway remix is quite nice on the flip but it is the pure energy and flow of the original that does the business here
has a problem common to many prolific artists his discography is so large that it risks blurring together the similarities between his hazy deep house productions overshadowing the subtle differences the debut on s label which gathers a handful of the germans collaborations shows that there are indeed differences oddball and restlessly inventive the ep pulls in multiple directions at once the precise direction of each track seems to be dictated by the collaborator the a side features two spots from chicagolands who pairs his fiddly asymmetrical patterning with s cooler moods in standard style each track seems uncertain as to where its headed starts as a robust hard swung drum track then settles into some noir ish looped chords in the second half the raspy drums and bleak melody of riff on early chicago house melancholy at first but the spongy chords bouncing in take us somewhere quite different the b side is odder still on the mischievous from s duo with nathan jonson sax samples move manically in pitch over a broken beat groove the late pay off is a think break mixed so low that you could almost be imagining it with m zigue of parisian label d ko is a beguiling swirl of loosely connected sounds: tinkling harp noodling keys bursts of what might be film dialogue a discoid pulse enters and briefly brings everything into line but it exits just as quickly like the rest of the ep the track suggests tantalising directions for s music but doesnt follow them too rigorously
when i initially heard s the i didnt think much of it its a nice enough track with obvious big room intentions but there was little hook to keep me coming back either at home or even when ive heard it on the dance floor ut heard it i have its inescapable in some quarters nd thats not a bad thing because it does its job quite well nd i understand the need to play the newest tunes the need to support the efforts of fellow producers and the need to play the one song that everyone is waiting for at that special moment of the night ut like many of the tracks that seem to get caned mercilessly and enter into 20xx anthem status i cant help feeling that we could do better solid tune solid producer but its certainly not a pox on ell clap dance enfants (chants) una pena or even nesrib which seemed to all do similar things not so long ago -side follows in the same tradition but i tend to enjoy it more because of the way that voorn beats his vocal sample into the ground before giving you the quick release of letting the uncredited singer finish her wordless cry gain were not reinventing the wheel here and in hasnt tried to but for some graceful dance floor tools you could do a lot worse just dont try to play either by themselves and ask me to remember them in the morning
since debuting in 2011 have made steady strides within the crowded sphere of uk house duos latest outing is a bournemouth collaboration as alex warren and sam king join forces with successful local promoter myles lloyd and his new label starts the release in lively enough fashion playing an echoed monologue on keeping the funk alive over a high-pitched 303 classic chords and a persistent bassline though executed with punchy clarity its by now an exhausted combination uk duo purple fare marginally better on the remix initially smothering the original elements for a smoother ride they later inject a rampant set of electro synths for added pump if just by the feel of its off-beat rhythm stirs the senses merging with warm piano and crackly phone recordings to form an endearing whole but its romanias blacktee who veers furthest from the tired club-house canon that steals the show flipping the original on its head with a techy remix
cadenza not special anymore yeah weve gone over that but now weve got a digital sub-label which should only add fuel to the raging bonfire as purists finally give in to the digital revolution though (or at the very least stop shouting from the rooftops and acknowledge the ways things are in ) youll likely see the stigma associated with digital-only releases fade into the distance for his part gives immediate credence to by virtue of providing its debut release the two track ep clocks in at a weighty 35 minutes as the label boss takes full advantage of the format and stretches things out interminable to some maybe but thats hardly the point and are like soups that only get good once theyve had the time to absorb the juices of everything around them sets out lovely beats in each and then sets each to boil slowly throwing in extra hi-hats here and little nuggets of synthesizer there each has the same taste of some of his earliest productions for cadenza taking their power from the microscopic and intricate is the more immediate of the two by virtue of the stunning kora that enters into the proceedings at six minutes but both prove that digital-only doesnt necessarily mean second-rate instead its simply another way to get your music into peoples hands a lesson that vinyl purists might bother contemplating the next time that their limited edition release doesnt sell out

adam routh pete gooding team up under the moniker of drax gooding to bring you this latest release on records 2 mixes of the track are supplied and cater for the chunky end of the house spectrum the original mix is quite a nice unique piece of work essentially tribal in most parts the drums are chunky and solid however the track has quite a nice acid influence in it with the main acidic riff rolling for the duration of the track as the vocal builds so do the sounds in the track with acid hooks and synth stabs increasing the intensity of the track in certain parts the remix on the flip is slightly tougher the baselines increase and the sounds get a little tougher and edgier the vocal is cut up for the most part and then comes into full effect midway in and at this time the track starts to gather in pace with the chunky baseline melodic touches and drum work all uniting in great harmony a quality up beat remix here on the flip not a bad release by the duo and a pretty impressive release for the tribal based label
id like to see someone stand still when this shit drops zomby once said of s a 1992 hardcore anthem that pairs a definition of sound sample with mike oldfields tubular bells emerged during an especially fertile stretch for phil fearons production house records which also released acens trip ii the moon and baby ds let me be your fantasy in 1992 swaps hardcores rave piano stabs and air horns for noxious acid splashes and ragged bleeps its status as a classic owes a lot to the reggae vocals eerie mysticism but the long-delayed bass drum stabs at the climax there are three breakdowns are what most stand out you wont hear this euphoric coda on s 25th anniversary reissue which opts for a shortened original mix instead the remixers take various liberties with the source material and the results are for the most part impressive dj and s remix samples tubular bells too heavily so the sample and bass drum seem to wrestle special aka paul woolford shows sharper instincts where s dense breakbeats were pestled together woolfords crisp hi-hats and snares are given more space the benefit of his lighter percussion becomes clear as he injects sub-bass into the guts of the track the two other remixers take different approaches in his collage of chants and effects luke pays cheeky tribute to hardcores heyday when the strips down to its bones he extracts a hip-hop-inspired banger that will shake souls and bodies
s odd on paper as the collaboration might seem one makes jittery electro the other makes fairly conservative house these days the formidable pairing of joy o oddika has already produced one anthem the acid jacker swims it wasnt a one-off and the two analogue denizens have been collaborating regularly and even started their own vinyl-only imprint to distribute the tracks has been one of the most played-out tracks thats surfaced from the collaboration aside from swims but for such a popular track its a confusing structurally ambitious little thing: it starts off with a lumpen kick and distracting offbeat snares coloured by distorted speech and odd sound effects two minutes in a wooden chord emerges collaged and repeated to nauseating extremes this is gloriously messy stuff and flipside only ratchets up the freeform feel its slurred slippery chords are like the melting point between oddikas frantic rigidity and joy os loping chicago-isms building pressure with insistent snares before releasing them with a rather distinctive vocal gasp uild-and-release build-and-release its a predictable track made with unpredictable parts and the result is a banger that never sounds quite right and absolutely revels in its own deformity

hype can be a dangerous thing and k urak sar has it in spades with this release caned by illustrious djs like villalobos and luciano all summer released on the formers boutique imprint to much fanfare within a week of a second release on c cille: does the hype come any larger unfortunately now that the release is on the street and the evidence can be heard by all the sad truth is that doesnt live up to all that advance billing does have some things going for it for sure dynamic and energetic beat/bass combo underpins it and the breakdown in the latter third of the track is effective but stripped of those things what are we left with trumpet and vocal sample run ragged by the three minute mark joined by a second sample that changes places with it about halfway through the run and then a third sample and then a fourth i am loath to refer to tracks as merely dj tools but thats exactly what this is and not a terrifically interesting or inventive one at that comparisons abound to the alkan techno sound of villalobos own fizheuer ziheuer but those are laughable this doesnt show any of the vision and invention found there ad no not by half song of the year no not by half on the flip has a go at which as you might expect from the name uses a clarinet sample rather than a trumpet but also ups the compositional element by roughly 200 varying the beats and moving a few riffs around before the inevitable samples start in screaming fans wandering clarinets etc frankly it would have been better with just the beat shame too because there is an interesting track trying to get out in there somewhere it just gets lost under the ridiculousness simply put this is a gimmick record that doesnt show sars true talent (which he does in fact possess) save your money and pick up nesrib instead even if you really love this track in the clubs chances are very slim that you will actually want to sit through it at home
as any good beathead knows many minor dance records contain moments glory ruined by wack vocals a sloppy refrain or a sore-thumb session musician solo collects rotterdam-based dj and consummate disco freak -es tight workmanlike and ten brilliant re-edits such tarnished eurodisco gems culled from his trips to northern europes secondhand shops -e has graciously cut out the chaff in these regional non-hits and refitted them for maximum disco appeal approaching as a continuous listening experience though is a dangerous one instead its probably better to view it as a compilation isolated moments rather than a linked set tracks or a flowing mix many these numbers are very self-contained and though the sequencing reflects some attempt to present a coherent whole this is a ride that will occasionally come to a screeching halt so while fans the cbs radio shows morgan geists unclassics series wonky italo sides and flat-out beaty madness will find much to digest and enjoy others may balk at the very nature the collated beast the disco here is a rarefied sort and the heavy reliance on the odd bits these jams means that a number the tracks simmer along very nicely but dont quite smoke as down- or midtempo tension-builders however many the edits excel whose layered legend the magical island synths recall phaedra -era tangerine dream; or which plays out moroder-esque synth voyages over a stiff midtempo beat some these excursions really break out the space dust: for instance sounds like nothing else a jazzy electronic roadfilm that collides into an andean panpipe ensemble jamming with a gamelan-esque percussion outfit before a tribal chant swoops in to guide the disco jalopy back to detroit the most successful moments on occur when -es merciless grasp alights on a groove sick enough to squeeze (the carribeana bills the clap-happy ) and slick enough to slide into a rousing chorus (the hip-slapping stellar opener ) when a break is left to meander about on its own with no real change in tempo or source material the results are interesting enough but clearly intended for the deep fans rather than the weekend crowd but those few those happy disco few will find indispensable whether they chop it up into playlist fodder mix it into their sets as stellar build-up tracks that slide perfectly into their own secret weapons or simply bug out to it as a stoned post-party dessert they will be inspired by -es impeccable taste and splicing prowess

19 454 18 5 25 5 18 made his prince move back in 2011 after producing a trio of 12-inches for horizontal ground that alongside efforts from szare and nd were central to the imprints early run of form under his new alias the shadowy swiss producer continued to peddle a form of ultra-distilled techno with the self-released speed bomb / fond of rae his silence since then has been long enough to assume that his inspiration died alongside the 90s-referencing white-label scene that spawned him fortunately a new record for clone sublabel jack for daze proves us wrong theres always been a subtle but infectious funk to the numbers guy s productions a certain swing borrowed from ghetto house that enlivens the stringent minimalism of his arrangements has this quality in well spades its speedy even by the standards of past 19 454 productions pogoing along at 140 bpm while it unfolds in a pretty rote manner a drip-drip of slashing hi-hats claps and percussion over its near-ten minute length the sheer grooviness of it carries us through clones serge lower the tempo on a pair of remixes giving that itchy swing space to breathe the original remix places the pitch-bent synths centre stage while the dub dispenses with even the barest of decoration for maximum dance floor functionality

second-guessing what is going to do next has been like juggling water in other words impossible but lately bob bhamra has seemingly settled close to sampleadelic house music the follow-up to last years rattlingly good 8 track cartridge ep for hypercolour sticks with the format but it takes a softer and at times quirkier approach is soaring cut-up disco house its stuttering breakbeat tickled by widescreen salsoul strings which give it a hint of andr s new for u bhamra dials the intensity back a smidge on rolling out a rhodes loop strapping on an emotional soul vocal and more stirring strings in fact its not until whats the that you reach a track thats close to the fervor of 8 track cartridge its a sparky soulful update of buffalo springfields for what its worth with whisper it crossover potential and a sting in its tail in the shape of a grin-inducing breakbeat bhamra then throws a curveball: is an idiosyncratic dj scruff-style stomp with a pummeling clavichord loop thats embellished by conga slaps and chattering hi-hats one things for sure wncl will never do ordinary
two of the years simplest dance floor pleasures have been s and geeemans bangt : though utterly ubiquitous (and dangerously hummable to boot) each was too charming to really get annoying even when they made their third or fourth appearance over the course of a single club night thus the ever-on-the-ball folks at had the good sense to bring fitzgerald and geeeman (aka the dutch producer best known as gerd) together on a single groove and while gerds pair of remixes of dont make for as deadly a pop-house sugar rush as they theoretically could theyll certainly give djs something new to cane as draws to a close of gerds two mixes the one under his new ny alias hits hardest: throwing some much-needed grit but not much else into fitzgeralds spartan groove gerd gives us a nice update without fixing the unbroken the geeeman rework takes more liberties with the material leaning heavier on the chicago touchstones that characterized bangt the melding though feels like more of a stretch than youd expect if gerd looked to augment or add to what made fitzgeralds originals so catchy then british house oddball gerry took the opposite approach the extent to which has transformed is commendable but in scraping out the originals ear candy and re-stuffing it with noisy drums and cloudy half-melodies hes left it a little flabby and lifeless
of all the sounds and subgenres to grow out of american dance music in the past decade moombahton is one of the most unusual a hybrid of dutch house and reggaeton its undulating whine was inescapable for a while pioneered by dave nada and favoured by big-name djs like skrillex and diplo as nada and matt nordstrom became de facto poster boys for the sound but the label doesnt completely fit ir earliest records are more informed by house and electro and at decibel last year they played a set of refined melodic house which is just what they deliver on this surprising debut album duo apparently see as more of an evolution than a reinvention moombahton itself was an experimentation so moombahton is alive in this album because were experimenting nada recently said falling has lumbering kick drums that are more like anchors than anything propulsive recalling the slow sway of moombahton (as does moody highlight ) doesnt feel like a straight dance floor record but rather one that absorbs tropes from dance genres something that suits friends of friends their new home is most easily comparable to tomas barfods salton sea an underrated record that approached dance music with a similarly kaleidoscopic palette and an ear for great hooks y go straight-up pop with on fortified by roiling drum bass low-end and then veer towards psychedelic free-association on which features a typically scorching vocal from have a keen sense of musicality that goes beyond the mindless blare of moombahton which makes their driving dance floor moments feel a bit reserved has a vocal sample that borders on screamo but unfurls in gorgeous slow motion while their requisite 303 track ids finds a middle-ground between clich d revival and sad acid sounds s approachability is both a strength and a weakness ts civilized enough to move on from moombahton but at times its crossover aspects seem too calculated that feeling is exacerbated by a slice of sunny-day dilla that bursts with colour in a way that makes the rest of the album sound straight-laced is a solid step in a different direction and immaculately produced by two talented musicians but considering dave nada is an artist credited for creating a whole new genre it feels a little safe so far s transition is toward cozy familiarity rather than something truly new
s previous album 2004s kill your radio was a half-successful attempt from the producer to creep out of dj hells overbearing shadow while severing ties with the electroclash scene yet anyone who has seen carretta perform knows hes less interested in strutting his suave stuff than tweaking knobs to maximize the in-yr-faceness of his music that said carretta has lately spent much of his time a r-ing for his own label promoting a blend of vocal pop and techno that people are generally calling electro these days and despite his best intentions tracks on arent a great departure from ly toy or even his defining electroclash moment vicious game as youd expect female vocals from old friend gigi succ s are overtly sultry and vocoders seem to pop up just about everywhere else overwhelming theme sound and decipherable lyrics all seem to either be about sex dancing or space traveling (sometimes its all three at once but arent these synonyms anyway ) its all very melodic with sci-fi pads floating all over a 125 bpm tempo a template borrowed wholesale from moroder unfortunately youd have a hard time stating the differences between and and the album neither has a higher or lower moment: tracks arent technically mixed together yre simply juxtaposed one after the other with barely a slight micro-second pause all but enhancing the overall feeling of seamlessness and sameness carretta is no dj koze: he doesnt care about covering new aural grounds just perfecting his niche even so youd be hard pressed to name another contemporary techno producer that blends italo discos poise and drama with ebms dynamics and confrontation as well as carretta so at the end of the day the covert art says it all: a woman is playfully riding carrettas moustache much to his obvious delight listening to will on a good day make you feel like both
highgrade is a tech house label might not the most lauded of musical forms consisting by and large of functional tracks with one thing on their mind: keeping the groove locked hypnotic and danceable highgrade does it in spades with release after release that always manage to keep things funky is from paris not exactly a tech house stronghold but hes cut from a slightly different cloth to his brethren his first outing on highgrade doesnt necessarily bring anything new to the table but you cant argue when its this well arranged in its original form pushes all the right buttons simple melody sits on top of a rolling bassline with nice attention to detail surrounded by subtle sonics that ebb and flow with a lightness of touch more deftly layered than a black forest gateau and twice as tasty the tom e and remix respects the original by doing very little its almost as if they took out the glitches and subtleties because they knew that if they removed anything else they would have to improve on it a difficult task it feels more cavernous than the original but it lacks warmth is an interesting flipside to with a detroit-inspired ambience theres a rawness to it but it still comes across as very polished gaining a shrewd momentum that just stops short of pandemonium when you least expect it ll three tracks are very playable and well-produced and overall this is an accomplished release that bodes well for the future

menacing techstep from the mid-90s influences s sound but rather than being a throwback factory the label reflects drum basss progression over the last decade much of the bristol operations output doesnt even include breaks leaving the mid-range ominously empty while emphasising space bass and texture and when breaks do feature like in ruffhouses remix of kilo by aspect gremlinz or overlooks nights into dreams / scarlett they feel like breaths of fresh air rather than nostalgia s latest ep feels more indebted to the past but theres a minimalism and linearity that puts it in the present the no u-turn label is a touchstone but its 90s blueprints were sequenced more frenetically than these refreshingly measured tracks the keening string pads that open and are textbook techstep much of the breaks are also standard issue but the familiarity and restraint makes the peak moments of each track all the more effective take say the subs that enter at 2:20 in suddenly it sounds like someone is moving sheets of paper around a microphone a curious texture amplified by a pad that sounds equal parts sci-fi and eerie cloister is also deceptively classicist but subtle quirks garbled voice the entire mix being sucked into a lone bass wobble reveal a measured take on what can be an overly severe style of music isnt holding back but the unlikely coincidence of intensity and understatement makes this record a subtle killer
the label and party run by and uli k have recently played a key role in keeping londons ever-evolving club sounds on the move ang lico is the follow-up to s debut demonico released a year ago on codes visionists collaborative label with pan like demonico ang lico is full of tough pounding drums especially which strips things down to little more than distorted kicks but s trick is making a heavy club stomp sound nimble with syncopated latin flair something that becomes apparent early on with the second track has chilean roots and while you may hear echoes of cumbia or reggaeton filtering these kinds of influences through the urban dread of london is what makes the music feel special each of the four central tracks has its own rhythmic personality but theyre all tied together with a ravey post-industrial sound palette and the angelic sounds of childrens voices sampled and altered for all its dance floor utility is probably the most straightforward beat evian ups the already high brash factor with his typically trance-referencing remix of it but while this level of full-blooded intensity can be hard and noisy its also exciting giving all of that some swing feels great
in the pitched battle between minimal vs boredom there are times when i worry about the troops at the frontline armed with little more than the power of disavowal ( we re not that [dreaded boring] minimal ) and a cracked copy of ableton they re constantly fighting against dead repetitions without the support of melody chorus or vocals y re out there vulnerable with little more than a penchant for timbre basslines and the ability to bomb the soundscape with fx nonetheless they struggle tirelessly to keep the swarming abyss of monotony from the tender minds of jaded dancers whose temporary enjoyment would be pillaged and violated should such ennui ever overcome their defences re are a few known strategies that work in this war but the three most successful are hook atmosphere and narrative heartthrob s baby kate has the first strategy: without ever going anywhere or suggesting more than you get the gist of in the first minute the song leaves you craving that damned hook you don t want the track to go anywhere so compelling is the holding pattern of the loop second strategy atmosphere is the toughest one to get right because after all you re relying on something as insubstantial as a gas anders ilar is a producer who often deploys this approach successfully: even after the fourth minute when you realise the track is going nowhere you still tend to want to hear it through or maybe it s just that you can t move to turn it off with such an icy hand around your heart third strategy is best exemplified by matt ear s excursions as false (although these excursions manage to deploy all three at their opportune moments) y keep your ears glued to the phone or keep your hips swinging as the great unfolding story enfolds you in it constantly moving and deforming until it becomes suddenly and atmospherically a deadly hook by agn s (pronounced ah-nyes not ag-nuss) is an ambitious attempt at deploying a three-pronged attack similar to ear s this is a work that seems to want to overcome the componential nature of its structure and present a cohesive piece that is simultaneously atmospheric unfolding and engagingly catchy ebuts begins at the a shadowy place emptied of animals and filled with dusky gloom re are voices in the empty reverb tank snatched back to nothing by quick snips it s a stretched silence between this and which melds a micro-boompty bassline to a very you on t need a weatherman -era carsten jost theatre of dubbed-out anxiety which turns the lights down and takes the paranoia up a few notches setting the stage for the remainder of proceedings sprinkles silicon-dry digital debris over a huge wiggling bassline that waits for the kick to drop when it does fall it s so compressed that it hurts my ears while on the stereo it stretches my poor old 0s-era kef loudspeakers beyond their modest range no doubt it sounds killer on a powerful system is a very wighnomy-esque fx fest that (again) employs a very speaker-pushing compressed kick/bass combo to drive things along on breaks up what has by this stage in the album become a monotonous pattern of track construction with the same elements used and re-used to similarly reliable (if predictable) effect with its long ambient intro and direction-suggesting melodic loop toward the end the track hints at the possibility of a better way to bring together the atmosphere and hooks but it s a track that fades out too soon comes over all warp/modern love on you after the repeated pummeling of the floor/functional numbers with sad strings and a big bad melancholy bassbin rattling synthline that brings things back down while closes the album with a pop-ambient elegy last track also functions as a reminder that this album is aiming at synthesing both hooks and atmospheres into a storyline but it comes all too late by the time dropped i was already fighting my own battle against boredom it s a folly of inexperience more than a lack of talent with time practice and experience agn s could well become capable of representing the sound-structures he is so far at least only capable of presenting and in so doing he could justly and skillfully come to relate his own tales of boredom-slaying as a description of agn s personal battle thus far against boredom this most genre-specific of enemies amounts to something lethargically oversoaked in its own the atmosphere capable of sidling up to and often swinging with some interesting hooks but fundamentally too preoccupied with making the same point again and again to rip a coherent engaging yarn
wes grays debut release as moon b which appeared last year through ppu felt very much like a home-listening affair since then however the atlanta synth-boogie producers output has shown a growing engagement with the dance floor first with the sussegad ep which saw tracks from the album re-released in a louder dj-friendly pressing and then with entropic feelings a more uptempo outing for london label going good grays appearance under the new - alias on athens imprint disques gives him a chance to flex his house muscles once more each of these three tracks is underpinned by a stolid four-four kick and each is fractionally more propulsive than the last with grays subtly funky basslines and mobile harmonic structures supplying moments of uplift he appears to have scrubbed up his signal chain too: where tape hiss and over-zealous reverb settings may previously have turned off djs these productions punch and sizzle in all the right places in mood however theyre just as soporific as anything gray has released the single is fleshed out with a pair of highly tone-sensitive remixes budapest producer route s version of is fractionally more streamlined a touch loopier but equally cashmere-soft a restruction of the same track from hellenic homegrown talent retro:grade adds some gorgeous lapping percussion and switches the ratio to widescreen
luke chable launches his very own imprint in with a release from in and it marks the beginning to a label with a very high potential seeing luke is at the wheel the 4am mix is first up and it is quite a strong record to say the least chunky driving percussion helps kick things on early before the eerily intricate and very seductive vocal patterns come into the track and give it a very strong identity the mood is very interesting as the vocals take over and as the name of the remix suggests this track oozes of some late night peak time action especially as the sharp stabbing synth patterns come in the break your ass dub turns the track into a sinister broken beat anthem using the killer vocal patterns as well as an absolutely storming baseline in the 2nd half of the track the beats are lively and ever changing making this remix just as good as the awesome original mix a quite stunning opening release to this very exciting new imprint and i m sure the quality will continue to come from trojan
vapor city archive concludes a year-long audio-visual project structured around travis stewarts exploration of an imaginary city ut dont worry if that concept has passed you by subscribers to the vapor city citizenship programme may be able to map within that larger work but for newbies any album is intriguing on its own musical merits theres always a lot going on in s music and is no exception from a seasick swirl of surging bass that never quite breaks out into a jungle track to which echoes the wide-eyed qualities of synth pioneers like tangerine dream stewart consistently subverts the labels bass music footwork electronica that you might use to describe his music instead he creates dense vignettes that at their best resonate before you can deconstruct them a bit of footwork with a vintage soul vibe and the breathless lt;3 are cases in point the longer you mull it over the stranger seems its chopped up vocals recall both the chipmunk tics of early uk hardcore and oneohtrix point nevers hallucinatory micro-loops ut the first thing that strikes you is that it sounds gorgeously heartbroken elsewhere though cracks begin to show in stewarts restless creative quest and the quirkily irritating which weld folk guitars onto footwork and drum bass respectively both drift by as cute ideas in need of a hook conversely the albums most orthodox vocal track is also its weakest clearly stewarts future does not lie in crossover r he should drill down into his musical imagination to open up ever weirder deeper seams
with a junglist resurgence in full swing s timing couldnt be better until now the new york-based artist was known for his hip-hop productions and his work with joey bada on his first record for though he goes full-bore jungle this move might seem out of leftfield were it not for bannons childhood stint in sacramento a city where the spirit of the jungle (and its child drum bass) has long burned strong reconciles old school jungle with modern hip-hop particularly the more cannabinoid strains of cloud-rap result is one of the most welcomely surprising records in recent memory from the first moments of rezorectah the breaks sound like theyre trying to slice right through you but after that pummelling intro the track dissipates into ambience a gaseous wispy atmosphere that carries haunting melodies on its chilly breeze by the time you get to the punishing jungle madness of with its hoover synths and blaring horns its clear that is a dynamic record as prevalent as amen breaks are on the lp more often than not bannon is holding the chaos back rather than letting it rip psychedelic maps out jungle in a slower almost trap-influenced structure while standout flirts with lex luger style hi-hats letting them naturally morph into breaks bannon isnt afraid to twist the sound into new shapes is ruled by the sticky humidity of its ambient passages on a burial-esque soundscape threatens to outshine the sterling drum work all rainy-day melancholy and gasped vocals fans of lee gambles diversions will find something to like here imagine if that record gave in to its more rhythmic desires thanks to its quieter passages breathes in and out gradually never lingering or sprinting for too long album reaches its climax with a ten-minue track that showers the listener with breaks then simply lets everything drift off in space like the record as a whole its sublime

icons like larry heard dont need to release new music and sometimes its actually better if they dont with influential accomplishments behind such auteurs like you know spearheading a world-renowned genre theres an outsized expectation that looms over their every move no doubt heard has put out his fair share of unflattering tunes over the decades but always with the same casual grace the memphis resident carries himself with his mr fingers alias however hasnt released new tracks since the mid-90s this puts mr fingers in a unique position whats first apparent about the four tracks on mr fingers is how timeless they sound that is its impossible to pin down when heard recorded them the tapestry of disconnected rhythms and sparse muted melodies in feels current for its sheer complexity while the spoken word in and modulated robo-voice in nodyahed hint at vintage methods is a lavish deep house masterwork that wouldve been right at home around the turn of the century though billed as mr fingers sounds less connected to heards oldest alias than loosefingers his eclectic house project responsible for a few records in the mid-00s the spacey groove in lamentation and how transmission x flaunts acid notes and digital pads points directly to the mindset here but loosefingers 2011 track winterflower might be the closest precursor: from the austere piano chords to the subtle syncopation and galactic fx heard is prepping the ground where this music would grow classic mr fingers themes centered on love and partying whereas is fueled by the cosmic unknown and noirish tension its a collection of thoughtful lovingly crafted dance tracks of course but remember they were written by a man in his 50s someone with more on his mind than dictating the vibe of an all-night warehouse rave works so well because of its inherent maturity and restraint this is a record of the rich tones elaborate arrangements and melodic depth synonymous with all of heards music is a flawless return not because heard revamped an alias to say something new but because no one else can say what he does with such eloquence
is a contained maximalist on his own he hasnt done anything on his own yet as clearly iconic as ndie in me or dump truck which he made as part of cobblestone jazz but while that groups output has obvious musical connections with the pair of solo eps 2007s wonderful pushcard and 2009s far more skeletal (and iffy) doesnt like you back tate has released on his own his solo work is clearly distinctive the clearest tie with cobblestone is what else jazz but rather than adapting that musics group-improvisatory methods ala the trio (or quartet if the mole-enhanced lineup that made the groups last album holds) tate likes to work with riffs and patterns that sound like they were performed by people whove had a few then tweak them till theyre squiggly airy fizzy and utterly comfortable with their own loopiness take the relatively quiet here the piano and bass and percussion are all playing recognizably jazzy figures very quickly speed is as much a jazz trait as anything but here the instruments speed of delivery feels tweaked and slightly cartoony like someone who can wear neon orange and hot pink together without seeming desperate for attention blanks is more straightforwardly jazz-funky almost loungey with a loose hi-hat pattern very dry snares and nod-along electric keyboards but the vocals snatches of syllables occasionally passing through the mix like extra percussion give the groove more of an off-kilter feel ll goes furthest out changing tempo and feel several times within a short span but if wacky was the point this album wouldnt be worth discussing tates weirdness isnt an end in itself hes rickety and jittery in a way that feels lifelike as well as arty and he layers things in ways that draw connections for instance makes a short hypnotic two-chord piano pattern its base like a midway point between modern jazz piano and the mnemonic riffs at the heart of house music

drum bass producers tend to romanticize jungle the same way that modern house producers do with the old chicago stuff stian ahrenbergs latest single simply called is about as literal as it gets: breaks charge ahead as a voice matter-of-factly intones jungle music its hard to tell if its meant as tongue-in-cheek but the rest of it is serious business even the intro before the drop feels like it weighs two tons this being the track is melancholy and ultra-polished it sounds too modern to be a throwback and feels like a genre exercise than anything exciting forgoes breaks entirely coasting on a precisely programmed minimal rhythm track instead its one long wistful sigh touched with gentle horns and reese basslines that sound worn and exhausted its one of the swedish producers best tracks in recent memory ahrenberg can do jungle just fine but its with stuff like that he really makes his mark

before researching i seriously thought this ep would be a re-release: its classic sounding spacey 4/4 straight from the vaults except it isnt lifes track only came together in with this being their second release the pair presents themselves simply as a mysterious duo with an unashamed affinity for analogue sounds an italian house-leaning skudge then if you will more goes on here than in any skudge wax though and rather than bare repetition its a narrative sonic dynamism which keeps you enthralled throughout in fact sits somewhere between lerosa and omar-s plenty of pinging cowbells endless synth ripples and an overall tension between soft smooth sounds and the more jarring percussive edges in-between the globular has a bleeding acid bassline steamy male groans and proto-melodies that vanish away to a blissful future-retro infinity somewhere off on the horizon on the flip side is a frictionless deep space jam that voyages far on gentle drum tumbles and voluminous kicks somewhat unavoidably detroit looms large as celestial chords ring out above but tweaks on various midi knobs mean the drifting neon synths all around shape-shift in their own delightful ways closes the vintage anthology by getting a little loose and wiggling its ass la deep space orchestra
think and change the upcoming compilation on nonplus could prove to be one the biggest releases of s label is on the vanguard of uk club music these days as you could probably tell from the collections tracklist which includes new material from artists like four tet and pearson sound not to mention s already ubiquitous ig room tech house dj tool tip rriving a couple of weeks before the full compilation presents two new tracks and the results are as strong as youd expect roken might be the raviest track has ever produced from the get go it lurches with delirious intensity its mechanized drums and frantic half melody forming a loose membrane over a shapeless froth of noise the side is more familiar territory and s came out last year on one of the duos coveted sunklo 12 inches and s vip mix has all of the same key details but arranged in a way thats altogether more aggressive here that greasy staccato hook is stretched out into a long and dramatic intro and the drums stampede with ferocious energy its a showy and effective club banger thats still hard not to love
ornaments have managed in only a few releases to fuse an excellent design aesthetic of clear or coloured vinyl and limited labelling and stamped text with some interesting music without adherence to any fixed genre ut while interesting has often meant inconsistent this single sees things cohere for two highly bankable sides of forceful minimal the guilty parties are mod civil the leipzig-based duo of gerrit ehrens and rene wettig who have only appeared elsewhere thus far on czech-based net-label wazzotic records their track here shows plenty of maturity though the opening stretch is sublime minimal tech house with a classical crisp bass kick drum and glassy percussion spread outward by a guttural chugging phase thrown over it like a toreros cape to keep it charging out from underneath rittle snares introduce the slow build up of the melodic line that is half-emotive lament and half-warning siren that only exaggerates the unknown context of the embedded vocals one of klaus kinskis ecstatic and poetic incursions as jesus from the 70s s remix doesnt stray too far from the original in terms of palette but with some ingenious tweaks to drop the bass splinter the snares and smooth out the phased layers he somehow ends up with a track that is more aerial and driving the remix perhaps eclipses the original in terms of intensity but both tracks nonetheless have their own distinct edge of drama ambition and motion that will add plenty of energy to a set

is an intriguing space in the l i e s universe it gives jason letkiewicz who runs the label an outlet to experiment with friends without needing to satisfy the dance floor max d bookworms and terekke have all worked with letkiewicz on the label in one configuration or another improvisation with whatever gear was lying around at the time was the starting point for each release so far this latest release introduces a new project from letkiewicz and the dc artist mike petillo random and repetitive machine-based experiments the four tracks come with the loaded descriptor of ambient warrior values the beautiful title track hints at where the phrase might have come from unfurling into gentle ambient house that recalls jochem peteris work as ross 154 the muddy drums give the only sense of forward momentum leaving petillo and letkiewicz to focus on twisting knobs at 12 minutes hearing is the best way to gauge s methods it springs into life fully formed and reminiscent of idjut boys at their delay-laden best as drums cascade around swirling organs ghostly vocal harmonies and a cavernous dubby bassline around seven minutes in the duo craftily strip away these elements as the track mutates into a dank dub monstrosity was this decision premeditated not likely the track feels like it was cut from a longer improvised session and is a fascinating example of two producers caught deep in concentration

in the last four years most of rs st wes music has come from his alias it shares the musical handwriting as he once put it of his other alias anstam a woodshed-crafted b-movie horror vibe that mightve given the filmmaker roger corman sleepless nights compared with the dubstep techno and idm composites of anstam which produced uneven results s music is less volatile some tracks like 2014s aqua / lemon peel / violet ventured into the haunted mists his alter egos music often evoked otherwise st wes proggy excesses are reined right in an increasingly disciplined approach has strangely enough made st wes music more fun thats never been truer than on as synth chords stretch and convulse in sweet siriusmo-style shapes st we introduces a slapstick 4/4 pound club tracks are seldom this big or this much of a laugh s tip-toe bassline suggests that something sinister still lurks in his music but the tracks flute spirals are a delirious joy is a simpler pleasure a synth jam with matchstick-strike percussion it shares the other tracks intuitive feel less so their exuberant magic
most of s records come with a theme or concept past releases have explored the reclamation of whitewashed tango music and the experience of traveling through western airports as a person of colour deals with s most harrowing subject matter yet the debut ep from is based on her experience at englands immigration removal centres where people are held before theyre deported from the uk these institutions are relatively new privatized and have been the subject of various scandals about living conditions and abuse its not a situation most people would ever expect to find themselves in but thats what makes and as a whole so interesting using the familiar lexicon of dance music it shares stories and perspectives that might otherwise go unheard tells its tale as well as any concept album (it comes with detailed notes explaining each track which doesnt hurt ) gomezs productions align with modern club music a little grime here a little trap there and emphasize space and tension is the eps most melodramatic fare full of harsh screams and icy rhythms that add to the unease is said to chronicle the feeling of solidarity with fellow inmates and it sounds dazed like realizing youre part of something big that you have no control over s hollow drums and chime melodies capture the eeriness of knowing youre being watched s most brutal moment comes at the end is a straightforward portrayal of relief but something lurks underneath its stirring resolute melody a high-pitched whine nags in the background disturbing the peace that might have otherwise been its a potent device illustrating how traumatic events leave their mark long after they end even if you cant see those marks on the surface
in the world of big-room dance music you could do worse than look to 90s house for inspiration the monster a-side from patrick toppings latest single blends gospel wails with crowd noises a fat kick drum and an earworm synth which combine for one of the biggest bombs of toppings ear for classic sounds is well established hes made music with green velvet but its never yielded better results than the tracks bassline does most of the work driving the groove during the periods without a kick drum the energy builds throughout these breakdowns the intensity of the simple synth riff rising as track progresses we dont get a clap until three minutes in so when it finally appears crisp and precise it snaps the groove into place the groove stays steady for the rest of the track rolling underneath choral vocals and diva wails that slice through the bassline dont let the big-room tag fool you like floorplans gospel bangers this is considered dance music that still hits hard the b-side is subtler but also well assembled vaguely tropical with pumping sub-bass and oddball synths its the kind of track joe the hessle audio producer known for wacky house beats would make after a night sweating on the circoloco dance floor the brain-scrambling breakdown is the sort of thing youd hear in a ricardo villalobos set and the best moment on an ep that brings much-needed character to the main stage
where to start with this one first released on vapour in a very limited number in 2000 this soon became one of the most sought after tracks in the progressive world used on paul oakenfolds another world cd and dave seamans global underground 016 cd was where everyone got their mouth to water for this track dave seaman signed it to his audio therapy label for a full release but that was short lived as it was then signed back to vapour where is sat in disrepair for what seemed like ages but here it is for the world with a bit of a facelift for freshness release date has been set for november 24th the original vocal mix was the one that started it all and will be where i start this mix intros with a very heavy tribal feeling with the kick soon ensuing there after subtle vocal hints are used amongst the the sharp sounding hats the first break hits i used to revere you and you instantly recognize this classic the techy bassline just throbs against the rejecting vocals spooky synth stabs appear here and there highten the taste of the track the only lightness to the track is an atmospheric that skips across the foundation wanting to relieve the tension it only gets subdued a climbing main synth pushing through it all she pleads once again building the intensity of the situation and releases it all into a fury of big room sounds after all has subsided you understand why this track is quite a classic on the flip is mark and paul di cristos in and out of therapy mix which was spawned by the label changes a very short sound raining intro begins it all the kick on this mix is very heavy and powerful which fits well with the setting of this mix they quickly got to the point on this one bringing much of it together in only a few measures they tweaked the equalizer on the vocals taking out the lower end of them deep three toned bell sounds were layed over the hats and kick whilst a midtone bass bounces in short paces a hard and heavy tribal matrix hints the pattern in the original mix like mentioned above they have given this track a modern flavor well done by the duo of brothers
both a consummate detroit insider (now based in chicago) and a guy who isnt afraid to have fun within a template of classic sounds caught many an ear with the off-kilter house of walking to guntersville his w t -released vinyl debut and his lighthearted approach continued to shine on his the curiously titled front butt ep on cr me organization earlier this year his latest for seattles is certainly his most polished collection of tunes yet but that doesnt mean theyre any less charismatic than the somewhat rougher tracks weve heard out of his camp previously sparsely rhythmic and thick with lush rhodes chords provides a wonderfully evocative bed for raels spoken-word narrative even if this tale of rhinoceroses and dolphins is nearly unintelligible beneath layers of obfuscating echo the title cut funky bassline in full effect hints at the more g-funkin side of raels sound world generally found only on his undcloud slamming bass is once again in play on with blasting in-the-red synths taking things into stranger and stranger melodic climes short sweet and simple but with a heaviness that leaves a lasting impression might be the records most assured floor-filler even on a record thats rife with them
is a concept album about spirituality and enlightenment and the music s tribute to tribal techno is as moody and meditative as that implies its a step back from the angsty style weve gotten used to from french producer sebastien michel though not wholly surprising s he mentioned when we spoke at the start of the year the early sounds of oliver ho and james ruskin are what first inspired him its the lack of tribal representation in a modern context that fuels him now was written for complete front-to-back listening it maps out a journey of personal discovery as reinterpreted from a self-help book that empowers readers to live in the now album seems to honour the process in its slow-build structure fostering a sense of progression in the loopy elongated nature of the tracks unlike the sound purges mord is usually known for isnt in a hurry to get the most from you have to adjust to its pace it wants your time and it rewards those willing to give it in a way the album works like a well-planned dj set best moments subtly pick you up and carry you off you almost dont notice the fluctuations because of how invested you are in where its all leading it takes a while to warm up by sides c and d ( ) were in peak time mode but without all the build up you cant experience the mid-sections potency to its full extent things get interesting as emotions run high towards the end tense protracted undulation of and the shimmering eureka breakout of are some of the finest points on yre the climax everything has been working towards fter following such a straight purposeful path winds up vaporous beatless and doused in ambiguity ) a 90-second nod to michels breakout ep ends the album feeling inconclusive its a clever choice that leaves the gate wide open for another installment
s important to remember that older tracks were being given extra shots at the market via new remixes long before anyone in dance music was worried about retro overload nevertheless theres been a lot more of it lately and while nostalgia is useful maybe even necessary at times its also too easy an escape route from the present s not like chicago house vet has been laying low lately either you may recall a nice little record he helped make two years ago the gatherings in my system that said its nice to see damiers 1992 ep (as opposed to the that by 1992 approximately one out of every five house producers had released) back in circulation whether the new mixes add anything to it or not in this case they do not a ton but something supernova rolls the word keep around a mix that fondly recapitulates a lot of basic house tricks conga fills busy bass pads organs you know the drill steve s two mixes offer updated versions more filters thicker and deeper kicks more 3d production overall of the classic mk remixes that thrust the track into the spotlight to begin with the original mixes included here say a lot everything about the state of american dance music in 1992 in just over a half-decade house had gone from upstart to mainstream club musics status quo; techno had become the cutting edge reflected that handily: half the mixes are from dub house cut-up legend mk the other half from underground resistance if that were to happen in dance fans wouldnt be able to find enough like buttons to push but back then it was business as usual even better urs radio mix is far more shamelessly poppy than mks rather meh club vocal take that anonymity fetishists their low mix tumbles along on a fast syncopated beat thats more abstract but no less hook-driven mks two other versions are where the tracks heart truly resides the mk dub hurtles past riding a mnemonic metallic riff that drills as hard as the bass but the new dub is the true classic letting the bass and string stabs do the talking with that keep us moving floating through it all friendly like casper the ghost an effervescent reminder of a more innocent time

next up from the department on is 2 productions from first up is distant minds smooth broken beats open the track with a slow droning baseline the track builds and builds with some nice eerie effects as well as some tough screeching electro riffs there are some nice stuttering drum effects that help the production flow as well to produce a great production on the whole soul union is on the flip and the beats are a little more scattered then distant minds the feature of this production though is the deep rumbling baseline that lurks underneath the percussion elements some nice eerie squeals throughout help give this production a bit of an evil dark feel but don t be scared as this is a very bice track indeed another good release by play who continue to impress on the house and breaks front
with a label as stylistically varied as the parisian-based a strong consistent visual aesthetic is often invaluable to presenting a clear artistic vision in some cases such as designer vaughan olivers work for 4ad the look of a record becomes inseparable from the music itself is s oliver designing their sleeves under his check morris alias he also moonlights as a vintage synth aficionado who crafts tasteful balearic jams the whimsy that defines the sleeves for albums like love livery by d k pulses through mottes debut album many tracks such as opener damore unfurl with a filmic patience well-suited for the birds-eye shot in a michael mann neo-noir the title track laps along like low-tide full of old choral patches gently skanking synths and dubby delayed drums here as on domenique dumonts stunning comme a a sharp melodic sensibility begins to emerge i c a and will work best for the djs but theyre just as evocative as the rest of the former keeps to a cinematic feel with its john carpenter-esque house while the latter could pop up in a ng marco set theres one issue with its that its conspicuously tasteful theres a retromania at work that counts labels like music from memory fourth-world japanese music and early releases on klaus schulzes innovative communications among its formatives like with his sleeves motte seems incapable of producing anything that isnt somewhat referential and impossibly hip i find myself wanting motte to say take a keyboard solo that knocks out of tune for half a bar but it never happens its a small qualm and like the best records on mottes debut album is an alluring nuanced escape its also not very long barely topping a half-hour during the brief runtime motte also dips into modern french pop ( ) and with he goes on an exotic journey complete with rainforest samples the music is all subtly psychedelic and brimming with talent feels like it was made while motte blew off steam fresh back from the design office uncorking some wine and firing up the synths and the sounds he conjures at night are no less vivid and visual than the images he makes all day
if you havent taken note of s bold industrial techno then heres your chance to start founded by italian production allies and d with completing the family the label has grown from being an incubator for its three conspirators to welcoming the likes of and into the fold in those four years and d together with lucindo launched 3th which theyve since flooded with varied dance floor cuts meanwhile has stretched into less club orientated spheres hes produced experimental noise and industrial albums for opal tapes and hospital productions as well as the harsher horror spiked material he makes as shaped for his outlet then comes both as a reunion of sorts and a retrospective glance at the labels evolution so far following strict chronological order the collection begins with d s a track from s first record its a tough and menacing slow burner showing far more restraint than what the rest of the comp has in store its followed by a prime example of the subversive techno and d can come up with when they put their heads together all syncopated percussion and lopsided gait save for regiss gothy remix of s harden its the only time well hear a voice from the din s solo contribution landscapes is eerie and skulking when he turns his attention to the dance floor its always delightfully non conformist sees him team up with for another haunted industrial head nodder its too bridled to go all out but the looped drumming at the end will suck you in the second half of highlights records by artists outside s core three theres the whiplashed by which stands out as having some of the weirdest sound design here its in close competition with s hissing and the signature spitting on s but the pummeling speaker shredding drum work is what these guys do best evil and twisted up with whispers s track is also worth noting the comp concludes with an unreleased production from all three chiefs and which is as merciless as youd expect from the parties involved if this is a sign of the labels future then hold on tight

couldnt be a more suitable title for a ep: the londoner has a special command of drums that you might call crafty this brawny three-tracker for duskys label fits the description dealing in deftly executed percussive propulsion with hints of 2014s impressive pt 1 and are beat constructions encumbered by little more than steamy plumes and ghoulish hoover samples both tracks are considerable in size and bass weight but with zippy snares and hats piers sounds nimble as ever the title cut hearkens back to the acid flirtations of nukke 5two2 though it kicks the tempo up a notch and leans heavy on drums centered on a 303 bassline its the records most satisfying track even as it refuses to move anywhere but straight ahead piers pulls off enough rhythmic razzle-dazzle and knob-fiddling for each bar to feel progressively more dynamic is another well-crafted selection of vigorous house music thats modeled after its producers past successes
we know by now that sam shepherd is a master of long snaking grooves but did we know that it came so easy according to his friend four tet the london producer made while on the plane to the lyon festival of the same name he then mixed it down in the dj booth and played it to a receptive audience you probably wouldnt guess such a quick-and-dirty process could result in something like which is as smooth and well considered as any track is a memorable moment in an already incredible catalogue hearkening back to the peppy vacuum boogie it rides a squiggly acid lead that periodically explodes before receding into quieter passages taking its winding turns at high speeds its a bit like being thrown down a twisty waterslide but as thrilling as that sounds its all done in shepherds classy restrained manner at a more digestible six minutes is another exercise in discipline taking relatively big-room elements liberal use of reverb throbbing basslines snippets of vocals and horns and letting them stew rather than whipping up a commotion the best tracks are marked by that unfussy sense of arrangement so maybe it makes sense that shepherd could write an exceptional track like so quickly

by the time trapez released s in the in 2006 the production duo had already established their distinctive sound with a few releases on trapez and defrag recordings in the added to s small oeuvre with its signature oddball vocals and if you heard it rhymed its way into the collection of songs lodged in your head despite yourself not that this was a bad thing if we took at their word when they said they were concerned with recording special pieces of techno music inspired by basic questions of life and death then lyrics like i never heard about the fox in the box but i heard about the shit in the fridge added an existential layer of meaning to what may have seemed like just another charming but kooky little track fast forward two years from 2006 and the first set of remixes appeared on italys rebirth label luke solomon skylark and telespazio each took a turn remaking the tune into a dance floor stormer with tougher basslines while s own musical output slowed to a hush and two years later well we still dont know exactly what theyre up to except to say that has been resurrected by trapez ltd with another round of remixes of in the by christian salz c e s m and alex why two years is the magic number for this track is unclear but proton radios harry avers may have had a hand in this recent set or remixes (trapez thanks him specifically for having so much faith in the track ) latest mixes are a good deal tamer than the last mostly maintaining the relaxed vibe of the original christian s mix however is a grimy version you might expect from a member of the dirtybird family while cologne duo salzs -o-matic mix takes something away from that bouncing bassline to craft a rather ho-hum tech house track uks c e s m do their usual damage hatching an electro version while their compatriot alex delivers a solid tech house mix adding some fashionable conga drums to his version and highlighting the trippy frenetic vibe of the original
watch the low-key video for reginalds and you might feel a twinge of envy its basically just footage of los angeles (ron poznansky and dan terndrup) and their buddies fooling around house parties night drives backyard swimming pools modular synths bmx ramps fireworks sunrise on sunset boulevard the living looks pretty easy reginalds their debut single feels equally effortless bright ballooning chords bob over needle-nosed disco loops with perky synth counterpoints and a dogged funk bass to drive things forward the looped vocal (which might be dont you feel love but its hard to say) is vaguely reminiscent to some of the hot natured stuff but the production feels lusher the only quibble would be with the synth solo halfway through thats almost dangerously detuned; fortunately it never quite oversteps the bounds of good taste the three remixes stick pretty close to the source offering modest variations juan maclean takes the rock-tumbler approach tossing vocal loops and bright hard piano chords into a colorful churn; more prosaically its the 118 bpm version of a peak-time banger s bicep goes for a more muted vibe with deep swirling pads frothing ride cymbals and oodles of reverb; a bright bubbling acid line gives the tunes latter half some added oomph las classixx round out the set with what might be the best of the remixes a killer piano house distillation thats tougher and more stripped-down than the original but every bit as bliss-inducing
the future ep for public information saw ivo pacheco try his hand at conceptualism and though its conceit an ode to raves lost golden era felt a little laboured the music itself was his finest to date showcasing a scuffed widescreen sound built on arresting juxtapositions of sweetness and darkness if that ep was the portuguese producers after-hours record then for ramp is pitched directly at peak-time though its peak-time as heard through the fog of memory the excellent is tumbledown techno with an absurd edge (the choral samples that periodically rise to its scummy surface convey a garbled pomposity) the closing track deploys similar tools with a straighter face though judging by its descent from churchlike beauty to muffled rave chaos pachecos idea of a involves a soundsystem a forest clearing and a fiat punto full of drugs elsewhere we get the soundtrack to said morning and hardcore 94 are grotty anarchic bangers their finer details lost in wheezing surface noise and treacly synths is like pachecos best work both scuzzy and pretty but its pirouetting melody is once again almost suffocated by the layers of interference a technique which is faintly frustrating but intoxicating too
something of an oddity this one a genre-spanning ristolian supergroup which numbers drum bass berlord dj die futureboogies christoph and dubstep kingpin joker among its cadre make a note-perfect appropriation of early 80s electroboogie and disco in fact is so faithful you can almost hear the clack of the cuban heels as the musical protagonists strut around the studio are keen to stress that theres not a single sample in here; every roger troutman-style vocodered excerpt tinkling cowbell muted staccato guitar lick and funk keyboard stab is original material even dropped in alongside contemporary efforts from the norwegian disco mavens it stand outs such is its total commitment to keeping it real the package could perhaps do with a remix or two to offer something different although that may be missing the point somewhat this recreation is so forensic anything else would compromise the original premise
its safe to say that the chicken crew have senior status in the leftfield disco universe longtime starting-line act for the uk ear funk label the and the label deserve as much credit for stoking the fires of edgy weird disco-derived dance music as their perhaps better-known norwegian counterparts followers of ear funk would be understood however if theyve felt pangs of confusion when peeping the labels output as of late: the thrill of discovery and exploration has seemed to be on the wane with offerings starting to lean towards formula and calculation what had begun as a captivating combination of effervescent atmospheres and slow-mo rhythms has started to melt into loungey muzak such is the danger when a brand takes on a life of its own and creativity finds itself threatened by the fetters of other agendas thus the news that chicken have broken ground on their own label the cleverly christened is an occasion for finger-crossing in hopes that the chicken dance floor magic can enjoy a bit of a reboot on their inaugural label release the masquerade as zeefungk and the results are for the most part promising: the chicken sound is in full effect marrying crisp metallic live-kit to analog pulse and sizzle zeefungk offers up two robot parts the and the put these two organs next to each other however and the labials got an edge over the oracular the a-side feels a bit sluggish and rote the kind of track that mostly serves to make you wonder what the djs gonna drop next its not particularly clear what its doing in the opening slot especially when its flip-side counterpart is distinctly more engaging pops with a clave-led riff and descending hand-plucked boogie bass stir in some analog wiggle and synthetic sheen and youve got exactly the sort of loose-hipped android swagger thats been chicken stock in trade from the get-go too bad its stuck here bringing up the rear sandwiched in the middle of taken from the 2002 extended play album and appearing here in newly edited form is the easy standout: a floor-burner with low-slung live bass foregrounded hi-hats and a plethora of agitated squiggles and echo explosions so why when putting together their maiden release did the reach back to a seven year-old track lets hope its not for want of ideas but rather an appeal to the past designed to secure the future
like her labelmates the chromatics s debut 12 for the label is music built for night drives dark slow and disturbing its primed for you to be alone with your thoughts while listening a record that begins with a woman intoning in farsi my heart broke / it walks on water / the sun burns my eyes / my life left with you deserves no other venue s blank-eyed vocal inflection is part of it of course but italians co-label head johnny jewels exquisite production is just as important keeping things simple theres little more than an arpeggiator and a bass fart to its name which allows the two to lock into a hypnotic trance oblivious to everything around them afraid to die killing for their survival or at least thats what says theyre doing the italians name implies that what youre going to get is somehow related to italo disco yet its anything but the tempo hardly reaches into the triple digits instead italians here means the soundtrack work of goblin for horror director dario argento this is dread disco full of portent and prophetic dreams; a track thats perfect for your next halloween party
in early 2007 erlin s minimal m dchen m i released itters ss a fine techno lp (a rarity ) which was almost unanimously praised by critics for its fusion of the erlin and cologne sounds however the rigid consistency of aesthetic shown in that full-length was pointed to by some reviewers as a possible reason why the substatic co-founder hasn t achieved the recognition she deserves in this new release on m i strains against the ropes of uniformity with an exploration of new textures and ideas this is most apparent in dont a foreboding piece of stripped-down techno which finds m i s customary melodies replaced with scattered spoken-word vocals and a filtered siren squawking repeatedly in the foreground the most interesting part of this track comes in the form of pitch modulated chimes which rise and fall independently between the left and right sides of the stereo field and eventually disintegrate into the background in due time the vocals come echoing down the hall past the listener they inquire (to no one in particular) grim questions like do you want to die do you know what happened and of course the hugely important where s my cigarette on the surface the volley of questions appears to be disconnected thematically but it does contribute to an overall feeling of wickedness at hand side from its obvious mood-setting though ultimately dont serves as an academic exercise to influence the mind rather than the body provides a concrete counterpart to the ghost story of the -side lternating skillfully between deep and wobbly flavors of techno it shows its lush side with a lilting vocal that hearkens back to the good bits of mid-90s electronica it doesn t stay deep for long though; before reaching the two minute mark m i jumps deftly into a foray of experimental synthesis that would whip a crowd into a quick frenzy eventually things settle back tidily into the ample foundation of the track its m i at her best measuring each element to the whole in order to achieve a cohesive effect
once it was a rarity if not a recipe for disaster but in the last few years the idea of house and techno producers reinventing themselves as singer-songwriters has become common from james teej to matthew ear to james blake a whole sub-genre of j/producers are now showing a more indie-dance side this makes s left turn on less dramatic than it once would have been nonetheless the album makes a strong case for her right to mine that rich middle ground between club music indie and pop the chilean artists fifth album was three years in the making during which time studied jazz classical guitar and piano and thought presumably about how she might create something more in the vein of the bands she lists as inspirations in the press sheet such as mazzy star massive attack cocteau twins n the end is less grand ambitious and emotionally draining than what those influences might suggest the tone ranges from one of breezy summery melancholy (akin to adas meine zarten pfoten ) to the overcast dissatisfaction of ellen alliens ust naturally borrows from the dance floor ts tracks are underpinned with bumpy computerised bass texturally varied drums and tinate percussion all lifted straight from the post-minimal house music textbook t doesnt all work ( is a banal ambient reverie plays ineffectively with japanese scales) but s clear talent for song-structure not to mention her apparent love for surf and chiming 4a -style guitars means that her indie-dance hybrid impresses the limber purrs seductively full of clever detail sashays and twirls a winning excursion into jazzy tin electro however is the track that is most likely to transcend unfolding with an irresistible ease its as cool as the chromatics and in its middle-eight has a wonderfully sad guitar solo worthy of electronic-era johnny marr for there is clearly life beyond the dance floor
a glance through the back catalogue of s club lonely label gives a neat summary of his taste alongside his own work sol has released music from matrixxman innershades and alden tyrell producers inspired by classic chicago sounds and who prioritise simplicity and function this style works when it gets weird or aims for fist pumping intensity but more understated tracks often dont have the same punch this approach weakens the title track from s ep on its a raw acid workout and while the immaculate drums are sure to keep the club moving the glassy melodies never develop in a satisfying way is a blunt take on dub techno that lacks the genres signature attention to texture sol finds his footing on the b-side where a smooth bassline glides under the sleek detroit synths of but its only on the final track that he takes on the restrained frenzy of those old chicago classics and its the pick of the bunch built entirely from percussion concentrates everything sol knows about tension drum design and drama into a perfectly coiled trap ready to spring
like the rest of the clone jack for daze series adheres slavishly to the ideals of chicago and while this may not be the most limitless arena for clone founder serge verschuurs return apart from remixes hes been out of the production game for 15 years the duos three jack tracks prove sound examples of refinement pump-o-matic for example is built around just a single vocal sample and slick jabbing chords but the implementation of these ordinary elements is top-notch chopped into a solid rhythm of its own the truncated syllables of the pump it vocal begin to coalesce into other words perhaps hip-hop hip-hop it while the sharp chords always seem to be in the exact right places he eps t mix of is just as rudimentary pairing super-taut bass with an even shorter vocal snatch he bassline is an absolute killer casting an ominous and energetic shadow over the entire duration he eighty-nine mix tightens the strings on this bass even further providing a slightly brighter though no less intense version of the same track hough it may repeat history s robust arrangements keep things entertaining
has been part of the critical family since releasing binary which was very techy even by his standards then came biocellulose an album full of burnished dance floor slayers that had plenty for the hard-scene fans and neuro heads alike it deftly balanced mystical dream-like elements with snarling tear-outs keeping listeners on their toes on goes for a moodier sound atmospherics are pumped over the precision programming and crystalline percussion that define these tracks its admirable how cleanly the drum hits ricochet through the cinematic murk but theres something wrong theres a sense of melancholia in and feels fuggy but neither are convincing a collaboration with begins better before weirdly melting away in the middle perhaps the problem is that 006 lacks extremes its a little too tame compared to s previous records there are no sudden jolts or surprises only the feeling that things havent quite worked out
has already made a few ripples in the uk pond this year first with the self-released horizons ep and more recently with scattah his contribution to keysound llstars volume 2 those releases displayed a passing affiliation with garage but for the most part s musical concerns set him apart from his keysound-affiliated peers put simply this is down to his taste for uk hardcore which is particularly evident in his use of breakbeats an approach that recalls breakstep the mid-00s dubstep variant the ep for the young label continues in much the same vein these are methodical halftime rollers suffused with hardcores sonic paraphernalia translucent diva sighs re-pitched chords dubwise basslines and overlaid with a crusty coating of breakbeats is the best of the lot the chords creamiest the breaks funkiest elsewhere theres room for improvement feels a little sluggish while in the atmospherics sit oddly far back in the mix leaving the percussion somewhat exposed but each track still succeeds in taking an imaginative twist on a sadly neglected form proving to be a worthy successor to the likes of toasty and elemental
reckless with your love was pretty convincing proof that zari iii hadnt fluked their way into the brilliantly reimagined old school house of hungry for the power so when rumours began circulating that their third single was to revive the defining chicago house imprint trax records i rubbed my hands with glee location aside and despite their own protests that theyre not just chicago purists the duos debut one-two punch sounded like some of the defunct labels best moments donis mark imperial marshall jefferson the anthemic campiness of baby wants to ride were being channeled from beyond via their small toronto studio well that anticipated release date came and went trax is still dormant zari iii stayed north of the border and allegiances were shifted to tigas electro-inclined with a view to a forthcoming debut album while the lyrics of zari iiis previous singles have hinted at a quite desperate sense of alienation theyve been masked by the heady combination of starving yet fulls soprano and fritz helders growling spoken word ingido takes a different tack employing the two for little more than spectral moans and whispers relying on wordless reverb slow builds and repetition to provide both the dance floor groove and the intriguingly downcast mood a balancing act they manage to pull off between throbbing bass pulses skittering high hats and icy shards of synth melody occasional piano riffs provide both the tracks warehouse pedigree and its moments of uplifting respite vocalists are retired to the wings altogether for a b-side that the press release chirrups is a bit too full-on for the album it harkens back to the industrial gloom of manhooker and given the right setting would make for some acid-tech devastation but as a standalone is mechanically literal with sweeping scraping gonging industrial sounds increasing in measured increments over a similarly measured acid track dub mix of acknowledges ears that pricked up to the duos past releases with dueling motifs of a descending kick drum and ascending synth line isolated for a bit less mood and a bit more bounce overall may lack the immediate impact of zari iiis previous eps but danceable dystopia still rarely sounds this good
manchesters k ryan hunn is just one in a growing class of young uk producers alternating between crafting hip-hop and dubstep his latest effort is another addition to the latter of those two genres hosted by pinchs often dark and moody on hunn returns to the gritty industrial soundscape that was showcased on last years venture for 3024 slowly building intro gives way to a flurry of clanging percussion coupled with a string sample that will have the track sitting comfortably if dropped at the right time its however thats the highlight here stripped back and emotive the track is relatively short at just over three minutes in length but would be a nice addition to the tail end of a dubstep or future beat set the growling bass on display while not being much more than a short and straightforward loop mixes superbly with the intermittent vocals and digital keys the packages only remix helmed by indigo is solid but ultimately forgettable in the wake of hunns transfixing original
james holdens kinda-floor-focused-kinda-not imprint has been sticking to its guns since 2003 keeping one foot in dance music while letting its other one tap around in experimental electronics synthesizer meanderings and pretty much whatever other textures suit holdens fancy visually represented by a comically pastoral scene replete with windmills and rainbows scrolling by at the bottom of its website is a kind of utopia for sounds you cant imagine finding their day in the sun anyplace else every so often though the community lobs a hit at us from behind the walls of their commune and a new club-ready mix of s first featured on his holkham drones album from 2010 is their latest transmission to enter our airspace trance-disco trance-kosmische trance-trance could be any of these things honestly depending on your mood and the time of day smoothing out the originals shuffle into sure-footed 4/4 abbott puffs out the chest of his nerdily epic chords (the original mix which also features here sounds pretty withdrawn by comparison ) whether its newfound sense of ambition and grandness of scale translates into progressive may be a matter of personal preference but its big sound palate certainly feels of the moment dives without fear into maximalism its the lesser club track if only because it doesnt benefit from s adventurous melody gold and etienne turn in remixes on the flip with the former sculpting out most of the originals bombast and the latter amplifying its krautrock tendencies
ex released in june last year was the patchy live album based on a performance at new yorks guggenheim museum that became richie hawtins first new material in over ten years its not a great surprise given hawtins exalted status that on this largely successful remix package the contributors only lightly alter the source material their reverence largely pays dividends though with three of the four reworks improving on the original tracks the exception is the tale remix of the listless piano lines and atmospheric touches are at best uninspired and at worst phoned-in dixon is much more successful with his version of which simply adds heftier kicks to the originals huge orchestral sweeps and shaves a couple of minutes off the runtime elsewhere recondite applies a similarly light touch to taking a little off the originals length and adding subtle drama to the keys and drums dubfire the least zeitgeisty of the remixers finishes the package on a high with a 13-minute take on he removes the originals intro-track feel by beginning with a high-intensity bassline which is retained even as he settles into a pattern of wonderfully hypnotic keys
annual compilation is as firmly linked to summers slow buzzy burn as overheated engines and road construction delays in preparation for the approaching ibiza season the assembly serves as a potential showcase for the kind of deep psychedelic techno labelhead sven vath foresees in heavy wee hour rotation and by this point its pretty hard to second guess the man; vath as well as any promoter/producer/mega seems to sense the pulse of ibizas sonic dementia for the labels tenth annual installment j hes turned to many faces associated with the imprint including fire and longtime ibiza reveler but with contributions from established producers not typically linked to the frankfurt label like du and von from the surface j s tracklist is arguably as intriguing as any since the series infancy distancing itself from what was a slightly more house oriented collection last year j returns to the dark hued strident techno that made the brand a decade ago opening with the lumbering bass and ornamental synth patterns of von s excellent sinuous for many likely to be the biggest draw here the compilation sets its dead of night tone right from the outset; its one matched by the mesmeric bounce of s the clanging bells and dizzy synth pulses of fires hedonistic or the black moon melody and harsh dissonance of s bel newbie s hypnotic bit of damaged vocal techno is particularly exceptional elsewhere j tracks disorientation through oddity s trademarked vocal play on made to sound almost like a hiccup here layered into stuttering rhythms foregrounds trills of some tribal flute like instrument and the sudden noisy blurt of a broken horn its busted jumbled completely out of rhythm and yet marked by s ability to make the willfully bizarre sound so immediate another strange headfuck if more minimally dosed submerges you in whirring drones and brief waves of static before a wintry tonal melody emerges from the sonic surf like much of his work in its sonic intricacy is a carefully crafted detour both intimate and somewhat withdrawn offering up its surface secrets without divulging its greater truths in fact even if du and turn in unimaginative retreads of past successes alone would demand sliding j into the collection alongside the runs better editions but is surrounded by mostly sure handed productions here by vets and rooks alike whether or not it predicts ibiza heavies is ultimately immaterial; j should get plenty of spins in the sanctity of your air conditioned apartment
progcity s latest offering is a collaboration from spains dj ino and jesus featuring a mix from detroits kris the original cut is pretty typical progcity fodder; it covers a lot of bases not reaching any depths and plays it very safe a contending cut for the likes of pete tongs c show the remixes are where its at on s mix takes the original and makes it work for the heads its stripped back and uses the elements intelligently the pads ease you along with warmth and soul while delicate touches of delay and reverb give a great impression of madrids deep hypnotic late night vibe kris s remix is a lovely contrast to s this is perhaps progcitys effort to break their mould slightly and fulfills that brief with a more detroit-centric take he does a good job of giving this cut a nice raw bounce while managing to maintain the delicate ethereal moments of the original may not have the individuality of many releases but as a remix effort its top class
at about the time that i was discussing a new interest in lower tempos on our 2016 in review roundtable milo bragg was recording a mix called slow tracks volume i starting with halftime dubstep and crawling towards 110 bpm it explored the spaces and intensities opened up by these sluggish speeds the second record on braggs label furthers the enquiry with the curatorial flair bragg is making his trademark (the first fp release was a neat pair of 90s leo anibaldi tracks ) sourced from three artists of different ages and origins is cool and nocturnal with a sinister opiated undertow the record opens calmly with a track from wolfgang voigt as that initially appeared in 1995 its solemn dub techno decelerated to 83 bpm a tempo all the better to meditate on its swirling motion its orderly 4/4 pulse suggests faith in divine dub techno providence while on the b side two tracks from murcof are more agnostic sourced from 2004s album an exploration of traditional dance sounds from the producers native mexico both tracks are skittish balls of hand percussion smoky hi hats and darkside chillout synths builds an almost epic momentum over nine odd minutes is humbler and somehow more unsettling the eps outlier comes in the middle the gorgeous is from the same era as the voigt production the archival 2014 cassette on which it first appeared was called unearthed tracks 1992 1995 but it belies welshman s interest in a different electronica pioneer: the tinny pads nagging melancholy and downtempo shuffle suggest a bedroom study of aphex twin like the other tracks here it was hardly inaccessible before this reissue but bragg has brought it into a rewarding new context
oth tracks from mystery producer s debut for are playful if not a little novice but sometimes even naivete can be charming gallops on a steady slightly syncopated beat making use of exaggerated sound effects that dip tug and snap back each bar tipping over into an extended drum fill whose gleeful novelty never quite wears off leaning more towards techno hops on one foot with its jagged beat almost straightened out by the hi-hat but the tracks focus quickly turns elsewhere is all about the synth chords which pulse softly in slow-mo strobelight fashion splaying themselves in a chrome-plated mess across the track its that particular bassline that remains one of the most memorable parts of the track that and a murmuring vocal sample that constantly lurks beneath the surface betray an outside influence a producer attacking techno from a different angle however it seems like these little tidbits need to bubble up and emerge because as it stands theyre tiny splotches of bright colour on an otherwise stark white canvas theres a spark buried somewhere in here but it doesnt quite come to the surface on
its fitting that l i e s 100 comes from an artist whos been synonymous with the label from the start in interviews ron morelli the labels founder has given a simple answer as to why he started the label: his friends were making great tracks that wouldnt have otherwise come out these days though l i e s draws from a wider pool of artists than the hardware-oriented scene in early 10s brooklyn morelli is now based in paris and djs around the world nearly every weekend tsuzing from china and ngly from argentina have released key albums on the label but l i e s continues on post-hype with roughly the same mo to support the endeavours of dance music misfits has used this platform to construct a shadowy evocative world that snaps into focus on so what makes so special for starters he takes his time even in the midst of l i e s s busiest years the label put out more than 50 records over 2013 and 2014 real name matt gardner has limited himself to at most a yearly check-in and a few remixes or collaborations despite this limited output hes produced several enduring cuts both tracks from his 2011 debut 12-inch damn / pf pf pass amaze from 2013s yyyyyyyyyy ep and wav2 from the digital-only ( ) to name a few each of those tracks introduced a slightly different sound world pieces of a puzzle completed by combines the spectral soul sampling that defined amaze with the head-down dream house sound of pf pf pass the new age ambience heard on ( ) is felt here in more subtle ways for instance bears much in common with dub techno yet he sidesteps the genres confines with a loose arrangement and chord clusters that hint at ambient musics beatific stasis theres also an uncommon musicality at play here a lilting piano solo sneaks in early on a track on which the toms dont pound so much as drip on the intro gardner builds up a wall of hand-played rhodes parts breezily improvising a conversation with himself the albums only ambient interlude sounds like the intro for an og tech house gem as reimagined by gas many artists might have run with just one of these ideas for an entire lp but gardner floats from one style to another while only sounding like himself
terence fixmers first proper ep for might be this years quintessential klubnacht record those familiar with the berghain party will agree that the best sets there are excursive with a narrative thats part of a wider overall arc y have peaks lulls hooks and glorious curveballs all of which feature on title track is both inviting and unnerving entrancing with its shadowy embrace before it strikes out with a moaning synth line it finds a masterful balance: progressive and distinct functional but skewed just enough has an updated retro hook twittering acid and bleepy notes collide with a breathy vocal that nods to fixmers love for ebm this one sounds even more disturbed and yet weirdly bright and celestial for those looking to play it safer is a hypnotic lull thats no less essential ends the ep by showing off fixmers brighter side with the exception of his when sun track for electric deluxe hes rarely sounded so balmy and the pan pipes for that matter have rarely sounded so wonderfully contorted
kortrijk is the place is the er crew is for those who can is the motto and on the evidence of this they may have a point while the influences might be current the two tracks here owe a debt to the sun-drenched libidinous sound of hot natured et al the tears for fears-like vocal takes each to a different place theres a choral feel to this pair which seems destined to fill vast spaces a possibility maybe acknowledged by the releases artwork which features a stained glass window over a crucifix in a corner of the house of god variety isnt this eps strong point mid-paced kicks haunting synths and hand claps dominate but the vocals leave the most lasting impression which allied with some subtle flourishes elevate this release beyond most similar fare
according to discogs its been a decade since aroy dee has used the moniker m gt;o gt;s while the reasons behind the projects revival may be unclear dees trademark sense of melancholy continues to shine through on this debut release for steffis imprint it is however subtly different from recent 12-inches under his birth name theres a futuristic or perhaps retro-futuristic sheen that wasnt so obvious before best exemplifies this channelling a dreary blade runner -type mood via piercing pads and rubbery bass chords their presence is near-constant so unusually its the percussion which ebbs and flows rather than the melody constantly pulsing in volume trembling hats and clusters of barking claps impart a chaotic sense of rhythm it almost sounds like a grittier and less dramatic version of steve moores beyond tykens rift in monolithic kicks and claps stretch upwards like skyscrapers dees chords roiling around their bases as if a sweeping city-wide fog naturally the details are obscured under this cover with several discrete synth lines converging into a larger and more emotive mass marcel s remix distills these elements down to a precise elegant slice of techno the berghain resident wouldnt seem the most obvious remixer in this case but his old-school-inspired effort feels entirely natural though the foggy chords are much the same s raspy percs thrust continually through them like a speeding train is the most introspective of the bunch making room for long tails of reverb amongst its fuzzy winding synths and tough snare strikes its also the hookiest sad bloops and bleeps plod across its surface feeling wistful in that particular aroy dee way
phil jason (aka jas legend of talking dog) has really established his name in the last year or two exploding onto the scene with the brilliant carnival house ep he follows up his impressive hitchiking release on hooj to grace the label with more of his musical presence this time under his talking dog persona has a more funky appeal than his previous work on the a-side of disc one is the mr velcro fastener remix it begins with a nicely arranged drum loop and some smooth subtle strings in the background as the track progresses the vocal line plays a vital part as do the electro squeaks and subtle bleeps that all merge beautifully with the drums the smooth strings then return and take the track to another level it has a smooth electro feel to it without trying to do too much solid production yet again from the velcro man on the flip is the ever reliable red jerry disco dog remix for the hooj fans out there many should know what to expect from the head honcho the baseline is the key ingredient with this mix as it takes a deep electro groove route the vocal gains some filtering amongst the sounds that ride in and out of the production with consummate ease and effectiveness its another brilliant remix from rj and should definitely appeal to many the original mix is on the a-side of disc two a more conventional 4/4 drum pattern is used here as the vocal fades in and out early in the track the baseline comes into effect early as does the sample effects that ride in and out around the vocals on most part the track maintains a smooth flow accompanied with a short breakdown deep into the track that sees the vocal explode into the beats that come back in with force on the flip is the mr velcro fastener instrumental essentially it is the remix on disc one without the vocals however hearing this production without the vocal is very impressive the subtle electro melodies gain importance as does the soothing strings throughout the track it has a great flow to it and should be a welcome addition for those that may dislike the vocals after the velcro dub comes a dj tool in the form of an accapella snippets of the vocal are cut up and may come in handy for those with ideas of accapellas another solid release from hooj and a young american producer that goes from strength to strength
until recently a hook-up between these two might have raised a few eyebrows but shows just how far bicep have come since tripper came out last year with the somewhat tiresome accusations of them rehashing 90s house now reduced to a murmur this collaboration with the ever-reliable simian mobile disco should hopefully dispel the allegations for good the result of a jam session at smds london studios recorded straight to analogue tape unfurls over almost nine minutes with piercing 909 handclaps juddering bass synths and a nagging two-note refrain there was a time when every ep had an ambient or beatless version in order to gain a foothold in the chillout market smd bicep revive the practice in some style with a remix ( 1 ) that works as a dj tool but its 2 thats the real star setting the tape speed to 7 5 inches per second (most professional decks record at around 15 or 30) it turns the original into a blissed-out slow-moving jam of fuggy synths and heavy narcotic drone
at their best sound like autechre staggering drunk into a bar and knocking over furniture captures this image to a tee: the groove barely holds itself together as it reels around unruly slaps of snare while curiously tinted melodic scales clatter down a set of crotales like an inebriate down a flight of stairs is even more off kilter lumbering chaotically around arpeggios and skittering noise ever since 2012s geotope peter van hoesen and yves de mey have brought out the best in each other their recent collaborations have made more coherent techno sound staid even if it means risking abuse from techno happy festival crowds that said s side of will surely get more airtime on dance floors theres a satisfying tactile snarl to the attack envelope of s central synth it feels like theyve got the hardware jacked directly into the soundsystem as the filter edges open burrowing deeper into the wormhole wisps of reversed reverb offset the percolating churn of synths could function as a set opener or tense bridge builder thanks to its stately kick pattern the squirming multilayered figure that starts the track is the most interesting part and one cant help but wish this weird impulse was the basis for a wackier finale
nico jacobsen aka houndcales gives the distinct impression that hes on a mission to tear shit up evidence the brooklyn-based producer calling his brand of complex and exciting techno junta rave and a track ( ) that he says came about after deciding that kate bushs delius would sound better if it were assembled of harmonies and rhythms distilled from dirt-covered dog growls sabbath lillie hawks sees jacobsen who is one of the guys behind former ra label of the month fifth wall turn out three crushing molten techno tracks for lush chords may usher in but tough kicks swiftly offer a counter-balance the junglist influences that jacobsen says have been key to his development coming through in the screeching vocal loop and frequent percussive bursts the title to is a clue to its contents a dark shadowy display of industrial might its beats hammer away like a steel press meanwhile is an express-paced collision of jackboot tempo and clattering african drums you suspect brit techno champs forward see a kindred spirit in jacobsen they contort the basslines on into wild shapes and attack it with laser bursts laying it on top of a jerky discomforting rhythm whichever way you turn on this ep youre confronted with intrigue and innovation

forgive travis stewart and praveen sharma for biding time as with that time-honored holding pattern an ep of remixes by others as machinedrum stewart is responsible for one of s defining albums ; as braille sharma has made one of the years best singles so theyve been busy and anyway the shivering tendrils of sound the two put together for last falls ep offer plenty to pick up and carry to new places much of the time the remixers keep the atmosphere from the tracks and leaven them with heavier bottom end itself gets relicked thrice (one digital-only) and in each case the soulful male vocal sample whoa taking me is recast in a more concrete structure than stewart and sharmas free-floating original torontos xi stays close to s template but concentrates more on the low end as well as a g-funk synth whine whose notes sound like theyre stretching in front of you fellow new yorker faltydl lays down a broken-beat bottom and flits the original in and out over the top of it i realize thats reductive as hell but thats what it sounds like (not a complaint either) lando of lazer sword does digital-only honors with a clean-lined stop-start dubstep-then-not mix that falls right in line the de-swagging he recently told the quietus hes been trying out recently jimmy s version of of is structurally similar to the faltydl bouncing bass (with clicky stick percussion) as bed for the title phrase cut and spliced daedeluss version of is cluttered mostly but it does contain a brief cloud-break when a breakbeat enters first at jungle speed then at hip-hop
seem in constant discovery of their musics dance floor potential the new york-based duo of sam haar and zach steinman two art school grads without much club exposure were at first interested in the effects of repetition even while using hardware instead of live instruments seemed more like a band than a dance music act but records for rvng intl revealed constructions centered on long builds immersive textures and emotionally swelling peaks with more emphasis on drums 2013s swisher was the spark that transformed their music into full-blown techno latest album contains some of their hardest work yet swisher already seemed big but by boosting the drums and reducing the textures by a hair has considerably more horsepower for example thickens in mass like a thundercloud with techno kicks that speed into the eye of the storm the brooding pounds among hissy percussion and blasts of distortion on anxiety overtakes the low-end throbs menacingly the synths erupt in paranoid loops have never sounded so severe but is not all dark and twisted some of its finest ideas are built on what weve heard from all along dense gorgeous layers of texture soars high but stays soft with glitchy sequences cradled in poignant chords a pulse of polyrhythmic synth and bell tones ushers in cascading waves of calm the rippling voices on recall earlier tracks like wine but the track is stripped down to a just few dreamy elements its voices left to shimmer against the mist the music on is among the duos most powerful and several tracks from the lp could come alive in the right kind of dj set but given the way the rhythms and textures unfurl its still more exciting to imagine these pieces in the context of improvisatory live shows the music on will lift such occasions to new heights
since his move to berlin and heightened dj profile detroits has come to symbolise electros new lease of life the urban tribe member is described as a massive influence on the music of the glaswegian third of copenhagens apeiron crew her debut solo release which launches the in-house label from the glasgow club la cheetah makes you believe it her tracks are noxious and sharp full of scything drum work and ominous sound design the major difference between and is speed as demonstrates on his remix of hes not afraid to accelerate beyond the reach of most contemporary techno djs in this case 140 bpm is necessary to bind together the tracks vivid but disjointed sound effects blake stays in the 130 bpm range and her tracks suffer a little for it is the best its duck-diving hi-hats and hi-tension kick drum helping crank up the funk it also has the eps best non-melody an ugly smear of pitch-bent lead tones the title track could do with more compelling development its semitonal bassline lingers a bit too long and the hi-end squeals that work as a countermelody dont quite pull their weight wedged in between is a spooky palate-cleanser four-and-a-half minutes of morse code bleeps and dissonant pad clusters
isnt what youd call an album artist thats not a slight against him but rather a reflection of his career thus far since disbanding his hot city project in 2011 rupert cogan has been on a prolific tear of 12-inches mixtapes and digital one-offs that celebrate a decidedly unsubtle approach to throwback house music thing was ever off the menu garage breaks ghetto house rave and every permutation therein could appear on any given release and cogan tested the limits of those styles with single after rough-and-ready single sure they werent all great (some were downright ridiculous ) but theyd inject any dj set with jacking old-school flair with rinses release of burnin p you have to wonder what exactly cogans debut full-length is meant to accomplish its essentially more of the same from an artist whos released a shitload already and it certainly doesnt attempt any kind of narrative or cohesive structure importantly these tracks are not among his best one of the bigger tunes here taps into the kind of pent-up bottom-heavy garage shuffle that moscas done wrong unleashed in 2011 though it lacks the graceful tenacity and slinky movements despite some sloppy arranging delivers feisty jacking rhythms with its booming percussion and dopey bassline and and hold their own as unflashy acid bangers but theres really no overall highlight no needin cold as ice or trumpet badman and that makes for a tracklist with far too much filler little of what burnin p does is exciting but none of it is necessarily bad as with much of his work cogan consistently strikes a solid middle ground between guilty pleasure cheeky nostalgia and bonafide killer a sinewy drum track like werkin has the good sense to throw a few rave stabs into the mix and while and stick to the house rulebook they do so with enough energy to be convincing cogan deserves credit for the mileage hes able to get out of classic dance music even if he cant turn it all into a strong album
finally completing his vasco ep some three months after the release of part 1 seems to have aimed a bit lower on the second part than on the first not only is there half as much music present part 1 was a double pack but the lone track isnt nearly the masterful work that both minimoonstar and electonic water were (to say nothing of the astounding shackleton remix of the former) still a very good villalobos track is better than what most producers can hope for on their best day unfortunately weve all taken to expecting the world from him and in that respect this release is ultimately a bit of a disappointment the sure-to-be-perpetually-misspelled mazordum is the lone star of the show here both in original and baby remix versions the original mix is basically villalobos showing us all his favorite party trick for the umpteenth time; layer upon layer of uptempo micro- and macro-percussion some jazzy keyboards that eventually wander off of the record entirely before the whole thing morphs into a sizzling percussion workout for the last third not even remotely resembling where we started its still amazing and no one else can do it the same way but it loses its jaw-dropping thrill after so many showings baby s version works a bed of bleeps bubbles pops and clicks under a long looped section of the originals keyboard ramblings for a late-night journey through the city sans headlights when the clipped hi-hats are deployed a few minutes in they provide the only light for miles when vasco is assembled in full on the forthcoming cd version complete with the full 30-plus minute take of minimoonstar and one track not heard on either vinyl ep the complete picture will certainly be better for having mazordum as part of it; it is exactly the kind of track that adds texture and depth to a full-length effort but as a standalone it isnt up there with villalobos very finest work though it is indeed fine work by any measurable standard
polish duo karol xvii mb valence are prolific producers and remixers but plastic ge feels like sound of m hitting ir stride charge is led by round with subtle vintage rhodes offset by bubbling bass synths and in background an e real digital hum on shuddering moogs trembling bass and clipped guitars collide but releases star turn is its a rattling house stomp blasted with eerie analogue keys and dragged along by classic donis-like synth throbs such is its confident strut you could easily breakdance to it; that it threatens to go completely unhinged at any moment only adds to drama
something tells me that its simply the pleasant little synth line in thats got it rolling around in my head incessantly over the past week but sometimes thats enough while charts her love of electronic music all the way back to castlemorton its safe to say her music is bitten by the tech house bug: crackles with ableton sound design but is guided by rounded beats and a healthy love of melody comparisons to someone like m i a sub static not xl are unavoidable but that may be down to the fact that both use emotionless vocals to temper the emotionality present in the music dub mines that contrast for all its worth in his remix pitting the two against one another in a solid if unmemorable remix whose biggest moment comes from a wet repeating synth that punctuates things alex on the other hand brings things down to smolder for ten minutes content with open spaces and a slow build to no real end to be honest im content with it too for the digital fans in the crowd johnny turns up with a suitably non-descript take which checks off the driving and tech house boxes and doesnt seem to concern itself with much else complaints could be made i suppose but each remix features that aforementioned melody and you certainly cant blame them for that hooks like this one are hard to ignore

rguably the most hyped release of the year so far news of urial and four tets collaboration spread like wildfire through internet forums and blogs when it first appeared on record release sheets back in march the first chance to pre-order the record also compounded excitement and anticipation due to the announcement that there would be no cover art no audio promos and no audio samples to attempt to judge if the record could live up to expectations first up is which doesnt even seem to have any trace of the spectral garage producer until the beat crashes in more than two minutes into the track hebden slowly builds up a wall of chiming sounds with melodic triplets sitting atop sustained bass tones and swooping eastern melodies before giving way to a tense but restrained synthetic arpeggio its at this point that things calm to near silence before the listener is ambushed by urials trademark 2-step percussion with loose woodblocks and hi-hats taking a detour into darkness before the original elements are slowly teased back into the mix along with yet another urial staple: the undecipherable affected vocal rdent urial fans may be slightly disappointed that the beat seemingly his main contribution to the track is actually just cut straight from his unreleased rcheron track but on the other hand its a major nod to the urial sound that his followers have come to know and love on the release and will hence be the choice cut for dubstep djs whereas sounds like it was cobbled together from parts sent back and forth between the two you get the feeling that is something that the duo sat down and produced together and the results sound much more complete as a result loping along at a restrained 123bpm the 2-step skip is still there but in a much more rigid form as smooth melodic synths judder and swell throughout the most obvious reference point for the prodding funky melody lines are the kompakt and order community stables circa 2004 albeit with a slightly more refined touch things boil down to just the percussion halfway through with subtle reverb added to the kick and a plinky arpeggio but when the melody returns (this time accompanied with another affected vocal) it marks a moment of real emotive impact one that should have just as much clout as an end of night anthem in the club as it will riding the night bus home with the sun peeking over the horizon word has it that the two producers are planning on releasing more material together so if my assumptions are correct it seems like a more interactive collaborative approach will yield even better results going forward
theres been a lot of hype surrounding the debut album from tahliah barnett better known as shes only released two eps until now but her rise to something approaching pop-stardom has been fierce and unstoppable a seriously considered image has helped barnett has been on the covers of i-d dazed and the fader already and her music videos have more or less gone viral but its the music itself that really makes her stand out amongst her peers in contemporary r b her second ep in particular which was produced in part by arca showcased a stripped back raw and futuristic vision of pop music if you heard barnetts previous releases youll know more or less what to expect here stark often detuned synthesizers swell in and out and awkward bass grumbles complement sparse percussive rolls barnett started her career as a backing dancer for acts such as jessie j and it shows the album utilizes tropes of various scenes trap-like percussion heavily chopped and manipulated vocals to create something that is more akin to the music that might soundtrack a contemporary dance piece each beat is a potential accent to a bold and deliberate movement its worth noting that while other producers had a hand in various tracks barnett produced much of the album and reportedly nothing was written without her present you can tell this certainly isnt an album thats been ruined by committee it feels like a singular vision this is hardly surprising given the label behind it intelligent but accessible pop music is fast becoming stock-in-trade her production style sets barnett apart and her distinctive look means her face stands out on billboards but her voice is no doubt the real star here it almost seems odd for someone with such an absurdly strong image and such a considered presence to have such hauntingly fragile voice lyrically the songs paint a picture of barnett with a similar duality sometimes it seems shes hurt and insecure seemingly defined by her relationships at other times such as on the lead single shes a more confident and determined character a mile away from the anxious and apprehensive lover in her delivery throughout the album never feels anything less than utterly sincere both haunting and charming it really is one of the most emotive performances weve heard in quite some time when i first heard part of me was slightly disappointed n her two earlier eps it didnt seem unreasonable to expect the album to come from far out in left-field like a transmission from a pop station in a distant future is a little more straightforward than that the pop influences are more audible and the whole thing feels a little more familiar but i realised after a few listens that this is hardly a bad thing in the end is probably the most singular pop album of the year its testament to how emotionally affecting one persons realised vision can be
those hoping for a romping new hi-nrg direction from will be disappointed may sound like a 70s new york gay bar but it actually refers explains mayer to his fascination with historys great madcap explorers: characters obsessed with an idea to totally wrong conceptions of the world and faulty sea charts to inconceivable exertions all that lunacy does mayer see himself as a fellow-traveller sonically producer following his own perhaps nd with some validity if youve been following the story thus far then will sound familiar; keen students will spot sonic signatures over a rockabilly rhythm the giddy was a reuses the dramatic morricone-esque xylophones that were a hallmark of the supermayer album and makes full jolly play of the relentless almost cheesy brass that has latterly become a feature of the sound that such motifs arent new barely matters mayer continues to use them in unique counter-intuitive ways and is a significant elaboration on the modern aesthetic if the recent total compilations have at times sounded like a grab bag of glib experiments here mayer weaves all those strands together in a remarkably cohesive work for the most part is a serious record that confidently takes its own sweet time the beats dont fully kick-in until after the seventh track s on his immer mixes mayer is more interested in creating the right meditative mood than in going for the dance floor jugular is sweltering and intense like lindstrom contemplating the stars in an mazonian jungle clearing likewise all space odyssey sound palette and brass figures encourages reverie rather than movement despite its propulsive breakbeat the title tracks galloping viewlexx-style italo homage ups the tempo but and the beautiful ease deliciously down through the gears ll bells harps birdsong and mournful woodwind could be a lost track from bjorks debut techno purists by now gnashing their teeth at all this sweet musicality rest assured mayer can still rock the haus and the more frivolous (a strange hybrid of high-voltage pitchbent electro and handbag house bass patterns) are hard rubbery tracks pulsating with the promise of delirious moments in dark rooms the anthem however is saved for last featuring jeppe kjellberg of whomadewho on vocals sounds like a cece rogers chicago house classic as reinterpreted by hip european music geeks n anti-materialist paean to the more precious business of dancing it is nothing less than a promised land for high praise but then demands such superlatives
one consequence of s becoming an ever-more-assured album artist is that her aim tends to be increasingly interior so hearing her fleshed out for the floor by folks who live there has a push of its own these three cuts from the longer remix project boil things down nicely the original is a moody electro-lined whispered (not quite sung) piece that hooks on what sounds like a treated woodwind rippertons version reworks that woodwinds earthier resonances thanks to its dabs of dawn-coming-up synth and a descending-tom-tom figure that accompanies the heavy disco thump at every turn the bass drone in this company even feels somewhat organic even though it clearly isnt camea of the micro-minimal label clink goes the other way with her treatment of lliens version starts out as a fizzy disco loop and then gradually frizzles into other directions; camea opts for spacey techno with a dreamy central synth figure and nicely deployed percussion effects was a dust bonus track and a b-side on the our utopie ep (its also on the city sound berlin comp from late last year where it transfers rather nicely to a now -style hits format ) its a fingers inc -style instrumental that builds to a heavily phased and pitch-shifted burst of vocal snippets then settles into a stomping synth arpeggio shonkys remix gives it a black-lit fluorescent sense: everything from the synth-bass (played fast to rise gradually) to the droplets of crisp percussion to ghost-like vocal drops seems to be shivering and standing still at the same time
franck rogers real tone label has long been delivering streamlined deep house where the genius lies in well-executed simplicity rather than a streak of ambition (see maya jane coles what y say ) his own productions arent all that different and though r s nick connellan came down on his last collaboration with mandel turner for just that reason on his newest the familiarity works mostly in its favour the indeed has a bit of a methodical box-ticking dimension but its all wrapped up in a package so glossy that any criticism you might throw at it would just slide off the slick surface with its chest-beating yet subtle riff just-so weightless drums and effortlessly smooth vocal (not to mention the hilarious spoken word monologue) its the kind of thing youd imagine soundtracking an early morning house session little too standard to get terribly excited about its nevertheless a track that could be a highlight of a set if placed in the right context here it comes in both a vocal and a dub version and while turners performance is your standard deep house crooner the dub shows off rogers inimitable ear for hooks particularly the slip-sliding chords that wreath the verses
now residing in berlin is a techno dj and producer from belfast where he was a resident with the dsnt crew last year he set up a label through which he released his debut ep the veil of thoughts it was a promising first effort and follow-up is even better like the veil of thoughts this ep comprises four chugging techno tracks each anchored by a booming kick drum but these are more subtle productions and with their airy string-like sustained tones both have an exotic touch not often heard in techno the longform is a smooth atmospheric cut while is a heads-down track with jagged percussion and trippy flanging effects stronger stuff is on the flip and counts as s most potent track to date a stripped-down and perfectly no-nonsense dj tool it packs a couple monochrome riffs that grind in and out of sync as a sparse metallic rattle gradually rises into the mix still id say the best is saved for last is a classy broken-beat cut with cascading chords that sound both retro and futuristic it should be interesting to see where goes next
is italian producer massimiliano vianello who debuted his odd house and techno on delsin in 2011 and inaugurated the label two years ago both of those records were psychedelic affairs with chirruping backgrounds filtered voices and off-kilter drums his follow-up for 100 is a rewarding and varied listen that sits between his hazy material and the hard-edged knife silhouette 12-inch from this year on the title track balearic overtones evoke his earliest work and its the most purely enjoyable cut to boot its synth line could be taken from a percussions track: the pitched-down melody takes on a seasick quality like the accordions on oflynns desmonds empire darker textures prevail elsewhere with and base grinding and swaying apocalyptically is as sleazy as you might imagine a hail of breakneck ebm arps and frenzied heavy breathing the track is enjoyably silly but not the records high point the digital-only the rounds out s strong ep with a beautiful wash of glinting pads soft twittering and barely-there beats
the combo of ben camp and mat leutwyler return in the mr horowitz ep on silver planet s sister label the release features the title track which was used to great devastation by nick warren on his latest global underground release mr horowitz is quite a fantastic production from the word go the beats have good purpose and intensity building the track with some crisp claps and quirky patterns soon enough the nicely formulated synths come into the track leading into the main melodic patterns that are quite spine tingling to say the least it is a stunning production and one of the highlights of the year so far more is quite a short production but it gets straight to the point with some tough electro basslines and eerie melodies despite its short length it has a good flow and an intriguing nature way out west remix mr horowitz and turn in another solid reworking performance they use a pulsating electro bassline building the track as well as a trademark wow melodic pattern not to mention the trademark wow energy and brilliance in arrangement a very solid reworking from nick and jody last of all is trubbel the quirkiest production of the lot the feel of the track is quite smooth with the pads and subtle basslines in the background however it is the acid lines and subtle eerie melodies that make this another interesting production by the duo another must buy release from this ever reliable duo check it out at all costs
there are two obvious things about the first is the way it hews closely to pop dogmas: structures (verse verse chorus middle eight) functional drums three-note bass carrying a basic chord sequence esoteric lyrics its done flawlessly were lifted up and laid down at all the right points and thereby made receptive to the second thing and thats its unashamedly lush soaring open-heartedness a sparkling synthesiser line rather than guitar separates it from the similarly halcyon likes of 1979 by the smashing pumpkins but its not so much a nod to this type of mid-90s alt-rock as much as it revels in it through specs made of brand new rose-tinted crystal his fascination mix does a similar thing this time sitting dewy-eyed alongside the likes of m83 with whooping my bloody valentine overlays delivering unrestrained joy on slow pressure release the baumel mix is essentially a well-executed translation for the club keeping the emotion of the original and ending up epic and respectable in a way that james lavelle might take to melons comes down harder with the kicks but the fuzzy two-chord hook and pad make it more of a laidback shuffle these dance mixes make the whole package feel like a pop single clear formula familiar effortlessly consumable but whereas pops chief goal is often to make money theres no sense of that whatsoever here the only thing this record wants is for you to feel good it makes all the difference
the newly formed imprint has had no trouble finding its feet credit for that is due to elgian techno producer who is currently in the midst of a remarkable run of singles pvh continues his winning streak here with the sort of thing he does best: no nonsense stripped back techno with tinges of a dub influence of trips along with only a few notes of respite from the relentless devotion to the quick 130 pm pace van hoesen allows the frame of the track to shudder giving off the impression that its about to break apart at any moment he utilizes the same sort of idea with albeit in slower form taking in a globular bassline that works nicely against the dubby textures the interaction is lovely and pvh stretches it out to eight minutes lengthening and shortening each element so that their conversation remains fresh it like its predecessor on the -side is minimal but in the best possible way redefining what that can mean for a scene so used to employing it as a dirty word
if youre unfamiliar with berlin producer he makes a pseudo-psychedelic sort of house that sounds exactly like the splotchy art that adorns his leph releases over the past two years hes given us eleven tracks of bubbly weirdo house and his labels fourth release looks back on each with strong remixes from equally idiosyncratic contemporaries first up is mano for on speeding up the originals hypnotic slow-mo trance reverie into a true serotonin rush the arpeggios blur together at such high speeds offset some well-timed jazzy chords turning the originals meandering amble into a club-ready gallop chicago staple reas ted mix (confused yet ) of whats gain bundles up the choppy seasick tracks chords into bursts of joint-snapping tumbles a decisive piston-slam angle on his usually slightly more serene brand of dub techno but the highlight of the release belongs to relative unknown lithuanian producer wasted who turns into a swung breakbeat roller halfway between garage and tech house its a track that sounds eminently trendy and timely but imaginative enough to stand out anyway blowing so many future garage contemporaries right out of the water with something determinedly physical and assertive
if youre unaware of eric dulans superlative style behind the turntables the detroit dj makes mincemeat out of reduced tools turning banal loop techno into raw materials for something uniquely energetic and infectious its easy to view his productions as fodder for a three-deck extravaganza but that does a disservice to the joyful forward propulsion hes been honing for 20 years as dj one m o m continues in the same vein as dulans last dont e fraid 12-inch the first record under his - alias meaning its a pair of finely tuned bangers that are structured to reward long hauls title track centres on a distorted synth figure that steadily breaks up opens out and ping-pongs before whipping back into a high-tensile strut with the addition of 909 hi-hats classic blue-eyed strings enter the fray after the first drop and offer a plangent contrast to the crunchy surroundings (it feels like a moment of reflection given the tracks dedication to the recent passing of dulans mother ) chopped vocals in the final third recall earlier one favourites like reak it down and water slaves rounding out a certified barnstormer and rewarding djs patient enough to run deep into the track vocal cutting moves to the foreground on ratcheting beat-repeats make a female sample stutter through the rhythmic build though the technique wouldnt be out of place in an edm tune its placement among nervous squiggles and motor city dub chords makes for a reliable dance floor freak out
is back on with their latest ep esoteric systems shows the duo first pushing further into hard-techno excess then continuing to find plots of fertile ground through more experimental approaches that means this ones a mixed bag the a-side holds and two mid-130s bpm cuts with heavy bruising drums and freaked-out synths aplenty they could stir certain dance floors into a frenzy especially whose percussion is especially intimidating but at over seven minutes apiece they seem blown too far out of proportion when shorter more to-the-point versions would probably work better in the mix either way theres more interesting stuff on the b-side is an ultra-fast well-programmed hybrid that would fit with intense strands of drum bass it speeds along at close to 170 bpm with pumping percussion and harsh mechanical squelches bunched densely together but a couple sly rhythmic moves keep it from getting overwhelmingly blurry ditches most of their drums with the four-minute last track an anxious collage of rustling off-beat ticks and bleeping synths its a rare brief look into how the duo sound when they allow a little bit of extra space into their productions
a siren style vocal echoes softly in the beginning bars of before a deep kick and tight shaker compliment cow bells and background fx and slight guitar hits bounce in and out amongst the trippy vocal blurbs a heavy saw-style bass enters reeking havoc for two bars dropping out for the vox and slamming back in for peak time the bass drops out giving way to a series of clicks fxs and more vocal drops a third breakdown comes back with sick drum sequencing haunting vocals and tight percussive work a funked out mind trip for the minimal heads the true sound of after-hours (8/10) funky and bleepy how is this possible easy when it s several cow bells with a funky bass groove and housier approach are the order of the day on chick as a saxophone comes in adding more soul and depth female vocal clips help break up the sequencing and transition into a second bass line before leading back into the sax another vocal hit drops a synth melody with a disco loop which rides back into the saxophone taking over in what seems to be a well automated pattern a separate vocal loop is introduced at the main peak of the track with ahhs clicks dadas and didadis all over the place automation again takes hold and the saxophone is brought back in riding softly with the vocal loop a lil more housey than s prior stuff but still very peak set time look for derrick carter and the like to play this one (7/10) deep tech is my favourite genre to listen to and slipping away is a f*cking awesome example of this think space odyssey mixed with a corona commercial beginning with a very translucent mix of soft pads rhythmic clicks snares and abstract drum patterns a vibrant yet mellow guitar soon enters reminding me of japan for some reason a violin slides in somewhere between funk and new orleans for a brief moment before we are taken back to the guitar with a pad bass line unique fxs loose sticks and solid strings help mesh this into a dance floor variety track great for an intro or outro of that magical set (8/10)

a move from berlin to la a new engagement pastel imagery healing music if you hadnt been aware these things before listening to the album would still seem like a positive turn from travis stewart sped up and decked out in neon is unfailingly happy s the work an artist already known for fast music trying to go even faster he doesnt do it through higher bpms or jungle flights fancy stewart reduces his songs down to their essence and packs action and drums lots drums into every inch space he has turning the songs into dense blasts energy the giddy pacing captures the feeling falling in love not just with someone else but with a city with your own life s almost manic and moments calm are rare stewart borrows from edm rapid-fire drum rolls trap hi-hats to boost the impact though he rarely gives into the big drop he tends to either zoom f into a different idea or drop into a fray careening drums and basslines is split between brief instrumental tracks and meatier vocal collaborations when he works with ( ) and dawn richard ( ) he sews their voices into the quiltwork wielding breaths and syllables like percussive jabs on the others he flexes his pop muscle: is bog-standard radio r b with a pc music makeover while the much better features gorgeous vocals from stewart makes the latter feel head-spinning surrounding with high-pitched warbles and tumbling basslines without crowding his honeyed melodies the records pace is so breathless that the instrumentals ten feel like extended intros or outros when he doesnt have a vocalist to focus on stewart can sound lost on a disembodied voice chants the names colours (an unnecessary addition to an otherwise fine track) while the sugar high is harshed by pitched-down vocals and skronky basslines of gets it across better with a patient speech laying out some the new age ideology behind stewarts healing music at 3 minutes long is so dizzy and quick that its hard to find your bearings makes for a fun if exhausting ride one stewarts core talents the thing that made albums like room(s) so wonderful is keeping his keen sense emotion and melancholy in otherwise hard-hitting dance music theres almost none that contrast here just delirious happiness from beginning to end s hard to complain when listening to stewarts illustrious sound design and arrangements but in his quest for positivity limits itself to just a fraction the emotional spectrum
mainly a progressive house label fourth release sees them going into the breaks side of the music spectrum probably due to the quality of future funk squads remix of big heads dark side of the peace side a original mix this sounds quite similar to the plump djs remix of orbitals funny break (one is enough) especially with the rim taps on the top being hit on the upbeat this is a post climactic tune - uptempo chargey but leaning slightly toward the techy atmospheric side of breaks made possibly by the sweeping sunth stabs throughout side b big heads gargamel remix big heads remix on the flip goes back to the dark progressive that sinister have been known for in the first three releases thudding bass drums and big head have kept the synth stabs that made the original just like in the cartoon big heads gargamel remix has turned the smurfs into gold
londons has long been a go to for deep atmospheric house and techno and this compilation ep is another fine showcase these qualities everything on the release is strong but of by stands out its deadpan sci fi synths and fluttering percussion create something that could have featured on the last com truise ep elsewhere label head contributes the equally ethereal it has a more rumbling quality but features the same type quasi ambient keys the other two cuts ditch the flotation tank feel their counterparts but both still pack plenty atmosphere s dubby feels urgent pinging spring loaded keys against a rapid bassline detroits closes with a searing acid techno workout thatll do no harm at all to his reputation for nailing this style

across four vinyl releases manchesters meandyou label has made a beeline for a very specific corner of the dance floor s that spot where a run of the mill club transforms into a moody netherworld dark and enigmatic but strangely comforting named for a venue where meandyou have thrown parties the bookbinders follows on neatly from the labels previous compilation eps s a mixture of soupy house tracks and beatless numbers each giving little away but possessing a strange magnetism workshops opens the record cementing a relationship dating back to meandyou01 the careful percussion and single glimmering chord of amount to little at first but after eight minutes they build to a real potency a newcomer to the label provides the eps other house track though calling house stretches its definition s beat might have been assembled from vinyl crackle and a drum machine thats seen better days; it slouches along slow and heavy while thin chords scud uncertainly behind it sounds like dance music on the verge of collapsing into dust two beatless tracks are supplied by familiar meandyou faces s is four minutes of claggy drone simple but satisfying sculpts thick dub chords into an uneven sludge on ; squint and theres a downtempo groove in there s meandering at first but theres a payoff in the form of a wave of glittering arps as ever with meandyou patience is rewarded

its romania all the way on second release with funk-encrusted house being joined by a remix from minimal house compatriot petre lead track is the liveliest one on offer here quickly settling into its jacking 4/4 rhythm with ice-crisp drum snaps guttural bass synths and cosmic wooshes is an altogether more phlegmatic affair submerging itself into a pool of breathy vocal exhalations scratchy hi-hats and sonar-like shimmering pads ut if the original isnt deep enough then strips out the beats daubing with ambient analogue oscillations and what sounds like the inner workings of a cuckoo clock and a pub sign creaking in the wind strung out over 14 minutes its best listened to with all the lights on ack with liss own productions the digital-only atonement all chiming delayed synth phrases and soft shuffling percussion brings to a close a quaint atmospheric package
at first glance and minus might seem like odd pairing but when you consider the italian duos often dark dance floor-led approach youll begin to see where the two overlap kicks things off on uncomplicated terms aligning a classic pulsating techno groove with signature piercing synths on the pair come alive setting swelling pads over zesty rhythms as tinny synths cavort over the bouncy framework youll marvel at how they managed to make a brooding techno cut feel so funky they carry that same percussive strut over to strapping kicks and rigid claps to an instantly infectious synth line so perfectly do they capture a dark groovy core that in this instance their trademark emotive meanderings feel a touch superfluous

new yorks label released a whole lot of music in its first year of existence and i dont make my count purely by number of 12-inches: from jacques greenes smoothly digital house to twisted chicago oddities from the twilite tone to the private island bass-scapes of fatima al qadiris genre-specific xperience the label appeared less interested in connecting the dots of recent underground dance trends than scooping them all up in the same basket but as surprising as each release has been hasnt yet put forth something truly and incoherently wild a missive suggesting their a r department had found a laptop collective at the bottom of the ocean or a nascent footwork scene on mars in steps a drummer of storied ferocity (he joined hype williams on stage during their recent set at unsound new york played an epic drum solo and then disappeared into the fog) bearing four strange techno tracks shit as they say gets real s influences certainly lurk beneath these brackish carcinogen-rich waters you can just make out villalobos and dettmann in the pile next to the woodchipper but hes sure chosen a funny way of deploying them on his vinyl debut (zzz) starts out like tech house but s sequencer soon catches a bug: his knobs dial into the red zone no matter which way he turns them sending synth lines into wheezing fits as they struggle to comply with its throbbing ostgut ton core is a series of implosions and pushbacks a chain reaction left for dead a quickfooted bleepy jack track sounds like something shed might keep locked up in his basement and never speak of for his final act summons the epic and unfathomable love child of throbbing gristle and alcachofa its raw and bleak and admittedly pretty extreme but the cuneiform it carves into your eardrums imparts wisdom that reads weirdly like a way forward
even if he just had his residency at belfasts shine on his resume would have a legendary status in the techno scene hes held in awe by his countrymen (just ask the bicep boys) not just for his djing and productions but for what shine has done to unite northern irelands youth but this ep proves that when it comes to making music kieran still has chops the two productions on show his versatility is a twisted warehouse jam that confidently sits alongside anything technos latest mavens are making on saturday kieran cooks up nine minutes of devastatingly effective hard disco some crunching handclaps blaring car horns and juddering percussion on top of a quaking bassline catz n remix brings out the hidden menace in the original those horns ever more intense the beats increasingly frenetic while managing to retain the originals flavour twr72s remix of sees the dutch duo turn it into a thumping military march with clinking syncopation and a pong-style chiptune loop dimitri s version of takes it somewhere else altogether the russian producer throwing a slow-burning breakbeat under it and daubing it with drops of acid

a rare seamless integration of deep house dub techno and minimal s jazz space ep was one of the highlights of 2007 his newest on mobilees schizophrenic sub-label leena continues the trend even though the results here are somehow less cohesive in s case the sub-genres somehow seem to fraction out within each track with the minimal tropes largely dispensed with altogether is the best of the bunch and perhaps the only one of the three tracks that hints at minimals taut sound palette within the texture of its air-tight melody line the metallic dub phasing that sweeps through creates too much liquid funk however to keep it tied down for long the bouncy beat and echoing diva vocals that dominate should tip you off though: this is deep house is solid but also the least interesting of the set the mix here is almost 50-50 deep house and dub techno close to some of main streets output the beat is all house while the dub stylings lash out over the top seemingly in a disconnected void of their own but while its highly danceable and listenable it lacks an inscrutable element such as the voice in to stir up the balance between the layers on the other hand is pure dub techno and could easily be an outtake from the same sessions that produced elixir the kick drum and bass are buried but fragile like some of quantecs recent output the beauty here though is that the repetition and simplicity of the opening passages do not reflect the somewhat sinister undercurrents and bubbling spaces that slowly emerge from beneath the mirrored surface
erich bogatzys nascent label launched with some fanfare with italian house duo lula circus in january for their second release they look closer to home with stalwart german dj carsten rauch turning in a trio of house tracks that range from trad to quirky lead track is a jaunty affair built on the back of repetitive filtered synth phrases a stonking piano loop and the merest smidge of a vocal creasingly prolific brit producer chase toughens the original up with sneakish sub-bass although stays true to the originals spirit up to this point so far so standard then rausch tries something a little different you dont often hear a house producer dialing back to the 20s for inspiration (the last time i can remember is greenskeepers low and sweet a madcap swing house track released on classic in 2003 ) isnt quite as wildly offbeat as low and sweet but its parping brass and ukuleles will still stop you in your tracks in a club context isnt that what were all looking for of closes proceedings out and could have been submerged by the previous track stead it adroitly locks into a deep house gallop with glittering synths and scrunched up percussion for company

londons has been zig-zagging around tech house and bass music staking a middle ground between the chunky (his remix of bwana) and waify (his floaty ambient garage ep on apollo) marks his debut on the somewhat schizo under 5s and the label gets two tracks that find dixon at his most hybridized the creaky breakbeat of struts through a poor-visibility blizzard of arctic string samples with just the hint of a skip its enough to remind of the producers london heritage not to mention its wonderfully jumpy bassline that plays the double-time trickster to the tracky drum pattern it adds necessary heft to a song that otherwise feels like it might drift away on a sea of bass music clich s taking things away from house to territory that more resembles drum bass im is a fidgety number that clicks and clacks through another thick fog of atmospherics with warbly disembodied voices at every turn its the same precarious mixture of deluxe synths hackneyed r b vocal samples and a killer ear for rhythm section intricacy that thankfully never loses its footing on the tightrope of good taste dauwds remix however steals the show the pictures music artist loosens the limbs of into an easy jaunt leaving room for a bouncy bassline that pops in halfway through to redress the track with an infectious melody thatll be stuck in your head for days funnily enough dauwd strikes an even poppier chord than dixons lullabies with a track thats arguably much more concerned with the dance floor
perhaps answering criticism that he got lazy after reflections martin seems to be back on track with his collaboration with ben watt earlier this year and this sublime release or more accurately hes de-mired himself by progressing its still (as always) unmistakably : each track is a textured oil painting with a groove thats almost unbelievably tight considering its constructed from dry twigs reflections though was largely thin and light in its flitting transient ideas whereas the tracks in feel like compositions rather than mosaics; more symphonic thats not always because of the emotional depth injected by fuller chords in the title track this and his brittle rhythms take a back seat to lazarusmans soliloquy some may see it as preachy others deep and meaningful; but with advice such as put yourself in positions where change is favourable not just circumstantial ill plump for the latter meanwhile has a characteristic melodic line hovering in the background but the scratchy violins that previously might have been short punctuations build and lift the track still with understatement and restraint until a sweet melancholy is reached with pianos near the end my personal favourite is likewise thick and heavy but more religious than plainly sad with an undercurrent of spine-tingling tickles and spanish guitars joined by hymnal chords its weird but gorgeous late night outdoor festival djs take note is less focused but i can forgive him on three counts firstly its a b-side that falls perfectly reasonably into the something different from the others category; secondly its only slipping not slipped and this median point has a dreamlike quality about it; and thirdly in terms of simple beauty its among the most tender tracks hes ever done and when the pads swell around the four or five minute mark it simply makes my heart ache
run by berlin-based italian alessandro pasini has been diligently releasing easy-on-the-ears deep house since 011 the majority of its records have come from pasinis deep88 alias though last year he teamed with maltese producer melchior sultana on and for the labels tenth outing pasini has put together a remix package based on these tracks that features australias andras and elusive new rk producer ben cenac aka dream with only two eps since 1990 fans of cenac will appreciate just how rare an appearance this is his take on carries all the familiar tropes ethereal pads rhythmic bells and a balmy gently urgent bassline while staying true to the original boosting its deep space appeal does an even neater job on stripping away the originals flabby framework he lays imperfect kicks and a warm funky bassline beneath xylophone flourishes and pasini and sultanas scintillating piano the ep ends with a new cut from the duo 100 which rounds out the release in a sun-lit fog of faux panpipes and cascading chords it stands up against the remixes without threatening their superiority
records part of the final frontier family of labels has had a special relationship with detroit in particular underground resistance since the mid nineties ur and its many offshoots dont work for just anybody so its always a matter of great interest when their work turns up on imprints other than their own here raiders of the lost rp aka mario pierro is the recipient of the detroit remix treatment and the results are predictably good original mix of the is a rather leaden affair compared to the two remixes but it does contain some classic detroit motifs that will make it useful as a set opener closer or interlude remix being of course none other than mad mike banks doesn t disappoint and embodies for me at least most of what makes detroit techno such a special immutable genre taking the central riff of the original and amplifying it to new levels of intensity the track easily achieves a level of spirituality that other artists can only hope for some of the early ur tracks were very garage influenced and i can hear it here as well as strains of that perennial classic hi-tech jazz djs a relative newcomer to the ur collective is credited with the other remix along with los the one-time refuge of dj rolando and still home to one of technos quiet genuises gerald mitchell gain this mix takes the original s main element and allows it to develop making use of some nicely dissonant keys but its not quite as lush as the g g version i just about prefer this version to mad mikes this is a very strong release but if i have one criticism there really isnt that much variety going on ur are much more than a one trick pony so it would have been nice if had included something a bit different nyone care to make an electro version
taapion a vinyl only techno label from paris launched last year with a gritty first release from shl mo who runs the label with and for their second record the label heads link up with a couple more locals delivering a nicely diverse four tracker that further highlights taapion and its artists as a worthy addition to the french techno scene from is as the name might imply a restrained spacious effort it packs an interesting drum arrangement (djs will need to give some attention to those stuttered kicks) and an elastic lead while long orchestral sighs and urgent bleeps drift sharply into focus picks up the pace a little on moving through echo laden corridors occasionally illuminated by a descending synth line s leads the b side and his menacing 3/4 drive is the records most peak time ready cut best track here might be the last shl mo and s twelve which enters into airier environs and features all sorts of soft glimmering synths overall though theres no filler on this collection of straightforward and subtle cuts
new 12-inch from is a bumpy ride that isnt to say its a bad ride far from it but now that we think we know our dub-techno-house hero he goes ahead and shows us that he has plenty more gears from which to choose is vintage vincent with deep bass melodies crafted from pulses and that uniquely melodic percussion of his that sounds like it could be recreated by cast of stomp if y were really into reverb and dub techno b-side softens things up a bit though with a relatively house-y beat that recalls moment of relief on vincents recent r podcast that was housemaster baldwins dont lead me producer lends his distinctive touch in creeping dub chords and plaintive melody that pours out ts vincent at his most emotional or so thought be e got to closer which is a stunning spare track that sounds like nothing else in his recent oeuvre this man who once titled a song woman devil one singing over and over with a slight bit of autotune and/or vocoder added to his vocals t may divide fans of his work squarely down middle but as a warm-up or a cool-down from a set of bruising techno it might just be most self-consciously beautiful track youll hear all night
this is the re-release of a huge house classic which originally appeared on deep dish s penetrate deeper compilation back in 1995 back then the cd caused a ripple in the house scene giving it new meaning and strength which has survived the test of time as well as getting re-released in 2003 featured heavily on this compilation with mixes from both the deep dish boys appearing dubfire s dream of paradise is an example of pure house music wonderfully full and energetic piano/xylophone hooks and melodies is what this mix is all about no mucking around here repetition is not a word to use as the melodies roll on and on with smooth bass and no actual baselines involved which is amazing as the appeal stays classic house getting deeper sharam s deep dish dreamscape ventures into subdued bass drums and rasping percussion with a stripped back melody an early breakdown gives way to the melody and an effected vocal sample with the mix taking it along for the rest of the ride a quirky mellow bassline works well alongside sharam s interpretation of the melody as it really shows in the main breakdown once again melody remains supreme the skylark remix pushes the tempo and bass with an impressive peak time houser using bits of the melody as the bassline and tight rolling percussion skylark pushes the sound into new areas the melody still remains the draw card here and is so infectious in the breakdown addition of many other melodies add to the overload of sounds while the timed fading of the bass to the introduction of yet another melodic hook is very nice this subtle change gives off that little bit more charge as the mix leads back into the bass and to the finish classic is all i can say about this re-release many people will be taken back to the 90 s immediately upon hearing these mixes it still stands the test of time

s s gunver ryberg made her contort debut in 2014 performing amidst the noisy melee of berlins may day later that august she returned for contorts atonal showcase and was back again in february for the launch at tresor now the label has coaxed the first solo record out of the danish musician and sound artist theres one other release in rybergs catalogue moved by magnets a cassette of collaborations with cristian vogel as sgr^cav that tape serves as a neat entry into the academically grounded spatially-based work ryberg has been known for since graduating from the academy of music and dramatic arts is a snapshot of rybergs intense live shows which she says take the transformative physical power of sound as their muse if youve caught her before youll know persistent staccato rhythms and sweeping dramatic atmospheres are her paint which she applies in dense and mesmerising layers thats all on this ep alongside raw and unbridled sounds that grate and grind with contorts industrial sheen the bare bones mix of takes things to another level its driving and insistent from the start and it swells with terror as if about to burst but the rising panic never breaks and we careen through unscathed rybergs original version is far more ethereal even with that vigorous drum pattern surging through it which goes some way to illustrate the sublime paradoxes at play here with a series of lithe compositions that pack one hell of a punch shows theres poise and grace to be found in the meanest darkest recesses of noise its delicate and fierce beautiful and brutal and completely stunning all over
for juan macleans return to the 12-inch arena after some serious djing and live work he opened with march single happy house a nancy whang-sung track that lived up to its carefree title nd while doesnt quite belie its name it is a bit sneaky you think youve got the plot as the first four minutes develop a simmer of several entrancing synth lines a solid unassuming beat an extremely nuggety break and the usual hefty dollop of futurism ut then abruptly in comes the vocal another one by whang and its crisp and its clean and its suddenly ok to smile about the 80s again n the juan himself shows up and he and the whang are trading verses juans great man-boy-child vocal recalls obby os similarly unaffected outings completely lacking in pretension perfectly delighted just to be here and wrangle a few extra oooo s out of the word do more significantly juans nimble humility serves as the perfect foil for whangs own sparkling innocuous gaiety unlike her background-dwelling work with lcd soundsystem her input here seems loads more crucial enriching the dynamic with the kind of charming brittle humanity that always seemed to peek around the edges of the juan macleans prior work marcus turns up for remix duties on the -side and wisely avoids toying with the strong duet form of the original focusing instead on the shimmering feel of the intro and inserting a few fx-laden vocal drops to remind us just which jam this is much more laidback and rooted to the pulsing present moment than the -side its nice enough but ultimately cant compete with the originals whomping italo-punch and coy vocals clearly the time spent catering to the dancers for juan seems to have paid off: res a bright sharp new luster to that worn old mask
if a piece of music is a vessel for ideas then bjarkis tend to overflow since the launch of his label he seems to be getting ever more blas about splashing the carpet something weirdcore his debut as was a riff on classic uk hardcore its follow up drowns that approach in a torrent of bizarre sonics and capricious left-turns the zaniness of bjarki s music can be derivative of a particular artist its not just this eps incomprehensible track titles that recall aphex twin and the pedestrian b u s y evoke him in their imagining of a synth-funk played by sentient machines elsewhere though bjarki gets bored of aping the master as he does of everything (usually after about 30 seconds) gooey rave chords hover uneasily next to the plastikman drum charge of as if these musical elements are uncomfortable associating with one another and will be leaving at the earliest opportunity the rest of the ep sheds even basic decorum on and fidgety beats repeatedly form and then tail off as if unconvinced of the worth of carrying on you might at first try to follow the musical narrative but after a while the bits between the beats whooshes of fizz and digital crackle radiophonic bleepscapes clouds of insectoid chitter and squeal start to tell a story of their own its as if hyper-intelligent aliens are trying to communicate by means of an fm synth maybe someone should tell them thats not what its for
salons des amateurs is a small club nestled in d sseldorfs contemporary art museum it has a reputation for being the kind of place where musically speaking you go weird or go home the salon has become a breeding ground for a new wave of d sseldorfs art and music kids a friend of mine recently described it as the weirdo post-kraut scenes ha ienda and currently nurtures labels like stabil elite kuntskopf and which throws occasional parties at salons des amateurs has been going for about five years now and its latest record comes from wolf m ller is m llers second release for tfgc following his hard-to-find 2011 debut lagerfeuer tanz theres a rainforest image on the front sleeve; on the back each track is broken down with exotic sounding instrument credits looking at the information which is in german it struck me how most european labels dumb down things like this for english speakers; personally i find it way more fun to wonder what a mehrspurmischung is or whether id know a maultrommel if i saw one opening track a springy and loose live jam waddles along to the sound of gongs bells and bass though its slightly heavier continues in the same vein the two pieces forming one 13-minute suite the kontan mix of which appeared in its original form on lagerfeuer tanz is moved along by a pretty hook while the records title track opens the b-side with what can only be described as a lesson in german bongo funk the first time i heard jtcs remix of its machine-fuelled rhythms sounded out of place almost garish in contrast to the preceding cuts but the acid squelches grow on you and its undeniably weird so maybe its not that out of place after all
mica levi has an eclectic resume shes made stripped-back circuit-bent pop with her trio and the shapes composed classical works for string ensembles and scored jonathan glazers unnerving sci-fi film under the skin that interdisciplinary experience means shes full of fresh ideas which is certainly true of levis seven-track ep for demdike s label with this dance floor-oriented music its apparent that she thinks beyond standard routines of programming drums synths and sequencers her holistic approach pulls from outside genre confines and it makes for a refreshing ep featuring singer and frequent collaborator is the standout the charm of this tilted 2-stepper is levis controlled chaos: her bruised drums lag skip and smash like theyre about to fall apart the melody darts frantically up and down the scale while the low-register synths shake and sweat like theyre overheating similarly is a lovely mess held together by savvy intricate programming with such short run times (just under three and two minutes) the only downside is those tracks arent longer thankfully demdike s edit extends s twisted garage groove by three minutes and they make the wise decision not to add or subtract much from the original then things get progressively weirder 7 is built around an abused guitar riff that loops ominously over dissonant piano and a chintzy rock beat trip6love is unhinged: a single measure spins until you start to feel seasick while s voice unfurls into freeform noodling these two and which has patois-inflected verses from lend personality to but dont fit the initial tone and are great because theyre feral and functional at the same time two untamed party tracks for the freaks but these other three feel like filler not sharp enough for the dance floor not deep enough to dive into
lcd soundsystem and juan maclean collaborator nancy whang and pbr streetgang member bonar bradberry are something of a modern disco dream team for their first collaboration the pair cover donna summers of the three versions included here the disco version shines brightest it sees whang and bradberry take the track into bobby orlando-ish territory with whangs beautiful goosebump-inducing take on the vocal floating over a big rolling bassline and sparkling disco synths radio edit has a more contemporary feel with its spacey bed of warm beats faraway pads and bass bleeps that occasionally give way to whangs voice extended version stretches these ingredients into a languid epic treat
since he emerged in 2014 s style of techno tough and tactile has differed from the grungy lo-fi with which l i e s is associated though the malaysian-chinese producers music is loud and authoritative he eschews the noise that defines some of his labelmates music on his first album named after a character dongfang bubai in a jin yong novel industrial and ebm is the name of the game corporating ideas from a vast array of artists across those genres s debut album feels both hulking and nimble nine ch nails comes to mind on the incredible opener whose vibrating steel strings and drum onslaught call back to 1999s fragile s tottering percussion and otherworldly instrumentation would be a breath of fresh air in any techno set sprightly rhythms are offset by unsteady melodies some sound like woodwinds others like synth patches that bend and decay a combination that underlines the records engaging mix of futurism and exoticism while the album is heavy on melody s real hooks are in its percussion metallic drums on sound like chain links rattling in the wind is like a downwards record beefed up by a marching band powerful hand drums that could have come from a chinese orchestra are the focal point on records other major highlight is mans a lurching number that highlights the topsy-turvy dimension of s music eerie vocals resemble industrial while the detuned bassline points and resonant screeches in the backdrop point to some old horror film a recent interview with rbma recounted the story of dongfang bubai who hunts after the secrets of being a swordsman contained in a scroll which instructs the practitioner to castrate himself to learn the art giving up power and masculinity to gain other powers appealed to who seems to have taken it to heart for his debut album: this is techno that is pummelling and fierce but never burly or macho its as agile as the aspiring swordsman who inspired it
this is s fourth release following on the heels of an amazing twelve months worth of 12 s on playhouse including the deranged glitch-funk of klatta and the monkeys-with-typewriters rhythmic randomness of serpentine more recently with swiss on rye they ve shown an equally impressive facility with dreamy melody and jazzy improvisation this release moves even further away from frenetic dancefloors and towards lazy beach parties (a bit of a trend this year that is) as a huge fan of s earlier work i was a little disappointed in the title track klatta and serpentine both felt utterly mold-breaking and different to any of the current wave of dance music butterflies and zebras on the other hand feels identifiably part of a genre i m not too sure what genre that is something that takes in wolfgang voigt s gas project (in its dancier moments) and oliver lieb s java from the early nineties the track has a slow deep rolling bassline and wandering pads over a strong 4/4 rhythm but it doesn t really go anywhere and leaves little trace of its passing when its done getting there it s a pleasant enough exercise in chill-out house but i d prefer them to go back to the spastic rhythms they re so good at on their upcoming album there is also john dahlback doing his thing on a remix if you enjoy the john dahlback thing you ll probably like this but i suspect i m not alone in thinking that he could do with releasing a little less and spending a little more time crafting quality tracks that actually sound different from one another fantastic biting snare sound though people will dance to it the stand-out track here is moneybowl tropical coos and twitters adorn an itchy funky base of stuttered snares and syncopated toms halfway in they throw in a glorious sixteen bars of sharp and pointed prime-time synths that force their way into your brain like a pair of knitting needles simple and effective overall this is one of the more varied 12 s you re likely to hear this year both in terms of style and quality
based in sao paulo babe terror debuted in 2009 with weekend and since then has continued to conduct home-brewed experiments in what he calls wrong dance music using vocals presets and fx pedals to create decompositions reverting his sound sources by processing and modification into a raw silk state his latest mini-album is the seamy side of contemporary dance fabric exposed magine the field subject to five further phases of distortion and youll have some idea of what awaits you here opener 1 sets the tone of lo-fi extremism and psychedelic obfuscation its drum machine pumping away like a pair of 19th century bellows as cut-up vocals drown in a slurry of echo and granulated detritus the more ominous opens with click-clacking and then the sinister hoving of phantasmagorical drones emerging vengefully as if from some sunken landfill of long discarded pop and rock history is a brief holy invocation dominated by a flute motif and a ritual ectoplasmic swirl ascends and evolves from the point at which the opening track left off beset by giant worms of electric guitar but also lovely shapeshifts reminders of what a pleasurable as well as challenging experience represents finally theres a relative feeling of clarity and aftermath on despite its title or perhaps its simply a case of becoming accustomed to the half-light and adjusted focus of babe terrors sound world
is the factory finished for a few years in the early 00s it seemed as though the merry band of gentlemen and their secret weapon would plough a cartoonish hole through the heart of dance music introducing grit to the prevailing kompakt melodicism things have changed: melody left the building with minus house came back and started some sublabels and opened up the main imprint to people not named metope konfekt or on a more regular basis judging by the results of rabimmel with a vengeance this can only be a good thing is paired up with for which sees the duo working handsomely together is a relative unknown and s website is typically unhelpful in discerning any information but it seems as though he/she/they are pushing towards the dance floor with offering up her trademark niggling melodies and vocal stabs in response is the only old guard producer on solo offer here but he earns his keep coming up with a stumbling and bumbling beat that seems ready to devolve into chaos before a fat synth comes in to offer up cohesion (the deadening bass stomp doesnt hurt either ) the same thing happens on s flipside epic this time the beat is a solid one but those synths slot easily between what seems like ten different moving parts like i want to sleep from earlier this year its a track thatll have you going bug eyed on the dance floor wondering from what diseased and brilliant mind it emerged from thus is the power of in
as the fourth artist allowed a whole ep to air his wares on adds plenty of house music dirt and analogue edginess to the labels impressive arsenal sounding something like legowelt but with an icy abstraction in place of the dutchmans warming tape hiss cuts like are simultaneously louche and paddy but amped and fizzing unpredictable in everything from the way the beats bump the basslines bobble and the melodies get torn apart is distorted and dark as if designed to scare rather than invite you into moving your body buried within each track are elements which prevent things from being full-on nasty a radiant detroitian synth a familiar dusty clap or hints of bottom-end warmth all offset the m-cat edginess just enough to make things feel human is the finest example of that while brios me is the sound of a digital comedown la the early pixelated output of boxcutter stimulating your every synapse right until the end
a year seems like a long time to wait for s second release (their first with mr g came out in april of 2014) but then isis salvaterra and claus the pair behind the london label and party havent got to where theyre at by rushing things turns out his best most mature work in a four-tracker that itself arrives 12 months after his last outing fans of that yum record with its meandering club-ready aesthetic will be instantly drawn to minor but theres also a newer side to here and are the two dance floor cuts and theyre both the kind of bass-heavy tightly wound techno weve come to associate with the german the former is the more lively and robust driving a serpentine bassline through a dark alley of snappy synths and smoggy pads takes an eerier approach dangling an uneasy melody over furious hi-hats and a fleshy bassline the releases most interesting moments though are when leaves the four-to-the-floor pulse to one side on its as if hes teasing us constructing a moody atmosphere from bass hits low-toned vocal samples and moby-like flourishes thatll have you crying out for a kick drum that never comes smart djs could work wonders with this one and then theres a track most easily described as dubby downtempo with a hint of jazz that its the eps best track shows s ability to make music for alternative settings and his continued desire to explore the limits of his sound
russian producer alexey devvyanin has always felt like an artist without a scene to call his own sometimes his music sounds like it came straight out of london; other times from los angeles his tracks have appeared on the us label car crash set the uks civil music and s leisure system and devvyanin also runs his own label hyperboloid which exists primarily online releasing records from artists like ultrademon his debut lp is based on his memories of cities he visited in the past couple of years areas with distinct sounds and characteristics which seems an especially apt idea for such a chameleonic producer as fires up you realize these songs are not imitations of specific places though the metallic clink of techno is somewhere in the tracks quick-footed thrust youll have to use your imagination to fill in the rest of the picture other correlations on are more logical: devyanin serves up footwork for touches on relaxed hip-hop for the thai resort town and conjures up images of velvet-rope vip nightclubs with the glossy deep house of but if you have any idea what hes getting at when it comes to then youve got one better on me on and bod he settles on vibrant garage in the vein of brackles seemingly ignoring the concept altogether in a way works the same way memory does just as you only remember certain parts of trips and vacations devyanins musical interpretations of these cities are filtered through his own experiences beyond that youve got the usual hallmarks: an iridescent synth twinkle here a fat midrange bassline there some pitched-down r b samples at times it sounds a little complacent or even dated (no one really needs to sample destinys childs say my name in ) the result isnt always as exciting as the concept makes it out to be but is still a fun record by an excellent producer
reviewing s clutch ep back in 2012 i said im not quite sure what one is supposed to call this music he hasnt made it any easier since weve had minimalist rhythmic workouts synth-soaked reveries and most recently beatless excursions each one more reduced than the last but what made them great was david kennedys unusual ear for melody thats remained a constant from the bright organ streaks of untitled to the repetitive uppercuts of power drums his debut album takes the ongoing distillation of his music to another level largely abandoning melody in favour of dry percussive rattling hes left us with a head-scratcher of a first album that feels confused and at times uninspired there are glimpses of the maverick producer at his best here after a suitable warm-up with kennedy delivers one of his best club tunes in years with a track built on a rubbery bounce with eerie strings and aquatic melodies that squeak and pop as if theyre being pushed up against the edges of the track the closer is equally powerful albeit in a more direct way this one is broken and distorted like an old track thats been clobbered with a hatchet its forthrightness is all the more satisfying after sitting through a record that feels like its constantly holding back on kennedy plays out a simple synth tone over and over while static slowly eats away at the edges theres no percussion or momentum nor any particular direction that issue is exacerbated by the following track a barebones drum loop with a droopy synth that sounds like a smoke alarm with dying batteries these tracks and a few others on make for a knotty midsection that drags in spite of the albums short run time on any one listen you might latch onto something appealing like the hand-cranked drums on the very weird but the album has an unfortunate tendency to melt into a beige blob that can make even the more full-bodied and otherwise nice little morsels feel bloodless by proximity as his first-full length is kennedys most substantial release yet but its also one of his least adventurous its possible that he viewed the lp as a respite from from the trappings of a dance 12-inch a yearning that raindrops seemed to reflect but the records hesitance to go too far in any one direction lands it in an awkward place between clubby and experimental there are good moments on and the oddball compositional style kennedy has been perfecting since the beginning means that even the less exciting tracks here have their upsides but coming from a producer who habitually finds new ways to dazzle is uncharacteristically average
harry aigus first original material of is also the inaugural release for regraded an offshoot of his own graded label new endeavor has been set up to concentrate on sample-based disco-tinged house and the record wastes no time delivering this after its airy percussive intro adds andr s-like strings and simple key flashes to the mix making for a tune as uncluttered as it is luxuriant dont takes the disco feel further with a breathy vocal sample even before the intoxicating bass kicks in mid-track the mix of vocals bongos and sun-dappled pads is a delight that bassline however lifts the track higher priming it to standout in any dj set regraded is sure to be a label to watch
following a star vocal turn on mumdances take time shows off production chops almost as polished as his mc skills on this instrumental ep is four tracks long but trades in a surprising range of atmospheres best of all is the title track which can be mapped on the same continuum as slackks recent sinogrime offshoots peppers the core swirling melody with a clatter of gunshots each one as sharply defined as his bars the clash between silky synth and smashing percussion building the tension until it gets too much to bear and the track is cut off is more conventional an elastic 8-bar rhythm with a hint of underlying menace although is anything but it has a colourful splash of rubbery synths that give it the energy of a sugar-fuelled kid let loose in an arcade is another high-octane tune whose hyperactive melody whizzes all over the place with cracking snares giving the whole thing weight without detracting from its manic momentum itd be easy to lump in with instrumental grimes current upstarts but if anything im reminded of another artist whose knack for making grime beats is matched by his talent as an mc true these may be early days to be making wiley comparisons but suggests might be headed in that direction
the promo video made for sunset of a clown volume ii is the opening shot to a godard film soundtracked by s its either the height of pretension or pretty brilliant that i cant work out which probably makes it the latter music that actually puts you in a position where youre required to think about how it makes you feel is often among the finest and the tracks that surround it on this second release from s imprint arent necessarily the greatest things in the world but each of them occupy a space that is hard to quantify and thats exactly the point s is bustling with microsound while a piano plays quickly over top in a superior mood piece while s biting of french folkie is a nice twist on the prevailing trend towards south american protest songs (he overlays it with a lazy breakbeat rather than a pounding house beat too which seems to fulfill his stated goal of taking the beats even slower ) meanwhile brings the only track that veers close enough to a dance floor it builds and it builds as an acoustic guitar and kick drum while away as a hazy sample gradually comes into view typically the climax isnt the sort of thing that will have amnesia crowds in ecstasy but when youre dealing with music as intimate as this you tend to want to have it for yourself anyway

the low indigo boss and an early dubstep adopter in vancouver took a different path from his peers when he moved to bcs idyllic sunshine coast its no surprise then that this ep sounds like it was made in isolation this second release on calgarys modern math showcases his idiosyncratic brand of dance music birthed from a deep-seated love of dub and r b and written from faint memories instead of direct inspirations red uses patterns and ideas that are familiar the open spaces of dubstep the skitter of garage but he puts them together in unfamiliar ways has a definite swing yet its tight and neurotic like late 90s idm the array of nondescript noises and heavy-handed reverb has more to do with dub techno while the fragmented bassline and vocal samples sound like early hessle audio but taken as a whole sounds like none of these things is even more withdrawn with all the elements held so tightly together theyre reduced to slivers of sound especially the stuttering vocal cut-ups representing the spacier end of reds live sets is all massive reverb and sub-aquatic atmospheres pulled along by a persistent tom that tugs like a water current has the eps most straightforward beat and is also the sparest cut here the shards of colour almost make up a chord progression but theyre more of a hint than a revelation all of reds work is like that alluring and just a little bit mysterious and never allowing you too close a look
further highlights penchant for imbuing hard-edged techno with an ornate ideal of sound design is the choice cut a deranged lunge that feels like its tripping with every frenzied leap ut theres also a distinct sense of space at work here the kicks bellow sonorously and the chords feel like theyre trying to scratch at the edges of the track only getting more ferocious with each passing swipe the title track on the other hand throws down a gauntlet of pounding drums and frantic chords more in the realm of his uk techno ancestors even here however the subtleties underline the brute force: distorted bass splotches of melody and a bleep that sounds like its rusting mid-song all provide something for your mind to grasp while hes beating the shit out of you theres also another dimension of russell on show here: his mpia3 project where aggression is the sole deciding factor taking the (relatively speaking) pretty eacon from the previous ep the mpia3 rework is like a s hk record gone mad distorted kicks that would make lawan blush thrash violently for six minutes with only the slightest hints of melody breaking through the squall
hotflush may have made its name on dubstep but this excellent three-song ep from londons james is closer in nature and sound to other strains of dub s with his previous ep rawww builds his tracks on four-to-the-floor pulses quicker and more insistent than most house but not quite as steely as techno and with plenty of odd little rhythmic fillips that give them dubstep currency this eps best moments are reminiscent in feel (and to some degree in sound) with the early output of perlon restlessly tweaked minimalism done with imagination pays special attention to percussion on the clicking glugging hollow-toned semi-organic-in-spite-of-themselves rattles and crackling sounds all mutate steadily beneath the tracks central kick-hat pattern and the tracks melodic motif such as it is merges so closely with the rhythms that the result seems more like it was discovered than created which appeared on the sub:stance mix by hotflush head scuba earlier this year is a straight-up percussion workout: quicker barer and more straightforward with the beats seeming to splinter as they go the final track a has no beats at all its closer to something youd find on an old mille plateaux compilation laptop glitch thats slightly jarring after the avant-bounce before it nevertheless its congruent with the other tracks even as it departs from them
after making huge waves with their last release on fat rite of passage/get retro baobinga i d return with another installment of deep progressive breakbeat for those end of night moments the pair have shown they can be quite versatile with their production styles dropping smashing tear out on hardcore beats a garage influenced platter on vertical sound and now deeper emotive breakbeat on fat the machine features a long-winded introduction made up of a steady grooving breakbeat with deep male vocal stabs and a deep percussive lick thrown in for good measure slowly but surely a bassline and synth melody come into the picture increasing in volume but never seeming to go anywhere the vocals match the vibe of the tune perfectly: when the machine breaks down we break down it does have that dark depressing feel to it emo-step im personally not feeling this one i just dont see how it would work on a dancefloor however i have been informed by a trustworthy friend to try it on a good rig before making my final judgement jelly roll on the flip sees baobinga i d revisit some of their past techniques such as triplets and heavily syncopated drum fills but what really stands out is the electro bassline which builds up as the tune progresses into acid squelches for the duration of the track on top of the manic bassline baobinga i d lay down various vocal stabs and builds to create an interesting vibe i was somewhat disappointed with this as i was sort of hoping for something a bit more energetic and uplifting however its obvious that wasnt the vibe they were going for
s mr tophat rt lfie end their series of singles with theyre already three records into a new one krlvk these have been helmed by en sims dj jes and radio slave as the duo began to invite outside artists onto their label those records were faithful to the sound i particularly like dj jess bright disco loops on first generation but theyve not quite nailed whatever it is that makes rudolf nordstr m and oscar wedrens finely-tuned formula so effective hews close to what the producers do best but shows off a couple of neat new tricks the duos big drums and techy disco groove on the -side thunder along in a thinner atmosphere than usual their tracks can occasionally feel a bit too dense and so the extra space does wonders for s simmering soul and disco samples which suddenly explode with joy about five minutes in fter the midway peak faint horror movie screams spill out as the colour begins to drain some dance floors might not notice this shift in mood too much but its a shlocky little gift for those that do engan a bubbling house track that plateaus with thick hand percussion and muddy film dialogue leans too heavily on its large frame and an intermittent three-syllable vocal the undulating tones of its counterpart underscore how flat engan is in comparison
across different genres and tempos felix manuel has always had a knack for theatricality breathless spoken word spectral singers and ornate strings are all key ingredients of a sound that when done tastefully makes for gripping electronic music but apply them too liberally and they turn overbearing which happened on his debut album seven lies in 2013 now manuel reemerges on with two of his strongest cuts in years captures what made manuels earliest material so enticing with serpentine string samples and operatic vocals that shimmer like a mirage the track moves with a start-stop shudder that mirrors the scuttle of ena another samurai artist before it sidesteps into a tribal groove that slams just as hard but with a more supple swing is like an anxiety attack translated into music built on a glitchy bed of breaks the main melodic elements are clipped gasps and snippets of phrasing the kind youd hear in old dubstep tracks which sound terse and exciting putting the sometimes overwrought qualities of s music in a new light
eric estornel started year by finally dropping one of 2010s most popular tracks and looks to be rounding up in similar fashion comes as a simple one-sided piece of vinyl devoid of b-sides remixes or anything else that might distract you from main event tmospherically rich from outset as a result of lavishly layered pads and looped vocal interjections its main synth line develops slowly over course of track finally coming into prominence post-break; a muted beam of light from an isolated lighthouse momentarily piercing relative gloom before sinking back into obscurity s you might expect bassline is phenomenal striking perfect balance between finger-slapping funk and pulsing urgency its this fine line between accessibility and credibility that so many artists find impossible to reconcile; on evidence of this at least estornels poise is faultless
s follow-up to his r s debut dust is more in keeping with the unsettling techno of last years lp as wraetlic than that eps breaks-littered clatter after spending the last couple of years focused on electronic musics more experimental spheres smoke recently said its nice to get my mind back to dance floor the music is far from straightforward 4/4 fodder but here those investigations are bolted to a more functional chassis on the kicks thud between scampering toms then suddenly squirm into less expected shapes creasing against the scratchy synth line its as hallucinogenic as the title suggests s swung thud is so heavy it crackles as it pounds away beneath arps whose swirl seems dreamy at first then nightmarish but despite the drums clout theyre secondary to smokes sound design synths layer like gathering storm clouds a riff like s which sounds not unlike something mr ayhun might fashion is at first effervescent but collapses into oppression its a similar tack with green man where a straightforward techno chugger racks up disembodied voices over steam-engine drums twisting at the midpoint into a m lange of almost folky arpeggios it all makes for constant shifts in mood of tension built then released like crashing waves
s safe to say that was responsible for some pretty good releases in the first half of the 00s allied with vocalist tim fuller show me right and you dont know more than made their mark so its good to see him back and on form aided by some very useful remixes even if has a similar riff to alis momentous acid track in the day it still does more than enough to carve out its own niche lady precise who featured on you i by ali a few years back returns and her vocals effortlessly embellish the groove bodycode highlights the vocal in a more synthetic way and his chugging analogue interpretation goes off on another tangent altogether is a dubby tribal piece which due to its phased saxophone and tough beats calls to mind a sped-up show em whatcha got -era public enemy the dub is further emphasised in subb-an s alternate take which doesnt depart too far from the original but chooses to emphasise a metronomic percussive timbre seelie meanwhile goes for garage on his dub of to great effect the originals are very similar to what ali was producing before he went awol and every bit as well-produced the remixes all stand on their own two feet but its bodycodes typically individual version and seelies garage-inspired dub that stand out on this release
next up on records is a rare double pack the artist at the helm is motive and they call on the help of abagale fischer to lend her vocals to their cause to this release called a b e the double pack features remixes from the likes of grayarea and lovesky first up is the grayarea ulterior remix grayarea have been in a bit of form lately especially with their gravity single on hope doing good things they now appear on the fade label and turn in a pretty solid remix here this mix comes in at a good solid pace with driving beats emphasised by a deep gritty baseline grayarea have a good ability to work with vocals in their production as shown in the past and they make good use of the vocals here very much like gravity the grayarea lads have turned this into a bit of a progressive peak time monster and the result is very pleasing on the flip is the mototype dub and this mix turns he track into a dark twisted breakbeat extravaganza the beats are nicely paced with plenty of energy while the vocals interact nicely with the musical elements deep chunky baselines seem to rumble at the helm of the track giving it the sinister vibe it has throughout grayarea s ulterior dub again features many similar elements from their remix but this time the vocals are stripped away however they are not entirely absent snippets and cuts from the vocals are used quite nicely here as they blend into the beats quite effortlessly and as such work extremely well the track builds nicely taking off deep into the track with good intensity and it again works very well last but not least is the lovesky remix and they deliver quite a unique remix fro this package using delicate percussion the beats flow quite nicely alongside uniquely cut vocals the baselines ride deep in the track subconsciously giving it a good flow and groove and the melodies late in the track help give it a good warm vibe a pretty good release here for the crew with 4 pretty good remixes on offer of this very interesting track the vocals especially give the remixes plenty of interesting moments making this release worth a good look
the first release from new australian label eq grey limited comes from junkbeats pres headlands and their production headland consist of dave basek and sydney dj phil smart and support for their debut release has already come from tom stephen ando morris silicone soul and halo hipp-e just to name a few the release comes with an original mix as well as a reworking from alan barratt the original mix is on the a-side and it begins with some nice delicate percussion it s quite a laid back track with a deep but quite subtle baseline and some trippy effects some infrequent vocal lines and piano undertones also appear making this a perfect early night warm up session the alan barratt mix on the flip lifts the tempo up just a little but most importantly adds a lot more funk with the baseline as it gives the track a great boost and flow the piano lines form the original play a role in the remix as does the quirky percussive elements all in all this is quite a good release for this new venture which by this first release looks to cater for the aficionados that eq grey doesn t quite do
has described his past releases for entracte as exploring a/rhythm space silence and pulse this approach continued on last years clap for where to now may sound familiar inspired by the likes of mark fell young computer music enthusiasts have spent the last few years doing something similar cornish who has been active for over a decade goes further than most in removing comfort and convention from synth and percussion loops the effect is powerful if not always pleasant on the ears his ep for rabits deploys that uncomfortable power for a particular purpose the agenda is set by opener in which a slurred downpitched voice repeats in it is illegal to be gay in approximately 75 nations and regions around the world the flat robotic voice and the vacant synthetic drone behind it seem void of emotion which makes the message grimmer voices elsewhere on the ep are harder to decipher on we get the phrase looking out the window uttered apathetically over sour metallic percussion and slow drums on the closer cornish tells us something about imperial china though its half-lost in a nightmare of burbling voices and meandering kicks and claps the lack of further explanation suggests cornish wants our minds fixed on his bleak opening message (maybe is to 21st century homophobia what babyfathers stealth intro the looped phrase of this makes me proud to be british was to nationalism in the uk ) tracks like and ultra-sparse constructs of unadorned drum hits lock you in their cold unflinching gaze only with its bolder melody and grime-like rhythm makes concessions to musical convention
three tracks from and a remix from gesloten the mysterious dutchman who snuck into ras top 50 tracks last year despite just a few solo records to date pretty exciting stuff on paper leads off the a-side sporting punchy drums and the increasingly popular 4/4 clap pattern its a strange beast with bottom-dwelling synths oozing their way up through the gaps in percussion and ghostly exhalations filling out the background fans of may be surprised how schizophrenic it all seems though the tracks turbid gurgles and moody drones are arranged in a simple repetitive sequence the constant jumps between their disparate timbres can make it seem otherwise at is more straightforward possessing a similar feel to overlay paul roses recent joint under the scb guise helmed by yelps of tensile synth it thumps along to no where in particular feeling more like a tool than a fully-fledged track on the other side the eponymous cut is steeped a little further in boris bunniks dub-heavy past times he lathers elements so vigorously in delay and reverb that they obscure the track like a swarm of angry bees its not just the effects that recall dub however; the lead motif is constructed using that oh-so-popular steely synth moving along in asymmetrical leaps it imparts a more lasting impression than at but still lacks the spark found in bunniks best tracks in contrast gesloten s remix is full of fire opening with a kassem mosse enchilada -inspired vocal it moves quickly into a spindly and unusual string melody repeatedly climbing the scales over a walloping beat the sequence has a faintly eastern feel (middle or far i cant tell) its not clear where either of these key elements came from but the end result is strong enough that most people probably wont care
one way to run a label is to locate an interesting sound or idea and track it as it spreads across genres continents and perhaps decades few recent labels have done this as well as whose catalogue includes bizarre reggae (a reissue of traditions captain ganja and the space patrol ) japanese illbient (aquadab mc a) and the unique seekersinternational all connected by an oblique vision of dub the connection is more tenuous on the south london labels latest a member of tokyos self-described post tribal dj unit chopstick killahz makes spartan rhythm tracks steered by international club currents rather than deeper dub flows and his lucid dreams ep echoes ballroom house and the droning menace of gqom but dancehall is also in the mix on patois is looped and choked with reverb over a the bug-style death march beat and dubs subtractive logic might inform the suffocating empty spaces these spaces are what makes stand out his tracks run in slow motion their sparse endlessly looping grooves evoking grinding dread theres something a bit doom metal about this made explicit in the snarling low drones of this can make for heavy listening the ep runs to 36 minutes and some of the less commanding tracks like shamans labour the point but with its tolling bells and bullet-time snares and in which club music clich s suffocate at 110 bpm are stark and gripping
s starts out as unimpressive in almost every way which makes it all the more impressive in the end makeup of it is simple elemental house with a seething sense of mood and lots of space left bare its simple at the start but over time the parts grow hypnotic slinky kind of dirty and lascivious for the steamy heat they start to accrue flip side of this third part of a series marking the fifth anniversary of arcelona-based label galaktika takes a similar tack though goes bigger and thicker more filled out from the inside than sketched in on the margins great gloppy kick drum sound gives the whole thing weight and then some quasi-tambourine shakes slither in to disperse the mass of it otherwise a few reflective chords suggestive and psychedelic do minimal duty in terms of melody and make room instead for the drums to go more crazy and deranged as it stretches on
in a recent interview with fact planet mu boss mike paradinas expressed relief that are with s ep taking up the footwork baton in fact the appearance of the scene figurehead on kode9s imprint has a whiff of inevitability to it kode9s sets have been laced with footwork for some time and his forthcoming single xingfu lu draws heavily on the style still its gratifying to see the sound forge further onto uk soil and seems the best man for the job the producers recent output has become crisper the hooks bolder and the structures more involved a refinement that displays an awareness of his growing global audience the eps title track is a case in point an expertly fractured r b ballad underpinned with a halftime lope drawn from hip-hop produced with frequent collaborator follows a similar blueprint but is even more brilliantly soppy elsewhere the producer tips a nod to londons rich musical heritage in the jungle stylings of masterful breakbeat editing at the opening coupled with diva samples and aqueous string pads would almost make it a pastiche exercise were it not for a clipped agitated quality thats inimitably footwork finally with uses breakbeats to more deranged ends though really its just a canvas on which to paint an excellently garish synth melody rarely has footwork sounded so assured
swedens not just about banging loop techno and an all-embracing welfare state these days however it is all about pretty melodies who get more popular with each new release have a real knack for them as evidenced by their last 12 girl from botany bay its no surprise that the duo started out releasing trance records under the name son kite - there is still a definite trance influence in their sound however thankfully this aint trance it s progressive house in the most literal sense of the word the title track builds logically and steadily using a fairly basic rhythmic foundation but this basic foundation is soaked even drenched in euphoric cottony synths which add successive layers of melodic counterpoint until the overall effect is almost unbearably sweet bit like those indian desserts that are deep-fried and then served in a little puddle of sugar syrup euphoric it certainly is but it lacks a sense of real release after the artfully constructed breakdowns this may not matter as the shimmers and pirouettes of the build-ups seem to have been mathematically calculated to stroke the synapses of ecstasy users into a state of priapic bliss it s easy to imagine that at a happy summery party this track could be the precursor to one of those moments where everyone s feet seem to be floating two feet above the dancefloor dont bother with the flip which uses cookie-cutter minimal percussion to fairly irritating effect and lacks the melodic hooks of straightforward builds and progressions of the -side manage to be charming despite their obviousness but lacks its puppy-ish enthusiasm and so ends up just being boring i can t get thoroughly excited about as their records always seem to lack a definitive groove beyond a 4/4 backbeat however you really can t fault in that it certainly achieves the effect its aiming for fans should pick this one up

are outsiders in metal a world obsessed with subgenres that doesnt always take kindly to those daring to colour outside the lines bassist and vocalist chip king and drummer lee buford both based in portland flirted with avant-garde structures on last years stunning ep master we perish and then tipped over into excess with its full-length follow-up christs redeemers which came with a string section and vocal choir as a result theyve found themselves on labels like thrill jockey rather than traditional metal outlets and their latest home is rvng intl which might seem unusual for music so primal and unhinged but then their fourth album also comes with an interesting twist: its produced by bobby krlic aka haxan cloak tri angles dark lord of noir electronics strips s music down to its darkest elements ir long passages of silence are more unnerving here and their crashing weight feels even heavier band wield their instruments with precision and krlics touch is equally careful you wont even know hes there until the thrash falls away to an uneasy thrum on the opening track on krlic compresses bufords spastic thrusts into sledgehammer bludgeons his fingerprints are most evident on here the bands gale force noise is channelled into surging techno think mika vainio before it slips off into a trap rhythm giving the chaos an unexpected slinkiness while king and buford make a point of exploring new avenues on they also return to their sludgy doom metal roots on and scratchy vocals ride the groove like howls lost to the wind their meaning buried beyond comprehension moments like these recall early black metal where sonic clarity gave way to the sheer force of terror that spirit lives on in an album whose sophisticated approach belies its pure nihilism most violent thing about is how krlic demolishes the duos sounds into fragments buford and king dont sound like a band so much as dismembered parts rebuilt into golems made from blood sweat and circuitry onslaught we heard on christs redeemers is replaced by a more drawn-out sense of composition crafting towering monuments of distorted bass and howling noise is a record that occupies several niches at once tal techno and noise fans will all find solace here as the band juggle sounds from all three to make something that sounds new and almost natural
is a new local australian label for their first release they call upon renowned sydney-based based electro and hip hop dj and producer mako to team up with 2001 bedroom bangers winner and breakbeat maestro bass kleph and the result like abort juan original and radio edit like abort juan bridges the gap between deep tech-house and electro with elements of breakbeat thrown in quirky vocal stabs make up a cheeky hook one that ll be hard to forget even when the needle is off while the bass line morphs through various guises and melodies sounding like a buzz saw at one point on top of this mako bass kleph complete the recipe with stirring synths and counter melodies to compliment the hook the tune itself progresses through various phases so it s hard to actually tell you re listening to the same tune mako bass kleph delta mix the first delta mix transforms the tune into a harder edged 4-4 housebreaks affair the bassline is given a little more aggression compared to the original making this one suitable for fans of the tribal breaks sound (meat katie soul of man etc ) towards the end the track slowly anti-climaxes slowly removing elements for a nice wind down andrew maher delta mix andrew maher s mix starts off on a highly syncopated 2-step tip before returning the 4-4 house beats to the track then going back to the 2-step beats that introduced the tune it s similar in feel to mako bass kleph s delta mix with a little more syncopation in mind it s a pity it s so short and ends so abruptly after being blown away by previous tunes like bass kleph s dance with me and mako various work on albums like the first mother tongues release a team up of these two minds should result in nothing short of genius like abort juan lived up to my expectations it s a catchy tune done well

a digital sub-label of fuse london was set up in march last year to release more material from the influx of music landing on the desks of enzo siragusa and co while the first three releases shined a light on lesser-known artists affiliated with the party the fourth release starts with an ep from a regular guest and less are both examples of the dubby house fare that works at fuse parties the former leads with cutting kicks and a muscular bassline completing the offering with intermittent spells of spoken samples and muted whistles ll in all its a tidy club track less is less incisive though evoking s housier la pe a moniker through its loose claps latin vocals and live crowd noise if that sounds like a dated combination thats because it is
s latest ep is a collection of well-designed warm simple techno tracks that will sound massive on any system theyre played through and both feature a single minor chord hit in a syncopated pattern accompanied by side-chained white noise and energetic hi-hats meanwhile eroded drones fade into balance with the bounce of the percussion rndm stands out as the highlight of the release creatively pairing a subtle rolling groove with the type of four-on-the-floor clap pattern weve come to expect from producers like jonas kopp combines thick bass-heavy kicks with an almost breath-like airy noise sweep flowing in and out the ep as a whole seems to follow in suit with what weve heard from dvs1 ben klock and other purist techno producers recently simply put these tracks sound forceful and full and are an example of s mastery of the style and his passion for the classic techno aesthetic however one cant help but wish that would apply these keen production skills to something other than classic dance floor bangers and nostalgic reveries earlier this year tracks like his goliath second trail on figure stood absolutely unforgiving and were haunting in a way that few could imitate by comparison the ep gives the impression that may have been playing it a bit too safe this time
s part of has flourished alongside henry wu mo kolours and the rest his music is another variation on the south london crews soul-drenched sound in contrast to say the beat miniatures of l dobson jr he prefers to stretch things out over long periods his loosey-goosey grooves and stoned soul chords showing no desire to get anywhere fast this approach lent itself well to a sprawling ep on yoruba last year but this follow-up for feels like too few ideas stretched too thin obs is mostly just that ccumulating layers of loose hi-hats shakers congas and triangle it slouches way back against a drum machine thoughtful rhodes chords hold the thing together later helped by a squiggly bassline ut the restrained two-chord progression isnt exactly a show-stealer and when a cool lead soars in for a midpoint solo it feels like weve jumped from the intro to the breakdown without getting the meat in between ll is also a couple minutes too long though theres more to it: a voice riding over another motley crew of drums and some wonderful starry-eyed chords straining to break free of the basslines earthbound thump

resisting the urge for louder faster harder that tarnishes so much modern drum bass spectrasoul have developed a dense clinical style that nevertheless possesses the grit and energy necessary to move dance floors this is their second appearance on critical a label known for quality control and an eagerness to shun fads and tired categories neither straight dance floor fodder nor lazy liquid-funk its a rich and satisfying release exemplifying spectrasouls minimal-yet-expressive style on side break turns his hand to remixing spectrasouls 2008 smash libi a minimalist destructive and supremely bass-heavy track that became an instant favourite among the scenes self-styled underground when it came out last ugust prolific producer break is already a hero of the scenes new school with a string of hits and an album to his name on libi he applies his signature natural drum sound replacing spectrasouls restrained two-step with a crisp rolling drum break interspersed with fragments of percussion his arrangement loses the sparseness of spectrasoul and gains the warmth of breaks analog production desk and organic sound breaks remix is less explosive on the dance floor but more emotive and joyous than spectrasouls track not quite what youd call liquid but not quite the opposite either on the flipside is a stripped-down bare and cold track distinct from breaks work in its lack of shuffling rhythms if break is warmly organic is cold metallic otherworldly heavily distorted vocal sample commands the tune its menacing rasping voice sounding like the robotic overlord of rave addressing his minions in some respects this tune fits with the so-called minimal sound currently being championed by artists such as data and dbridge but whereas minimal often sounds empty not just of sounds but of ideas is full of depth and energy
brief was simple: take a david bowie song any david bowie song and do what you want with it twelve artists who claim to have been heavily influenced by thin white duke responded and have done their best to go beyond as it were title course is a reference to bowies on but it also nods to his prevailing interest in all things alien and pushing oneself past the normal e these reinterpretations certainly goes out there (and ends up in a place far beyond the fourth planet) but for the most part yond draws out different aspects bowies multifarious character(s) and along with being very enjoyable serves as a tribute to his gift for self reincarnation eccentric who more than anyone has claim to be dukes representative on earth/grandson nails the bowie persona most people know somewhere between ziggy stardust and thin white duke his cover is operatic theatrical and gives you the feeling he knows exactly what hes doing (and wants you to know) without becoming ironic injects an enormous synthcore bassline and disco stabs whilst singing in a faux machismo voice which for some reason is in a variety languages it retains the campness and daftness the original but bonds bowieness with s eye for the proto retro futuro disco dancefloor achieve something similar with their wistful italo interpretation the although as far as im concerned its all about baby dancing and saying: hell yeah five the artists take bowie downtempo and the most successful is s version oh by removing the grand bombastic choruses the song becomes cuter and intimate like a fireside favourite singer erika sters childlike vocals lend a delicate tone and manage to make the songs theme nietzsche and/or an alien race subsuming humans on earth sound dreamy three other artists explore bowies groove with punk funk reworks s rejig wouldnt have been out place on ze back in the 70s sounding somehow modern yet old at the same time nd the contribution from no stranger to the dance/guitar crossover is also impressive ironing out the up and down in a wn in favour constant tempo ll these come across as terribly earth bound in comparison to version on however which bears no relation to the original at all haphazard choruses creaking doors hands squeezing balloons and distant machines retain only the barest relic bowies tune weird thing though is that by straying furthest from the source material embraced the challenge the albums concept more than anyone else which brings us to and two the producers who are making some the most forward thinking electronic music around their contributions are depressingly polite both tinker a little: s for cover is slower and more melancholy; s and less funky but more sweet this is a criticism that to varying degrees could apply almost to the entire project aside from and part you really wonders what yond would have sounded like had k7 assembled a dozen artists that didnt cite bowie as a massive influence just imagine if the likes ppleblim techre i f jeff mills or flying lotus were given the run bowies catalogue i dont know if it would make for a better compilation but there certainly would have been more surprises along the way
s dimension d album which was released last june on continues to provide riches for remixers is a piece of typically esque sound design pregnant with atmosphere and cloaked in mystery like some guillermo del toro fantasy handed to gerd janson and phillip lauer it mutates into smoky acid with increasingly invasive squiggles jerky snares and spanking electro beats on his remix flu gel fashions some delightfully sprawling moody house it sits on the backburner a simmering pot of muffled bass tear jerking pads and percussion thats reduced to a whisper the result is a drowsy but devastating bomb
re is a phenomenon lets call it tical llusion synchronicity syndrome (p ss) which involves the belief that bubblegum dance music is preternaturally profound and directly addressed to ones specific life events usually p ss is totally erroneous and stems from the generic nature of certain feelings the excitement of meeting someone new the sorrow of saying goodbye ts been the bread and butter of pop songwriters from the platters to the proclaimers from tin pan alley to the neptunes s mal mastered the art of making listeners believe they have p ss dont is in every way the equal of mal synths are deep and luxuriant hearkening to kylies cuts sophie ellis-bextors arrangements this record blows newjack la roux off the surface of the bubblegum earth track thats doing it to me is of ( does it hurt to hear your songs on the radio ) for a person like me who has an acute case of p ss using music as a status update from my heart to my head this cheesy ass pop song is a mainline to the confusion joy sadness and circularity of affairs of amore same deal a lost lover a searching u2 synth a great fucking bassline said our love cant change / all is said and done / to have you in my arms stupid pop music is precisely the best way to dodge clich and vapidity when talking about love because those clich s are the lingua franca of the realm and can thus be used to discuss serious shit standout dont band is the bubblegum of this record stuff you play / t sounds so pass / dont get me wrong / like you but dont like your is breaking up with him not because of some innate incompatibility of natures but because of the vagaries of pop taste whining get yourself a sequencer sounds unlikely yeah but just had a girl dump me for what seemed like irrelevancies of taste knows that in this era of facebook autobiography what you like and what youre into is more of who you are than who you actually are disclaimer: f you are feeling upbeat and looking for some driving girlvox electropop you should also get this album t works on that level obviously has a feathery esl-cool (think robyn) and she has some of the greatest kick drums youll hear in but m more of a p ss guy so if youre among the brokenhearted masses looking for something to spin as a private balm and a girlfriend manifesto you should probably get this album too sometimes tical llusion synchronicity syndrome is just what you need to get you through the bad times
this is the first in s blue riband choice series to concentrate on a particular venue with tony humphries funking things up in memory of club zanzibar one of the premier venues of the 1980s zanzibar became a legendary part of new jersey nightlife and was one of the main clubs to visit for the emergence of garage and us house music humphries musical personality comes over perfectly in this unmixed selection with some established classics rubbing shoulders with hard to find bootlegs making a desirable and beautifully packaged collection for the house connoisseur getting the party started with mass productions joyous welcome to our world the first cd moves through tyrees hard core hip-house the big voiced martha wash fronting todd terrys carry on and the blackbyrds catchy city life the intros in hamilton bohannons me and the gang could be construed as pretentious though curiously to end theres chers take me home an end of night newark favourite and to me by far her best song lys back to zanzibar opens up part two and i suppose you know your clubs made it when people are naming their tracks after you humphries choice cuts on this cd are from the gypsymen heaven and earth and cj cos sure cant go to the moon in an apt twist the final track is archie bells where will you go when the partys over overall i found the first cd more enjoyable and infectious than the second however both combine to make a great historical document and this is a choice well worth making particularly if you ever went to the zanzibar for those approaching from a modern viewpoint it might take a while to sink in stick with it though
at first blush visionquest-associated techno prankster matthew burtons recalls no track more than make up break up bruno pronsatos nico-sampling ultra-epic from 2009: both tracks push curiously sexy little grooves long past the point where practically every other techno or house producer would have started to wrap things up but where pronsato only implied a story arc burton makes the plot quite clear here and a good deal more whimsical: as the copy on s soundcloud reads is the tale of a homosexual pirate with a cross dressing fetish burtons occasional whispered narration aside though the concept doesnt really have much to do with the music murky heads-down tech house with just enough variation to make zoning in for the full 26 minutes a real possibility s and s and the push the story even further expanding on the sort of twistedly laid-back grooves that score the main event on a somewhat unrelated note matthew burton is joined on the flip by current collaborator of choice kate rathod for a pair of club tracks that are likely to feel far more familiar to you warm spacious and sensual its again recalls pronsato with its wide organic drums and less-is-more approach to melody nigels with its tart synths burrowing deep into the earth aims for something markedly darker though immersive neither track sounds particularly ambitious; of course theyd be hard-pressed to coming after burtons naughty pirate opus
deep house labels are many but brightons black key despite only launching in late 2011 is already one of the more reliable imprints around to date johnny cade ndy sh and chamboche have all served up nicely aged eps which rather than coming over as lifeless soundalikes showcased some genuine melodic artistry and dealt in enough idiosyncrasies so as to stand out from the crowd so too this new ep which calls upon three established but firmly underground talents each quite different from the next takes the first track having previously appeared with an ep all his own on underground quality that should give you an idea of his sound stripped grey scale and smoky but what marks him out on his own are the roughshod melodies he favours here a heavyhearted grainy piano hook lurks beneath serrated stabs as a subliminal deep house groove thuds below n up close male whisper adds intimacy to the otherwise dubby and shadowy affair making it as ripe for early evening as it is the dead of night following essential cuts for secretsundaze and cityfly finds toying with sketchy techno chords faint claps and thin icy synth lines to create a cavernous yet heady brew that bares all the hallmarks of levon vincents majestic elegance and dj qus seductive hypnotism no matter what boss completes the connoisseur package with a swirling moody joint lit up by a touch of disco melody and laced with late night atmosphere
when joey gonzalez or blush response first emerged nearly a decade ago the new york musician was writing dark synth pop songs with vocals his earliest material was heavily indebted to pioneering ebm bands like front 242 and skinny puppy a reverence that still holds true today his first three albums presented a modern take on industrial music albeit one rooted in traditional rock and pop songwriting gonzalez was also touring as a keyboardist for scar the martyr the heavy metal band founded by slipknot drummer joey jordison in 2015 he moved to berlin and the inevitable happened in the years since records for labels like ant-zen total black aufnahme + wiedergabe and have showcased a more techno-oriented sound as much in line with orphx as front line assembly thats because rhythm groove and mood remain key components in the blush response arsenal hes also broken free from rigid song structures his tracks writhe and twist through dark and noisy spaces taming the energy of gonzalezs fully improvised hardware performances without losing its wild impulse gonzalezs first full-length for adam xs label ably captures his musical evolution so far s first three tracks carefully ease you in the industrial soundscape on each one is clear but the melodies do a lot of the work a shift occurs about halfway through when billowing synth clouds erupt in noisy crescendos of distortion its a premonition of evil things to come starting with named after the japanese doomsday cult responsible for the 1995 tokyo subway attack the tracks stinging synths grumbling bass and electrified notes quickly evolve into a maelstrom with vocal samples and dramatic chords caught in the crosshairs the lp punches hard and heavy from here on in is the only vintage-sounding track here with its clanking 80s mechanics and synth blasts escaping like stream the rest of the album works industrial signatures into a more contemporary club vernacular as on the albums merciless peak-time weapon of all the ebm-inflected techno records to emerge this year is one of the best
solo productions have been thin on ground of late fresh for however erlin-based producer debuts on joined on vinyl-only labels tenth release by wax fiends italojohnson who appear with ir first remix parker wastes little time in introducing youre s defining elements: a balmy haze of synths glistens against a backdrop of stringent kicks and hi-hats beautifully well-measured bassline underpins key components which are stripped away at breakdown to ensure maximum impact when y return in pure summery bliss italojohnson on o r hand deliver a slice of mechanized tech house albeit one with enough depth to be thoroughly captivating layering hefty basslines salient lyrics and cosmic chords over a rolling frame one shouldve known italojohnson would proffer something that doesnt sound like a remix at all
theres something about that suggests the swedish duo are a cut above your average deep house practitioners releases on get physical circus and culprit are evidence that some of the bigger names in their market agree theres a satisfying warmth a sentimental touch about the rich analogue grooves and elemental melodies that eiad sayegh and hannes netzell construct it may sound like the name of ikeas plastic colander range but is gorgeous: tumbling bass keys punch out the rhythm as a looping piano sample and fizzing snares bathe everything in a hypnotic glow finds the stockholm producers toughening things up and taking things deeper with a trippy single-note motif acting as a tracer bullet work in dabs of acid and hushed unintelligible background vocals pulled into ever-darker waters by a heavy throbbing undertow
us based label return to action with a remix package of badhatu a production from the combined talents of dan morris shylock already seeing airplay from john digweed on his kiss fm show it seems that are on to another winner with 2 very solid remixes the chris fortier kolo edit begins with some nice tribal influenced drums and some sweeping percussion effects all before a deep groove filled baseline gives the track a real dancefloor feel the first half sees the focus on effects and hypnotic sounds as the track takes a turn midway in with the introduction of a 3 note baseline that is quite simple but very effective i nice edit by the duo that is sure to please those who like it deep the randall jones stairway to the gods remix follows and it is quite simply a beautiful piece of work it begins smoothly enough with delicate flowing strings and a simple enough melody the kick comes in shortly and gives it a flow as the production then rides effortlessly for a few moments the breakdown midway sees some atmospheric effects take control combined with some very subtle vocal samples it s typical randall jones brilliance a good release here for with the randall jones mix the highlight; despite the fortier kolo edit being quite strong in itself
a large majority of dance music relies on the narcissism of small differences call what a producer does a disco retread and theyll let you know that the kick drum was taken from a polka record when you only have a few genuine innovators around these are the things that seem important to point out thats not a bad thing necessarily polka drums are more distinctive than you might think so is the melody that plays throughout three a track from s new ep for which seems lifted directly from photeks the hidden camera devoid of that context you might find it to be just another deep house tune with it an unlikely connection between deep house and drum bass is drawn photeks house phase is immediately called to mind and if you loved the original youll likely either be excited or disgusted by its use here i tend toward excited but perhaps that has to do with the context of enjoying just about everything else on in days of old pt 1 too three turns photeks crashing avant drum bass into a melancholic lament that has some bounce in its step two sees stefanik bringing his dub techno talents to the table wrapping an infectious riff in enough cushion to make it go down easy and one submerges its organ for long enough that when it surfaces with the requisite oh yeah and polite strings youre already moving too much to wonder exactly where that kick came from originally im sure if you asked stefanik hed be happy to tell you because while it may not be all that innovative in days of old pt 1 has plenty to offer
for those unconvinced or simply confused by s ongoing obsession with footwork s debut album should provide answers while muzik is no less an authentic footwork collection karlis griffins tracks are layered with ideas and inspirations that go beyond the mangled hip-hop of peers like rashad spinn and roc and fits in quite well with the rest of the catalogue bleedthrough tendency is all over the album: not only does opener slice up its vocals into a frenetic rush but it throws them on top of slowed-down housey chord stabs so that every strata of this music is moving at different speeds simultaneously armed with higher production values (or maybe just more patience) than his chicago cohorts diamonds tracks vary from lush (the jazzy orchestral cut-ups of and u ) to threateningly spare ( dat ) a mixture of effects and a byproduct of his sample-based technique griffins percussion is uncommonly detailed and meticulous a compilation like mus bangs works (on which diamond was featured) figured footwork as part of the dialogue by way of its extremity and experimentalism but muzik seems to reference other musics even more directly try not to hear early grime in the naked horns and slicing snares in and (where the sliding percussion feels like a slap in the face) lush post-dubstep in the chopped-and-screwed synth swells on or techno in the sped-up thump of f you wanted to m sure you could even find explicit dubstep affinities all over the album as most of griffins herky-jerk rhythms have some sort of mutant swing embedded deep in their elaborate configurations muzik s best moment is its centrepiece the three-minute whirlwind of which melts a trance-tinted liquid chord progression into molten turbulence griffins restless roaming music should satisfy anyone still wondering why mu is so into this footwork business: dicing up techno grime bass and everything else into footworks bite-sized beats is exactly the legendary labels modus operandi and sits comfortably with some of the labels best albums of the past few years

fun of a dj mix series comes from the actual quality of the mixing track selection obviously but also from the visual aesthetics that fabric-sponsored vague belonging feeling it helps conjure bugged out s series for example was able with both ivan smagghe mian lazarus s respective mixed albums to evoke some sort of typically european coolness (at least from the north american perspective) all but enhanced by the dj-wearing-his-own-t-shirt self-referential cover art with the third installment of the series (coming out unexpectedly almost two full years after the last one) are aiming at everyone who enjoyed their famously distorted genre-bending sets at fabric s let s kill em all monthly nights gone are the cool t-shirts though now replaced by giant eyes taking a look at current trendy n -electro-rave artists ( de the ubiquitous ) no-so-current influences ( ) in the most effective of fashion y have been at it for a while now (if you count their days as bucolic electronic folklorist ) it shows both in terms of tastes skills for example the way s of morphs into s before leaving place to s mammoth is nothing short of impressive alter ego remix of art s too even helps to create invisible links between german hedonism london s own histrionic mayhem n at some point early in the mix smd chooses to go from fat s seminal hip house track called errr to retro-sounding then to their own current single it s the you can actually hear their agenda loud clear: their could be seen less of an artistic statement in itself than an appetizer for their proper artist album to be released a bit later this summer turns out the self-reference is now in the mix itself instead of being simply photographed added on top of it which is i guess just another way of self-representing you know in the end it is like smd somehow wants you to hear where they re musically coming from what decks they were always sucking on: therefore what the mix gains in energy level it loses somehow in upfront spontaneity something that could never have been proclaimed about both smagghe or lazarus that said this shouldn t be held against what is otherwise a still-relevant dj mix series (at least for now) an amusingly self-conscious duo of producers

andr may work in the shadow of studio partners and fellow norwegian artists prins thomas todd terje and lindstr m but not because his music cant stand on its own more prodigy than prot g carved out a corner of space disco for himself with a confident debut lp in 2013 this follow-up record continues to build from that place in subversive and satisfying ways its all much darker this time around with making nods to techno and noise alongside the usual house and disco is billed as an ep but at nearly 40 minutes the record approaches album length it has the scope for it too sounds familiar tying big rubber-band basslines around hand drums claps and a bit of stardust simple stuff to be sure but with a hearty payoff digs deeper into druggy undertones on andr it seems to use the feel of jon hopkins open eye signal as a jumping off point from which to sketch space disco in a moody new light that kind of hyper-detailed emotive dance music colors the eps second half: and is a flickering ray of graceful melody next to the blackened grit of and oslo producer shows a formidable range of styles here hell do well to continue s train of thought onto the next album
eric estornel has worn many masks over the course of his near two-decade career after spending most of the 00s making gritty electro as mariel ito and mechanised techno as maetrik he eventually found fame at the end of the decade as a housier more summery alias that dovetailed with the boom of labels like hot creations and crosstown rebels in 2011 the latter released estornels debut album index whose most famous track is a stevie wonder cover but despite the success of index estornel wasnt entirely comfortable with its sound i felt like an artisan and not an artist you know someone who makes something to order he told me in 2015 nevertheless he continued with the project steering it in a tougher big-room direction via fist-pumping anthems like conjure balearia and conjure dreams this felt like estornel trying to find a sweet spot between and maetrik which hed set to one side in 2012 formula worked and somewhere along the way he became one of dance musics biggest stars when the time came then to start thinking about that difficult second album you might have expected estornel to play it safe and write an lp stacked with tech house weapons but instead as he told me during that same interview it would incorporate more of that [techno and experimental side] without scaring people too much se were the words of an artist with a point to prove he also became a father around this time an experience he says heavily influenced the record album is named after his son certainly shows a new side to but theres little to get excited about here more than anything its the vocals which appear on more than half of the 11 tracks that let it down yve been a constant feature of estornels productions over the years often deployed expertly ( this cut a favourite of ricardo villaloboss is a prime example) but on theyre mawkish in tone and lyrically corny transforming otherwise solid tracks into songs that are hard to stomach twanging synths on have a nice thing going until a cloying vocal breaks through: i feel my heartbeat heavy / when gravity takes hold of me res no need for the vocoder vocal on either the tidy framework of post-punk kicks fuzzy earworm melody and trance-y pads more than stands up on its own things improve on the instrumental tracks keplers is a glitchy breakbeat bomb full of left turns and the kind of dreamy pad work that dj metatron built his name on by some way the albums most understated track pairs light drums gossamer pads and a fleshy synth line to stirring effect estornel exercises similar restraint on closing cut constructing a moody dub-inspired workout that ambles gracefully at 110 bpm se tracks show what hes capable of when the brushstrokes arent so thick is a flawed attempt to reconcile estornels two musical worlds: before and after in other areas of his career this approach has proven more successful his residency at pacha ibizas famously glitzy super club merges the usual heavyweights with headsier acts like pearson sound avalon emerson and derek plaslaiko introducing the largely uninitiated ibiza crowds to cutting-edge music but a club night and an album are two very different beasts in 2015 estornel told me he wanted to be a statement a record that would show his audience that theres more to him than just 4/4 bangers its syrupy tone undermines the point hes trying to make
the duo of kenneth_lay and jason carr are among a small cluster of artists in philadelphia currently applying their histories in the us noise scene to raw and psychedelic takes on techno former is also one half of metasplice who run a similar line in scrambled radio interference and swarming high-pitched bleeps beyond that any concrete information about the duo is refreshingly difficult to come by though expect that to change soon enough: theyve signed an upcoming release to trilogy tapes and are about to follow up this debut with a second 12-inch for an informed guess would suggest that the duos compositional approach resembles that of metasplice where a network of hardware and effects units is used as the basis for live recorded on-the-fly improvisation all five tracks have a distinctly hand-controlled feel you can practically hear parameters being tweaked in real-time across opener a background cloud of harmonics repeatedly billows into the foreground forming a series of successive peaks each one higher than the last tension is finally released six minutes in when the track explodes into full flight above a booming four-to-the-floor kick drum before swiftly dissolving into showers of static panicked drum machines of make it the hardest hitting thing on here by a considerable margin; at the surface it spits hisses and arcs like an overhead cable gone haywire elsewhere the mood is more restrained though no less caustic and in a both sound as though the tape theyre recorded on has been frazzled by radiation exposure latter is particularly striking a single lead line plays a sad trumpet-like melody but its a ghost presence in the rough grain of its environment where surface distortion and grinding low-end threaten to swallow it up entirely
the impressive th g about the title track from s new out g on is how alive it sounds especially given the dist ctly un organic qualities of its dividual parts it should by rights be bland and un spir g instead chatter g hi-hats that sound like a troupe of sects franticly chew g their way through speaker cables and synth stabs that shimmer and contort like the frame of a steel drum give it an pleasantly accessible natural feel irenes kicks off with what sounds like a dawn chorus of click g arthropods but quickly becomes dom ated by a judder g staccato beat and overused and underdeveloped hats fares better much better fact; the sparse piano lead and live-sound g chords add fragility to a powerful bassl e its hardly the k d of music you would immediately associate with a heady few weeks spent sipp g w e (no doubt) heel of italy but you can see what hes gett g at
like zomby or actress makes episodic provisional tracks that weave together multiple strands of electronic music to create something distinct with ott rave synths and spindly staccato rhythms the italians work is firmly on the contemporary bass music spectrum but as might be expected of a producer who is also one-third of arty experimentalists one circle its layered with chewy detail you could compare him to early rustie or fatimi al qadiris ethereal grime but takes his own peculiar route to that sound the producer born daniele mana created while thinking about how our bodies exist in the digital realm there is a clearly alienating atmosphere to and its eerie choral interjections and the elusive sweetly chattering voices that reverberate through feel as if theyre lost in binary code these murky tracks are in part tapestries of heavily processed vocal samples which as well as being nebulous (is it a synth or a sample ) give manas music a disembodied quality stripped of intellectual context however resonates for purely sonic reasons the east asian jungle vibe of is beautiful and his use of rhythm is fascinating mana deploys grimes machine-gun beats and elements of dancehall and footwork but in contrast to his more fluid contemporaries his methods are gritty and visceral meanwhile his enormous warped synths reminiscent of new order at their most pompous or major label hip hops trap-influenced grandstanding are by turns exhilarating and bordering on bad taste ultimately presents ideas that mana has yet to fully realize but his voice remains singular
like many newcomers to techno these days mehmet irdel has a background in noise and power electronics unlike many of his peers however irdels past life comes through as a constructive rather than destructive force his techno has a brutal thrust thats evened out by his ear for detailed sound design and wide-open soundscaping on of irdels second release for he crafts two ten-minute odysseys in the vein of 90s techno institutions like downwards and dynamic tension but upgraded for with a dazzling sense of detail the kick drums on the title track are pounding but never suffocating in fact over its long build is remarkably spacious even when the kick comes barreling back in after the breakdown the track feels fluid and in control with all kinds of percolating sounds rolling and clanging over the top is built with the same gift for layering that irdel showed on his recent r podcast is equally well made this time with a long melancholy synth line draped across the back half making it the emotional counterpart to the stoic -side the result feels both alien and beautiful for someone who only made the move to techno recently l t te already sounds like a natural
if youre a fan of contemporary prog then dream teams probably dont get much bigger than the new project from john digweed nick muir and guy j the first two names have been collaborating since 1993 while the latter has been somewhat of a digweed prot g the past five years having released two albums and a handful of singles on bedrock accordingly z sounds like a meeting between old and new on the one hand it clocks in at near ten minutes long and has that wild almost tribal feel which infused so many tunes in the 90s on the other you have techy percussion and an extravagant break the latter of which constitutes the tracks centrepiece here jarring chords are briefly soloed before the beat dramatically takes hold again its a moment crowds will love even if it is a little obvious outside of this however the tracks sleek structure and eerie understated hooks are sound the dub is more subtle excising the fist-pumping break and slicing a minute from the duration though neither version may be field-toppers theyre certainly good enough to satisfy expectations
last years clean-cut found amsterdams juju jordash on bright and vivacious form in musical terms the jazz-loving duo havent always been straight talkers but in this case a bit of directness was a boon the pairs return to follows a similar plan ir meandering synth work is still the main attraction but they keep a firm grip on house convention too title track is the most grounded of the lot its beefy kick drum webbed with dextrous synth arps floating up top is a voice presumably one of the pair getting his falsetto on variously cut into breathy loops or tracing more expansive melodies a dub version strips away the vocals to reveal the tracks steelier core; each version is solid though the inclusion of both feels slightly like too much of a good thing works with similar materials though this time the lead actor is a guitar whose gorgeous swooning chords work in counterpoint to the tracks tart synth lines finally is a tad darker and lacks that centrepiece element to focus its fidgety energy it doesnt help that its four-note bassline apes hit road jack juju jordash may be wizards behind the keyboards but even they cant teach new tricks to that old dog
while entities like perc trax and ancient methods are forging on with the mission combine techno with its occult-obsessed electronic roots ruaridh laws new(ish) imprint broken20 seems even more adventurous in its quest skirting the limits drone ambient dub and techno the labels restless tendencies are reflected in its third release the solo debut forward strategy groups patrick walker (as ) like its dreary cover art is unremittingly grey but its more an enveloping sort doom-and-gloom than an alienating one from the moment the drifting opener wafts in view the distant thumping techno can be heard in the back all that smoke and of meanwhile are sumptuously detailed odysseys through detritus clouds and magnetic fields ever-shifting and mutating gorgeous finishes without ever really going anywhere the ep takes an unexpected plunge in open air with which probingly plumbs dub techno depths familiar elements are slowed an ominously reverberating trudge think deadbeats recent material weighed down with apocalyptic murmurings tvos remix pulls as far away from its dub techno dressing as you could possibly imagine transforming the track in a lush 11-minute synth-led journey that combines the originals hefty thud with the clouded drone its first two tracks finally moving even farther away from the echo chamber is - an almost straightforward techno jam cut through with comparatively incisive chord stabs but still rendered in the dreamlike pallor that coats the whole ep
thanks to some choice remix commissions and as here some strong original house productions on well-regarded labels is compiling an increasingly impressive discography a year on from his ep for simple ewan smith shifts to its sister label aus for a group of tracks that show off his adroit handling of classic house and techno tropes is one of smiths darkest trips yet divebombing into heavy acid squiggles and crushing snares before bringing the mood straight back down with which like last years you tired shows some serious larry heard love the son of the title is perhaps wordplay as smith opens the drapes to allow shafts of soft-focus percussion to flood in its the perfect bed for emotional chords and a dainty synth melody to settle on finds smith continuing in a more plaintive mood its a soulful workout that rejoices in a disco bassline and frequent squalls of the synths after which its named the track is tastefully remixed by andr s who manages to wring every last drop of soul from it no surprises there then treating it with complex bass patterns and dots of rhodes to add another subtle shade to a vivid ep

christian hilscher and nico plagemann want to make you cry there s no other explanation for the chord changes that they used in ugust s connaisseur smash tristesse and there s no other explanation for the similar heartstring-pulling that goes on the -side to their newest 12 on diynamic the moment of blissful release comes a little less than halfway in as the track s bassline gives up its quick stabs casually turns into a drone and then unfurls into sweeping aching chords this undergirds two interlocking melodies continuing diynamic s trend towards a more harmonic dancefloor in the wake of such tech-house elegance and don t fare as well both are solid tracks but of little consequence draw is its lawrence-like compulsion towards proving melody is a rhythm too while works the same template but adds some light percussive flavor before pounding its way to a muscular conclusion there s a photo on the duo s myspace of them walking into the city night their pathway lit by a string of lights that seem to stretch into infinity it might just be the perfect visual representation for what their best tunes sound like then again they ve also got a design of two men in sport jackets standing inside a cloud with tv sets for heads so
label compilation is a peculiar beast most imprints seem content to shunt out a yearly update of their club smashers with tracklistings dictated by release schedule rather than any notion of flow or progression this mentality is particularly endemic in drum bass as back catalogues are regurgitated with unerring regularity a token acknowledgment of their non vinyl buying fans given the narrow scope of most junglist imprints such compilations tend to be stylistically narrow affairs with little appeal for anyone other than the most ardent completists tle audio though makes a conscious effort to position themselves as an alternative to the drum bass mainstream so its with a glimmer of hope that one approaches their debut compilation diametrically opposed to the trends of populist drum bass tle espouse an ethos that still holds breakbeat manipulation as the cornerstone of the genre volume one looks back upon the labels three year history and offers a peek into its future first unmixed disc opens as french newcomer goes widescreen with the bold orchestral stylings of his from cinematic strings guitars and chimes converge for a most unorthodox intro for a collection of drum bass t serves as an apt lead in for the direction of the compilation: then slides into the warped space jazz fusion of an interesting diversion that highlights the scope of the label but is perhaps not the most listenable moment of this release ts not until the third track that anything resembling conventional drum bass is heard s flurry of manic beat edits usher in the sound for which the label is most known densely percussive reworkings of classic breakbeats into epic soundscapes this style is writ large as equinox turns in an utterly sublime remix of by and duffah simultaneously rugged and grooving his intricate beat contortions give this track a thrust towards the dance floor that is missing elsewhere by has a gloriously old school vibe with ethereal vocals sparkling melodies and bird sounds and s is the twitchy glitchy drift into ambience that rounds out the first disc in the manner it began sitting on the outer peripheries of what drum bass can encapsulate second disc is a sixteen track mix by label head honcho who has put together an impeccable selection from the tle archives interspersing older material with snippets of forthcoming releases s deft touch in the mix is notable as the rhythmically busy nature of this sound can quickly sound akin to a pair of marching bands in a head on collision furthermore refuses to insult his listeners intelligence by simply rebundling the tracklisting of the first disc into a mix the default format for many drum bass label compilations nstead he offers a completely different selection resulting in a great showcase of the tle sound across the entire release volume one manages to strike a difficult balance oscillating between skewed experimentalism and material that may actually work in a dance floor context re is a genuine sense of craftsmanship that sees tle audio consolidate their position as purveyors of fine wanderings to the outer limits of the drum bass spectrum devotees of the label will have bagged this already but those with leftist junglist leanings could do far worse than to check out this comprehensive release
theres little doubt that deep introspective techno is what stockholm crew does best every once in a while though they drop a banger the latest lands on a double-ep from label founder the title track a polished acidic dance floor bomb is what should have most people reaching for the release it may well be rashims most high-impact original solo effort to date and a welcomed entry into the rave canon after years dishing out mellower sounds was first revealed during the final stages functions berghain 07 and was a standout selection on a standout mix it recalls a few similar high-definition bombs not least svrecas mountain splitter from earlier this year both can leave a lasting impression on clubbers with the potential if used wisely to be defining tracks the night this makes a must-buy for techno djs the rest comprises percussive deep techno in the tried-and-tested style and are particularly heady both built with chugging low-end and stuttering rhythms and sprinkled with a collage spacey sounds dor is more upbeat and perhaps the second-furthest thing from deep techno in the package it gives f an intangible punkish feel thats hard to attribute to a particular element but probably has to do with its clanging drums and what sounds like vocals reverbed into oblivion the past few years have seen rashim become something a background figure stepping into the shadows while the likes varg and cronym garner attention from techno circles packages like remind us that hes still a deep techno master with plenty to say
fter a strong start deep house dial sublabel has hit a hiccup or two along the way their second rick wade release revealed the detroit producer to be a lovely plagiarist of himself first darkness excepted (lovely but a plagiarist nonetheless ) s tribute to the smallville crew on its fifth catalogue entry meanwhile was harmless deep house fluff the label splits the difference on its latest thats hardly a surprise given that its a compilation of three tracks from three different producers nd it should perhaps come as no surprise that side is the best thing here the merican born producers shipyard deep house is in full effect lolling and swaying back and forth before a pounding beat comes in use of traditional deep house tropes the tinkling keys atmospheric synths etc are easy to hear but his unique arrangements have kept his productions sounding incredibly fresh the same cant be said for s whose title seems more like a hopeful plea than a declarative statement doesnt do much of anything here that hasnt been done before and better playing into exactly the sort of gripes that people have about the genre and its recent revival fred p k barely escapes such criticisms pplied is one of his least inspired tracks of the past 12 months there are enough nuggets going on beneath the surface to indicate to close listeners that a great deal of thought has gone into its making but unlike his great work from 2009 on structure you may not have as much reason to get there mild disappointment
s future thought made its debts clear detroit techno and chicago house were major uchs nes for the detroit-based producer and his highly emotional analogue tunes were seeped in his rical antecedents nonetheless fines admirers are among some of the most forward-thinking names in the techno field hence this remix ep featuring erlins en and god-knows-wheres oni yhun s remix begin as many of his compositions do striking out a fearsome and raw techno beat ut the producers house leanings rear their head quickly in the form of drawn out melancholic chords the titular phrase pans across the stereo field as well adding further momentum the tune but its the sleight-of-hand that puts in what begins like a very tired melody that impresses youll be ready pump your fist at a certain point but makes you wait just a bit longer than you think expecting the unexpected is par for the course with oni yhun and he provides a typically off-kilter remix of it sometimes sounds like yhun has put numbers in some sort of random melody genera r leaving the results up chance ut you can hear fines original chord change peek through the dissonance every so often reminding you that this is nothing if not a highly structured bit of mania yhun knows exactly what hes doing even if its hard from the outside figure out exactly what it is needless say its one of the most singular things youll likely hear this year
christian s newest record opens with the seaside cries coastal birds calls dont fade into the wind; they are devoured by chaos a squall machine-bits and canine growl be e settling into quiet lunar ambience its a series moments almost artless strangely disconnected in the way they sew together s intentions on as though seconds keen awareness are followed in due course by a kind blissful nullity a numbing deaf sound heard best in what the ears really missing following last years collaboration with ryuichi sakamoto cendre on which s talent discordant beauty was backseated by sakamotos dark stately piano playing is s first proper solo record since 2004s venice first thing you may notice about is just how gravelly it sounds; the records first half is s noisiest most disorienting work in years melodies and shimmers song occur less frequently appearing only in brief cloud-split moments that open up blue within dense prickly textures seems to be working the most part with a buzz and hush dialectic with freer and more prominent exchanges between loud/s t dynamics color almost stings its sharp beehive drone coming in bursts dissonance and amplified white crackle uses this small thunder more gently wearing at the edges acoustic guitar and wind-howl bell tones with noises like a small engine clattering with its tiny peastone symphony strings and a slow dinning push perhaps most resembles the endless summer ; its one the records more patient creations invoking the vaulted choir-spaces a composer like j hann j hannsson thinking back to its opening though the first seaward sounds not only set out its visual tapestry y mark its largesse this is his most oceanic record to date not its timbre but his mammoth wide-vista approach to each composition; its as if youre hearing something far too big from far too close and its difficult to decide what to focus on til something moves first gone so much its most important moments are the song-structures and direct appeals both endless summer and venice standout and album closer and have vague celtic undercurrents to their acoustic guitars and the latters foggy ambience and hazy shifts in tone but theyre more nuanced and sometimes undetermined in their patterns and this lack shape and m may make it difficulty at first some fans especially those his work post-2001 ultimately though its hard to imagine they wont come to love perhaps much like a parent a child ten unknowable temperaments more cherished his moodiness his difficulty
nick edwards is no spring chicken but his signing to last year brought fresh vitality to his music as this was largely down to the addition of a dash of tunefulness and colour dense murky and sometimes meandering compositions can be intimidating; letting a little light in made all the difference its that very difference that makes such a success though it doesnt exactly retread any of the ground covered on last years unfidelity instead its a kosmische epic: 12 minutes of a single four-note motif that plods mournfully round and round gently brushing the heartstrings on each revolution layers of rich countermelody drift in and out of focus and a globular midrange synth keeps an uneasy heartbeat pulse but that loop is the hook on which it all swings follows a similar blueprint but lacks a hook and is much harder to gain a purchase on a single arp flickers gently in the midrange for the first five-odd minutes before being joined by sheets of hiss and tiny curlicues of melody its all quite pretty but sprawled over a slow-moving 15 minutes may try your patience
as someone who only performs live s production energies are focused on honing new and existing material for his time on the road both tracks on the monique ep bring together stems from his latest mix album on cubism and transform them into fully realised tracks the rolling grooves and spoken vocal of recall free at last simons track from 2000 with booming kicks vocal snippets and a walking bassline the pressure builds until the vocal fully surfaces with a busy arrangement that reflects its live origins muscles in from the outset with distorted kicks handclaps and acid tweaks forming the tracks core slowly unwrapping layers reverb-drenched vocals muffled chords echoing high notes around the pattern of filter/drop/return allows the track to ebb and flow its intensity wobbles and escalates evoking the darkened rooms it could so readily inhabit
one gets the sense that torontos has a hard time sitting still despite its best efforts to evoke a certain laidbackness mcphees tunes perfectly up-to-the-minute post-dubstep burners have a difficult time not fidgeting as if they cant contain their excitement thus far its been infectious: on get in with you mcphees debut from earlier this year the excess energy found plenty of room to roam around inside a stepping beat now moving into more or less into straight house territory with a new 12-inch for ristol 4/4 agitators mcphee tries to capture the simmering murky vibe thats simultaneously made ctress and kassem mosse outsiders and favorites within house music big part of what makes tunes in this vein work is that their busyness congeals into a kind of thick sticky substance that seeps into the tracks empty spaces on / mcphee has all the right ingredients but never quite forms a unified haze has the strolling pace tin man ambience and woozy chords down pat but his cut-up vocal a vestige of his bassy roots makes cramped what should feel expansive is full of nice touches (that tiny piano hit just before the downbeat for example) but each is just a bit too crispy in its own right with every little drum pulling the track along its own axis it never quite goes anywhere mcphee certainly has the enthusiasm; now its just a matter of how and where to channel it
despite including many original productions on his recent renaissance: the mix collection set debut track for his brand new imprint didnt make the cut you only need to listen to a few seconds of this epic tracks 13+ minutes to hear why: just wasnt made for mix cd consumption largely beatless excursion into the outer worlds of cosmic synthdom its howells indulging every bit of his love for over-the-top gestures done tastefully of course and wringing every tiny morsel of drama he can out of its skyward-looking melodies you cant put this thing on a mix cd you need to hear the whole thing to get the point which is to say is an arms aloft moment one for slowly swaying back and forth as the music takes you elsewhere tangerine dream is a reference point so is williams 2008 cover of the dreams love on a real train ut perhaps that latter comparison is better suited to future eat lliances remix of f is in his element with wispy source material this is after all a producer thats put stuff out on delsin nonetheless f puts some meat onto s bones from the off with a sturdy tech house beat he hangs the synth lines on top of the framework watching how they interact with the beat and with each other y tracks end its just as involving as howells original and just as grandiose
raw uncompromising warehouse techno is the agenda for the dutch duo of pieter presk willems and felix lenferink their solo releases may have historically tied them to 2-step and house but theres no hint of that on s three tracks recorded using their own custom-built hardware this is music for the heads-down locked-in crew is built on a foundation of frantic kicks into which willems and lenferink layer gushing hi-hats hollow bass synths and drums that tighten and loosen on a giddying loop its a thrilling untamed stallion of a record thats already grabbed the attention of surgeon and ben sims will ink apply the funk on in contrast to the linear pile-driving -side the rhythm has more of a skip and the use of a cut-up vocal albeit heavily treated lends it a more organic feel the final most skeletal of the three tracks splices a fuzzy security-alarm pulse to a bassline that initially just lags behind the kick by half a second or so its a subtle technique that helps will ink turn something ordinary into something compelling
next up on the en soul imprint is fritz sieg under his alias and he turns in a strong tribal house record with saeed younan does his bit on the flip with a pretty solid remix first up though is the original mix and it is a pretty strong big room tribal house production solid beats as you would expect meet a gritty baseline as well as some pretty standard vocal lines for the first half the track builds with a solid build and set of breakdowns leading until the all action second half that erupts with beats the saeed younan remix is for me the better production of the two the track has quite a solid flow and a very strong groove with the rolling baseline uniting well with the effects and sounds that rattle alongside the beats a pretty good release here from en soul with both mixes offering some good moments throughout
things go bump in the night on a clink record over the course of three years and insideouts rooklyn/ erlin imprint has established its own unmistakable brand of steampunk minimalism rusty fans whir typewriters clack and telephones ring over heaving low frequencies is a perfect example of the labels trademark sound opening with a swollen techno breakbeat that rumbles through a dark alley of ominous fog echoing scrapes and voices caught in mid-gasp is built from the same oversaturated bass foundation with creaks and groans in the floorboards and a marble-mouthed voice just outside the window a squiggly sheet of aluminum provides the sole melody before the track breaks apart into a floor-stomping beat alexi s remix transforms the slow burning tension of the original into an intense piece of slice and dice powered by springy drums hard snares and lots of metallic claptrap after the bass doubles-up midway through things go from slightly eccentric to absolutely demented with modulators pushed beyond eleven and voices oscillating between growling and helium tones over the course of seven minutes transforms a quirky remix into a cartoon parody of the original digital exclusives are normally the killing fields for secondhand remixes but delivers a pair of tracks that are on par with the vinyl material alexi s second stab at is just as unhinged as his first outing but the dark and screwy palette works better here conjuring images of dennis hopper huffing laughing gas and hitting some nerves that havent been struck since d xs electric shock insideouts mix of offers more restraint and structure submerging the vocals and razor-blade synth beneath a river of knocking drums of the five tracks on this ep its the least likely to inspire a panic attack this record presents such a specific and focused sound that its difficult to make clear distinctions among the individual artists maybe its not important in the case of clink its all about mood
between boddika a host of other recent uk producers not to mention the test axis have you had enough of the 303 yet yeah well las zane reynolds one-upped everyone else went put acid right in his artist name but the young producer isnt just jacking chicago jack though his recent turn on 100 silk wasnt the most enlightening thing the label has released 2 a hodgepodge collection of bits from tapes left in r om places throughout the san fern o valley released on shows a more adventurous artist experimenting sometimes to his benefit sometimes to his detriment like a lot of the la dance-not-dance axis reynolds music gets by on an odd form of danceability the tracks here sputter cough in patterns that occasionally form discernible beats other times seem to map out rorschach patterns 2 has the flow of something cobbled together from scrap material with tracks bleeding into each other or abruptly rear-ending the next its like a collage of reynolds musical personality every bit as bright egregiously r om as something youd build from old magazines other media so where does the 303 part come in reynolds manages to subvert both the pulsating sexuality of acid house the near-funereal experiments of recondite test instead puts the squelchy noise in a more hypnagogic nostalgic context a few years ago (when these recordings were made) this might have been called chillwave we get a mixture of beat-driven tracks that stick acid melody lines in sweet suspensions ( s ) more brutal workouts like even better is the striking where an acid line teasingly licks at a drum machine going berserk in doubletime is most intriguing when he places those licks in the cool-headed muzak-y contexts of his best previous work on drums struggle to tap out a rhythm over decaying drones as a paradoxically chipper acid line gleefully gurgles on z b he layers them until they sound iridescent strange a sense of off-kilter harmony not usually associated with the 303 2 is anything but a coherent listen but its not meant to be in structure or execution in fact the album is most exciting at its most disjointed like the way dissolves into bleary-eyed incidental music or how z bb erodes into the archer machinery of speak his ideas are tangential scattershot but presented this way they become little eye-catching snatches of light entertaining before they disappear as quickly as they came despite its title 2 is by definition a throwback retrospective but it makes his future look bright or at least completely unpredictable which in a lot of ways is pretty much the same thing
s lhotel is a lesson in achieving a state of static sameness and churning variation at once it finds its groove early and hits its cruising altitude after a big buildup breaks at the 2:00 mark and then pretty much punches out from there gliding along on well-traveled tracks laid in the service of big steely tech house anthems past or does it for all the ways it sounds nicely zoned-out and increasingly lost in itself lhotel also cycles through an impressive arsenal of tweaks and turns layering in little percussive ticks and changing points of emphasis until the whole thing takes on a disorienting cork-screwing quality effect of it proves all the more alluring in contrast to a remix by ilario who capably makes it bang more but necessarily loses some of the subtlety at play in the original opposite dynamic factors into the b-side van dowskis version rumbles and bounds while s trims some of its trance-y excesses in a graceful reinterpretation full of mystery and intrigue plus a good infusion of drum sounds marked by that kind of grainy brainy villalobosian shiver and squirm
when gustav holst wrote his famed cosmological suite the planets in the early 1900s hadnt yet been discovered once it was found in 1930 the composer had long moved on 70 years later colin matthews wrote an amendment called the renewer in 2006 the international astronomical union kicked out of the planetary club compared to the magnitude of the solar system is an insignificant speck of debris even so it has its fans people rally to have it reinstated every year the tale of this blip of rock and ice is strangely heartwarming and that mix of hot and cold is at the core of s own la heat meets frigid uk grime on the second track of the veterans latest ep is a storm of synths strings bass wobbles and dark technoid glitches the accompanying picks up where mars left off at the start of this time danjah ramps up the orchestral drama with squealing horror strings and hackle-raising sounds as chilling as those in mica levis under the skin soundtrack and its all powered by a fierce arsenal of metallic trap beats this big bold instrumental demands tough bars to match
while there are plenty of promoters that tread the well-worn path of scaling their sound from the club to the festival the reverse of this group is much less populous for london trio disko who launch their eponymous label and party in the capital in early december their history comes from years of playing as far afield as brazil australia spain germany and uk stalwarts such as glastonbury and glade tom real ipcress and ben coda all focus their energies on late-night mind-bending techno and their first ep from ben coda and ipcress does the same s opening few bars show the way for the rest of the ep with muscular snare and kick percussive hits and a lumbering growling bassline: an instant wake-up call employing a strict upward curve for the arrangement adding snippets of vocal reverb-laden atmospherics and whirring notes to climb towards the breakdown dropping into a swirl of bit-crushed stabs and pitch-shifted notes until the drop (it makes up in raw punch what it lacks in subtlety ) s aims match its a-side partner though its construction is more nuanced a rumbling sub and wobbling bassline usher in brash leads competing for the mid-range this is no stop-off for the house music classicist but its hard not to imagine this pouring out of towering stacks over a swaying mass of sweaty bodies in a far-flung field that surely is exactly the point
there are a few different sides to lorenz brunner the building blocks stay the same but the way he puts them together changes the on acid test makes mournful techno in the vein of plastikman while on life and death innervisions and hotflush is responsible for the emotional bangers that made his name on ghostly brunner has produced his most ambient and introspective work hinterland inspired by the lush woods surrounding berlin he returns to ghostly and that idea for an ep of twilit techno made with field recordings and hushed arrangements brunner has become remarkably prolific since his rise to fame and the steady rate has led to some diminishing returns isnt an immediate departure but it should soothe fans worried that brunner was losing air from his tires the ep has two of his most striking and delicate tracks in recent memory somber like an old dial record barely rises above a murmur kissed with the now-signature chime melodies though it touches on sounds used in anthems like caldera the title track skirts pastiche through its noir-ish mood slow build and creepy samples of squawking crows on the other hand feels generic built on the thudding basslines and eerie synths popularized by tale of us is like brunners take on shackleton: wobbly and meandering but the chintzy pads try too hard to sound spooky even on a departure like the ingredients are still standard only ricardo s stunning beatless rework of offers anything surprising
the next limited edition release on the wallop imprint comes from disciples of sound kid lopez it s a promising duo of uk music talents and they do a pretty good job in delivering the original mix is first up and i must say this is quite a nice piece of music very chunky from the word go with a deep rolling baseline the track also flows nicely due to a vocal wail that continues throughout most of the track nice and subtly in the background very nice stuff here on the a-side turn it over and you have the distance remix which for me doesn t have the seductive appeal of the original it s a little more industrious with more gritty sounds and cluttered beats it is not a bad piece of music by any stretch but for me it lacks the smooth and sexy nature of the a-side a nice release here from the limited imprint and it s the a-side for me that you should look out for
digital withcraft return to the forefront with a digital release in a track that has seen heavy support from the way out west duo of nick warren and jody the track is a classic digital withcraft production with smooth crisp flowing beats and a great aura to it thanks to some smooth melodic piano lines a deep and smooth rolling baseline and not to mention the great amount of sounds and atmosphere created throughout the track a solid production yet again from this outfit and its well worth a good look
with his last record (junes ascension ) ian odonovan re-iterated his fondness for the middle ground between techno and prog in contrast the irishmans new alias shows off a hitherto unheard side: electro like most of his output it proves a blindingly bright take on the genre most appropriately the title track seems the perfect soundtrack for discovering the mythical city of its glittering pads and almost-squealing arps sound otherworldly but theyre tempered by a husky low-end growl like submarine engines at work as usual odonovans skill at interlocking these elements means his taste for maximalism doesnt ruin the day is similar but takes a more haunting approach its synths are shrill and a little abrasive often racing up the scales unexpectedly the records sole remix is courtesy of dexter one of hollands better-known electro producers doing away with the original growling bass of he builds his version around a tenser and perhaps more striking twang it dominates most of the duration with odonovans brilliant melodies only illuminating the canvas at lengthy and judicious intervals this restraint proves a nice counterpoint to the all-out approach found elsewhere on the record
trained as a jazz drummer but lately hes found common ground with electronic musicians last years densely textured range of regularity dove headfirst into the studio and the ensuing remixes have come from the crew around ricardo (rohrers mbiq trio sometimes collaborates with the minimalist) on the first remix 12-inch he appeared twice solo and together with max loderbauer as vilod on this one he reworks which already suggested his influence in its original form the version finds a balance between brain-tickling detail and the macro-clarity that rohrers work has sometimes lacked the drums are restless and serpentine and vibraphone-ish chords pool darkly in the lower midrange not much happens but it could happily keep happening for another 20 minutes urnt finds more tension in the same track the ideas familiar from his recent outpouring of music are close in spirit to rohrers own coustic-sounding percussion forms a loose polyrhythmic groove while sharp synth zaps and swoops provide contrast the whole thing periodically slots into groovy unity before splintering apart again s with s rework this seven-minute track feels like a snapshot of something much longer when a modal lead-line noodles into view in the closing minute could just be warming up
s has all of the brooding intensity and grit from his tougher outings but also contains uncommon warmth as well following in the same vein his previous releases on like night jewel stotts two-tracker flutters between warehouse techno and luxurious slumbering house evoking memories of long humid summer time nights opens the ep with a deft and luscious padded kick drum and shuffling snares akin to a moody teched-out theo parrish production the track is drenched in atmospheric chords which throb and drone adding to the sultry mood of the track its stott at his most delicate effortlessly balancing the grimy influence of dub and basic channel with groovy crescendo keys that sound like empty milk bottles being rattled stott continues his longtime flirtation with low-end bass and diverse percussion on as it meanders along in the same rugged vein as its predecessor these keys intimate that this track has a more serious and ominous intent something confirmed by stotts trademark metallic drums that chug along with intensity rasping snares intricate cymbals and brooding vocals are the further ingredients they add up to a result that is both warm and atmospheric and complete yet another successful stott ep for one of manchesters finest labels
first album the electro-dubtronica record neurofibro came out four years ago since then mark stewart has relocated from ai records to the deeper trenches of manchester s which last year put out his much drooled over warehouse sessions series pounding floor-friendly and sharply produced that series of four 12-inches delved into the darker sides of techno and electro but is something different again where the warehouse sessions were functional is emotional although in typical style it is an album distilled from an extensive array of influences electro idm detroit techno berlin dub techno outside club forays stewart tends to hang his productions on obscure references such as names of philosophers diseases and personal events in his life and is no exception last track is even a paean on the death of his grandmother like neurofibro the entire album has an odd atmosphere of disease/atrophy that makes it a fairly melancholy affair can be divided neatly into two halves so distinct they could be separate mini-albums first four tracks are melodic warm and driven by heavy beats that dip into the electro-techno crossover stewart s known for all wistful chord progressions and padded bass of these tracks is good while the others are just average second half seems like the real album to the immediately sets a different tone swelling around a deep dubby low end that has really pushed over the last year carries quick percussive triplets over deep swelling bass and blue chord washes while also pulses with low-end propulsiveness and gaseous hisses that are so present in the label s sound it s the standout track of the second half and as such has already had a limited single side release on vinyl arcs through stewart s past accomplishments distilling bits and pieces into a short collection at forty minutes it s certainly concise and after the wheat and chaff part ways what you re left with is rather spare for an album reportedly culled from over a hundred tracks
res a great scene in h os wire that details the wide variety grammatical and contextual of the f-word but id like to propose that the phrase works just as well for instance i used the two words more times than you can imagine when listening to s track of the same name suspicion: when the producer opens up the track with a sample from a porn movie ala kool keith tedium: when i realize that we possibly have more than ten minutes of this to wade through uilding interest: when a yawning string starts to move underneath the proceedings and is joined quickly by deep house synths and a vocal stab incredulity: when various melodic filigree is added on top of all of this increasingly unstable beast and only serves to heighten the tension rather than topple it dmiration: when the track ends and you realize that the deep house revival actually can say something new you almost want to blurt the same with to its credit here goes the vocal route reminding us how easy it is to be ignorant and how easy it is to adjust to the flow implication of course being that is anything but nd judging by how that simplistic house beat is joined up by a traditional tribal fragment and skittering synths im on board with the sentiment late 12-inch of the year contender then
next up on the mighty baroque is a release by irish based producers ridgewalkers feat el and their debut production on the label called alongside the house fuelled original mix is a peak time remix from no other then andy moor the andy moor remix gets the ball rolling and from the word go this release is off the mark in fine form nice crisp beats begin the track shortly before a nice driving baseline gets the track off in the right direction the warm soothing vocals of el soon enter the production accompanied shortly after with some nice melodic tones the track takes a break and then hits peak time mode as all the nice elements of moor s talents unite to create a peak time progressive anthem the original mix follows and it is noticeably more smooth and downtempo then the moor remix soothing house vibes combine delightfully with the seductive vocals of el as the track builds sublimely with very subtle synth stabs that gain in intensity as the track hits the latter stages very smooth and it compliments the remix to create a package with good diversity a pretty strong release for baroque which is almost becoming stock standard behaviour for this solid label
a vinyl-only offshoot of the dutch imprint shipwrec fired out three releases in quick succession after launching late last year its first record of is from the russian artists experimentally-laced techno and ambient sound fits perfectly with the aesthetic made obvious by the labels name here she offers two divergent and compelling productions is a sinister cut for the floor its crisp 4/4 drums are layered with a spiraling acid lead up high and thick bass down low t nearly eight minutes long and with a fairly straightforward drop in the middle its the sort of crafty minimalist track that can be left alone to slowly unfurl or be put to work as a dj tool is a little longer and has rush crafting moody ambient its light rustling percussion adds texture while maintaining rhythmic propulsion cidic synths prickly bleeps and airy pads float through the mix before a final dissolve into (what else ) the heaving spray of the seas
patrice baumel previously released mutant pop on in 2005 since then his style has moved even further from minimalism and towards that of trance there are two very similar sides here: both with bouncing electro basslines nagging melodies and energetic breakdowns each time the track breaks down more layers of melody are added of the two has the better riff and the more original construction however anyone who s spent much time in clubs recently will always know what is about to happen next when listening to either side nd indeed this is my personal problem with nu-trance not very much of it seems nu the marching band melodies and stretched breakdowns will always evoke the podiums lasers and ben sherman shirts of the late nineties for mainstream clubbers this is acceptable if not anthemic fare however for more dedicated sorts it s entirely the wrong side of the cheese line
i missed landing on itunes about 12 hours i was on my way home from work when the stream went live and when i walked in the door i immediately set packing for a trip as my plane landed the next morning my travelling companion asked for my take on the previous nights twitter shits rm and only then did i realize the new album was actually finally an existing piece music not merely a glimmer on the horizon the most elaborate hype campaign in recent memory i was as thrilled hear the album as anyone but i also knew id be late the party: despite the fact that any sane person would have only had the chance listen through three or four times opinions had already hardened and what was immediately apparent when i finally pressed play on was that thomas bangalter and guy-manuel de homem-chris hadnt created something you could reasonably wrap your head around in high speed 21st-century time weve seen a handful artists tinkering with what constitutes a pop record this year: it can apparently have 20-minute ambient doomscapes ( knifes shaking habitual ) and outr -bass freakouts (james blakes overgrown ) and it can even vehemently object the whole idea pop without really disowning it (a m tms hd ) feels pr oundly conservative comparison which in a way makes it just as radical s an album rooted in a now-ancient aesthetic: 70s staples like crisply recorded california studio music or the kind deceptively sophisticated new york disco that rogers one the albums key guest artists popularized with chic nothing here is ironic or hypnogogic or even particularly reverent are just working in a way that practically no one is able or willing end product requires that we put warp-speed aside plug in as massive a pair speakers as possible and just let this thing wash over you youll be thrilled that you did because once unravels it is at its best pretty magnificent those swirling hilariously heavy guitar stabs that send you cringing on the first listen or two y sound wonderfully epic listen five unsettlingly smooth s t-rock ballad that follows youll be diving quite willingly in its painstakingly constructed stereo embrace within a day rambling on about his salad days well you may find yourself skipping past that after a few listens but the loping power- alo instrumental that jumps f around the two-minute mark takes its place amongst s most gratifying tunes unfathomably pleasurable single aside theres really only one cut on the album that hits you immediately doin with belting out the records most memorable melody a mile fittingly its brittle arrangement grows stronger and deeper with each rotation attention youre paying the good also uncovers the albums imperfections as strong as it is the gargantuan by wanders and could have used some editing all rimshots and twinkling rhodes and lamenting melody might be a little more yacht-ballad than you can s mach and i havent yet made up my mind whether is pure filler or a brilliantly conceived collage incidental music from the erotic vampire film aly failed produce either way there should be no pressure choose a side just yet s classics homework and discovery have both stayed with us for over a decade s still way o early say but i wouldnt be surprised if were still teasing out pleasures years down the line
the reissue virus has never been as strong as now a time when there is a distinct feeling among many that its all been done before (and better ) further supporting arguments come every single day and new yorks once again comes correct with a reissue of madhouses stratosphere ep from 199 a collection of raw and deep house tracks from kerri chandler the jersey boy was remarkably prolific during that decade and plenty of tracks have fallen through the cracks as a result it seems strange though that such vital-sounding tunes would have a problem getting pulled out every few years to rapturous response by history conscious djs my best guess as to why falls down to how poorly recorded it all sounds three of the four tracks sound like the kick is overdriven to almost comic effect its a shame because hiding behind the kick is sublime musicianship: moody organ swells jaunty piano ecstatic horns on the one where its a tad cleaner you hear exactly what youre missing: a sublime lesson in how to make deep house that both punches and caresses frequent chandler collaborator yahya mcdougald was in on the sessions for this one but its only chandler that you hear especially in the priceless intros one of which cautions pregnant ladies to stay away from the bass cabinet its a fair warning: after hearing stratosphere again (or for the first time) you may want to hump one
is a new project from matt didemus (one half of junior boys and a solo artist as diva) and his fellow canadian artist adam iron galaxy hodgins didemus founded obsession the label releasing last year and both didemus and hodgins appeared on the compilation ep that launched the label as with didemuss solo work theres no trace of junior boys soft-focus electro-pop here but does evoke his tough diva tracks it begins with a fearsome kick drum which is leavened by a steady intoxicating groove and a melody thats at once pretty and sharp it pulls off the same trick of making competing elements work together that didemus showed on his much-loved diva track paris stabbing on the flip has more of hodgins ear for shining ambience its blinking keys and warm bass feeling like a lullaby after the caffeinated opener whether the project follows one of these directions or remains as varied as the results should be worth hearing
when c copies of the latest - full-length arrived at hard wax recently the rlin institution famous for their quirky record descriptions appeared to be stopped dead in its tracks product page featured no big room advisory or don alert or even a t p y went with just one word: hard wax doesnt exactly do hard-hitting criticism but their brevity here raises an interesting point how much is there left to say about alex o smith etroit producer has remained enviably consistent since his debut ten years ago: his style has been more or less unwavering and with the exception of a lone 12-inch for o parrishs sound signature in 2009 every single one of his slamming analog club tunes has come out through his own fxhe res certainly variety in -ss oeuvre (and a lot to be admired about his thoroughly y operation) but there arent really surprises or moments of reinvention you wouldnt mistake his music or aesthetic for anyone elses but house pretty much covers it where the title of his last album t can one but only can o t conveys the extent to which he owns what he does the title of his latest you for suggests hes not likely to budge from it that pretty much plays out across the album you is stuffed with some very high-quality house music but its not the sort of statement dance artists often make when they tackle the format ts just more - than we typically get at any given moment and all of it falls within his back catalogs standard deviation in terms of quality youll find some extremely good tracks on here like the hard-edged (mixed by luke hess) and the gleefully lo-fi you may also find yourself skipping through a few less-than-considered moments notably these come when smith lets collaborators enter the fray on his singer-on-call lrenees well-performed vocals sound awkwardly naked in the mix leaving you relieved once the brittle machines take over fully taylers piano jamming on though perfectly competent feels a little slapdash wanted this to be a good listening album from beginning to end which it is btw smith told juno plus earlier this year when you was first announced and with a few surprisingly slick transitions and faux-tough guy sketches thrown in you can see what he had in mind still d contest this statement: it clocks in at well over an hour and though it more or less covers his stylistic range all the scratchy drums and dusty keys start to bleed together about halfway through - has produced some genuinely club-transcending tracks psychotic photosynthesis and heres your trance now ance chief among them but even his best moments here arent likely to blow minds outside of a j set so at the end of the day you for is just house albeit a bounty that only this guy could deliver
as well as offering up the aged but still strong - back catalogue to new ears this remix ep also highlights a new wave of spanish producers all three of those chosen have operated on established labels like suara music diynamic and liebe*detail in the past but these will surely be their most popular works to date if only for the subject matter in question coyu steps up with the first re-rub his take on press firms out the originals wobbly bottom into a much flatter tech house beat the vocal weaves in and out sans much editing but the constant bass kills and ensuing techy drops are restless to say the least its thumping main room fodder that ably updates the version first laid down in 92 tackling must have been a daunting prospect for edu its known and loved the world over even outside of dance music relying on s lethargic vocal for the main hook some bulbous sythns end-of-the-night keys and cantering bass notes are sympathetic enough to not to offend but fail to really take on a meaning of their own meanwhile was a broody sample-rich slice of house remixed on release by carl craig into something even broodier uner though takes it in the other direction favouring a bold electro bassline someone like maceo plex may drop in one of his more energetic sets: its probably the best of the lot
in january of this year dario and mario zenker delivered what was in this reviewers opinion one of the best ra podcasts in some time brothers from munich have been at it for nearly a decade but really hit their stride in the past couple of years as their sound veered more toward techno less vakant and more frozen border (a label dario has appeared on under the name 4 26 ) ir podcast suggested the best was still to come it was a live set that showcased reams of excellent upcoming productions their latest ep on brings together four of those tracks sound best when they go off-piste a bit the most traditional song here is an effective bit of atmospheric club techno but somehow it feels a little stuffy has more character thanks to a stepping rhythm and a twisted pair of chords that wind in near the end both tracks on the b-side use a subaquatic palette but to different ends: is a gently euphoric percussive workout while is halfway between a club track and an ambient sketch like something from john beltrans ten days of blue se two are the most identifiably and theyre all the better for it
a1 small town boy b1 the decision does anyone still remember the 1980 s i actually don t remember too much pop culture (except from what i catch in i love the 80 s on the tele and of course the cartoons of the time) but if you were a heavy clubber back in the day o r n s (16b) new single should bring back fond memories of days gone by first off let me just ask this; what s the fascination with the 1980 s the 80 s happened 20 years ago time has changed and so has the culture no more big hair heavy make-up and neon style clothing now it s sleek du s natural style make-up and little or no clothing so why do people still try to keep the 80 s alive through music and movies what is the fascination they have with this era do they just want to relive their youth or do they just want to forget about the present i m only asking because 16b has taken an 80 s song and rerubbed it into an electro house that feels like something from the 1980s so after all the hype all the talk and all the wait small town boy finally sees a full release for the first 5 minutes i d swear this was just a pop record and it is taking the vocals from bronski beat in the 80 s this catchy and enriching little joint screams of cheerful grooves the smooth 4/4 beat intro for the vocals works well as it creates a lush retro feel with the uplifting piano keys and vibrant vocal that creeps through for the first half of the track 16b makes you want to sing along with him as the bassline continues the groove keeping it happy the drum patterns reach out whenever the vocals are away certainly a summer style song for the masses but for a track that s a bit over 7 minutes that focuses on the first 4 minutes layering it with vocals and leaving the rest of the track as an instrumental doesn t balance out correctly leaving the final few minutes a bit lacking in the production and because of the disproportion you ll lack interest with the second half of the song i want to hear this on the radio as this cries for a radio edit because this would be a great radio-friendly pop choon a double take with the instrumental mix as this is not a re-release but the actual release that first saw the light of day prior as a one-sided mix simply known as the decision when the samples where in limbo the instrumental is still a massive dance floor killer with it s subtitle differences between the vocal mix the break points are more noticeable and you can hear more attention to detail on subtle sounds bangin drum patterns certainly doesn t hurt as it peaks in and out with an awesome riff the booty shaking percussion adds a smile to your face that s just right for the girls to let loose i ll admit it s a bit cheeky at times and even now some might think it s a bit cheesy but who cares because we all just wanna have fun don t we so was it worth clearing the samples i think so the vocal mix will grab attention to a wider audience and the instrumental is still as powerful on the dance floor the 80 s are still alive and kickin it downside the clubs courtesy of 16b label: www sexonwax com site: www omid16b com
was set up two years ago as a platform for music by parisian artists like and manar se acts had nothing to do with the classy techno or dignified deep house you might associate with the capitals bustling scene stead theirs is a tough take on jacking house inspired by bass music and delivered with a distinctly attitude label stakes its claim to the city of light with paris club music offering up two discs of music every bit as gruff and glamourous as the capital itself paris club music volume 1 is split between new material and the best of the labels initial run highlights disc opens with the two tracks that started it all still among the best of its catalogue and are halfway between dance mania and trax with hard snapping snares and formidable low end sprinkle in the repetitive tics and flamboyant vocal samples of ballroom ( i can give you money for my champagne bitch ) and youve got yourself a winning formula not everyone is as confrontational as mr ; s irrepressible dresses up the lfo blasts in sampled strings and mismatched diva samples while s g is basically a fat bottomed pop song s from that best typifies the the collectives sound with its pitched down vocals dulcet repetition and generally delirious mood by comparison the new material hits with militaristic force disc begins with a mix of the crews biggest hit yet the ballroom pastiche of which strips the already bare track to the white of its bones s makes commands like rub on my tits and squeeze on my ass sound apocalyptic with percussion so inflated with reverb that every cowbell feels like a death knell even manar s the most straightforward tune here is stripped down to razor thin dimensions so its more cutting than slamming s excellent u throws grime into the equation with honking horn stabs se paris scenesters dont live in a vacuum from salva to dirtybird to hessle audio there are plenty of other artists striking a similar chord but theres something about the way that they work in ideas from ballroom miami bass and ghetto tech that feels different grey and ominous like techno slinky like house and volatile like modern bass music whether or not you consider it the sound of paris its an aesthetic thats all their own

is not former u s president lyndon b johnson after all but rather lazy bones jones a k a jonas verwiinen who according to press release is finland s number one export judging from this the label s 25th vinyl release that s about as flattering a tag as borat s for his sister: she is number four prostitute in whole of kazakhstan it s a double a-side affair and first up is harmaa which starts off in the dregs with a casio keyboard breakbeat if there ever was one things do get better as it goes along however first with a marginally better growling bassline and eventually some rolling guitar loops it s at this point when harmaa nails its head on the low doorway of mediocrity and crumbles back to its roots: the guitars get pitch-shifted into a noisy siren-y neverending breakdown that draws up a mental picture of the track actually on its hands and knees begging you to turn it off on the non-flipside aa saqawu at least has a slighty more fun title it kind of sounds like a summer camp this time the track s appetizer is a robotic countdown from 8 to 0 which inexplicably gets repeated about a minute later until dives into another cesspool of pitched-out guitar samples mercifully the drop isn t as bad as on harmaa ; instead it s some unthreatening computer drums and unremarkable bass to summarize both tracks on s harmaa / saqawu ep are like watching a train made of lego slowly build up in stop-motion but that s almost too flattering a comparison because it sounds gondry-esque how about watching a computer program make its own breaks s double dose has about that much soul the most instantly disposable breaks tracks of

*back catalog review* the first release on comes from and 2 very unique tracks to get this great label rolling on the a-side is seminal vessel it begins with a solid kick and some rattling hats and snares the track builds with a nice deep baseline and a smooth soundscape of sweeping sound effects and cute intricate melody deep into the track a hypnotic layer of strings give the production that extra edge a great production on the flip is firstly 2600 a d a deeper production this track beigns with a standard 4/4 drum pattern followed by some smooth vocal and sound effects deep into the track the effects gain intensity and begin to become more erratic in a pleasing way following is controlled input a quirky production due to some unique drum patterns and eerie effects a subtle bouncy baseline gives the production a good drive but it is the use of unique sounds and swirling effects that are a highlight of this track
the response to s early eps and debut album would suggest this release which sees danny and perc rework two great examples of the london producers sound wont be the last remix package we see of his recent work s take on mid-album highlight is a lower-key proposition than the vivid multi-directional original with a fragment of the tracks get into the state vocal motif looped and repurposed as a surrogate hi-hat intro the addition of scurrying hats varying synth digressions and more loops from the whispered vocal makes for a subtle and interesting rework but it never excites quite as much as the original on the flip londons perc turns in a remix of n industrial techno pounder from the get-go it kicks off with a gleaming mechanical riff and a snarled vocal snippet that could have been sampled from a black metal track sudden switch takes the originals lolloping synth chords and clads them in steel before that early riff and vocal part return its simple compelling and definitely not for the faint-hearted
troy pierce is a strange cove hes got to be one of the most uncompromising djs around and has scant regard for his audience unless theyre willing to embrace his own particular brand of hell on earth hes a member of the minus crew but seems to have little in common with them relatively speaking if theres anyone whos usurped the minimal aesthetic and customised it in only the best gothic black then troys the one i often wonder how his stuff goes down in places where the sun shines all day at any beach party for instance troy is championed as minimals secret weapon but in reality hes spawned a genre of his own one thats in touch with the dark side in all of us which were reluctant to completely surrender to his productions sound like no one else and in the process hes become one of the genres few real auteurs of any note on record he has few peers so i cant imagine that its an easy job to remix him s the first to try on this ep the second batch of remixes of cuts from pierces enemy love album as her interpretation of meanders and undulates like a motorbike thats dying a slow death but its got the funk courtesy of a throbbing bassline that drags the track through a low key angst spoken word vocal s take on is nothing special but it does the job keeping things nagging and insistent with a high end percussive battery interspersed with thick slabs of bass s remix of is like a narcoleptic trying to wake up: its an exercise in futility that just never seems to get off the ground properly finally d offer something a little different with a piece of subdued drama that races across the steppes into oblivion sporadically broken up by what sounds like a synthesised harpsichord its a linear piece on an infinite loop and its not easy to imagine where its taking you and d come off best here but its my feeling that a little bit too much respect has been paid to the originals overall whether theyve been tampered with enough or not each track with the exception of sounds to my ears like troy is still at the controls res an overriding sense of melancholia and loss that unites each interpretation which is perfectly in keeping with the originals not an easy artist to remix at all then but its an indication of his strength as an producer that he brings everyone around to his way of thinking so effortlessly
hes been playing making and releasing records since around 1990 but this is actually traum boss reinholds first full solo release no time like the present etc etc is a very simple but quite beautiful record made up of less sounds than the average coldcut drum loop but its beautifully executed the crawling kick dubby bassline and linear structure hint at asic channel but the warmth and colour that define the track are definitely cologne eno-esque ambient washes and gently pulsing chords and synths ebb and flow throughout the seven-minutes resulting in an addictive hypnotic experience thatll leave you in a zen-like state unfortunately the b-side is a bit of a non-event - a murky tool of alien transmissions that does little for eight minutes
really is one of the most genre-defying labels around just look at its roster apart from the huge constrasts from artist-to-artist nearly all its signings are possessed with a certain creative restlessness take shed cosmin trg or addison groove; all have proven incredibly hard to put in boxes the latest addition to this camp is a french producer whose debut album is set to drop on the label before the end of the year if is anything to judge by its going to be a diverse bunch of tracks on the a-side doles out cascading synth lines onto unsteady beats well thats one thing it does anyway were it not for the hard-shelled percussion constantly booming and hissing at its core disjointed might have been an appropriate descriptor raising the stakes with a stuttering vocal is just as twitchy recent years have spoiled us with regard to vocal treatments which is perhaps why this one seems a tad plain and yet the tracks halting light-footed groove proves surprisingly infectious up last seems like the most obvious choice for dance floors here a simpler and meatier breakbeat acts as the vehicle for a nauseating quasi-acid loop to unravel this last effort shows a producer as comfortable with functionality as he is with going off-road
silent servant is often under-credited name when it comes to regiss label the los angeles-based producer not only manned ir do series which has featured s debut ep tropic of cancer and o rs he also runs america duo of taylor burch and joe cocherell are also from la no doubt three of m are part of same post-industrial/ scene re drum machines aside early songs had a distinctly goth sound largely due to lots of reverb-soaked guitar licks but last years wet vision ep saw m turn towards a more electronic dance floor sound and is logical conclusion the title track starts with a 4/4 kick and judicious use of guitar for rough punctuation is perfect accompaniment for burchs dissolute vocals the whole thing is sexy as hell and takes a cue from regiss own rolling-thunder techno is followed by slowed down breathy dub ano r version n the uses some of originals vocal and guitar samples but adds a new vocal lead for a rough military stomper add to that a radio edit of title track and youve got a set of related but different tracks that up ante for what a single can be

the first release on (formally known as vudu recordings) comes from in the form of and two remixes that give the vocal hit a different vibe each italian producer mulu under the guise of massive lust gives his reworking on the a-side and he turns in a retro house anthem the track starts off quite dark and techy in the first few moments before the vocal kicks in as well as the uplifting vibes not before long the epic strings soon take control while the vocal helps the epic vibe on its way and it really is a peak time house number for the most part on the flip d ramirez delivers the better remix turning this track into something a little more special smooth flowing strings begin the track as the drums build in a nice and quirky way the vocals feel more at home in this remix as they echo their way through the track quirk synths weave their way into the track midway but it is the fusion of al the elements that make this track stand out a quality reworking from a quality producer a pretty good release by that sees 2 contrasting remixes the massive lust remix will surely be more viable for the commercial sound while the d ramirez remix really gives the production a great edge
the third release from the people that bring you londons society of the underbelly parties sees its sibling promoters my and tim take advantage of their italian connections by asking neapolitan trio to reveal their talents s original mix of is barreling grinding house that reverberates to a metallic clank and the thump of a tom-tom that sounds like its being retuned mid-hit in lex rnouts soft hands it winds its neck in a tad the dogmatik label head putting his faith in a gem of a bassline that snakes the length of this organic tech house cut fans of something deeper can get their fix from matt and s outing less bubbling more lightly sparkling its wobbling keys sound like electronic steel drums coupled with verdant chicago-style synth stabs and a frothy itchy rhythm it completes an ep of adroitly constructed beautifully balanced dance music
kevin martins project is as distinguishable as it is versatile over the last 15 years hes teamed with idiosyncratic vocalists from the realms of dancehall dub and grime from the spoken-word coos of colliston white to the defining dread of flowdan and it usually works as martin is an intuitive engineer whos sensitive to the personalities of his collaborators he also has a clear vision for the music which lends an inherent sense of duality that calcified on angles evils on that record groupers liz harris and irate eath grips vocalist mc ride represented the two extremes of martins collaborations with / s latest p that gap is significantly narrower stylistically ouble s serrated chattering on is like bubbling lava to ans menacing ice-cool delivery on the flip the a-sides horns and crystalline snares do the leg work around the vocals while martins production on is a weighty soundsystem detonator of the highest order both tracks convey the foreboding energy that has become s calling card carefully tweaked to suit each mcs needs
a track like which just builds and builds and builds until it cant build anymore deserves something like which is effectively three minutes of prologue s skill here impresses prelude is a peerless set opener that leads directly into but its more interesting to listen to for its remarkable sound design its clear that tur has aspirations beyond the dance floor and it quickly becomes apparent that he likely has the ability to do much more than weve been led to believe potential aside and both serve as reminders that turs artistic bent rarely gets in the way of making people move each tune seems to consciously take from the same set of sounds making for a remarkably cohesive package as we mentioned simply increases the pressure for six-and-a-half minutes until its nigh-on unbearable and tur somehow scales things back effortlessly meanwhile luxriuates in a riff that is at once vicious and calmly enveloping that it can be both at the same time is the power of dub ut its also the talent of tur who has quietly amassed one of the most impressive discographies of the past few years i for one cant wait to see where he goes from here
for some time now ristol has been a torchbearer for the deeper more cultured side of uk bass music with a gaggle of top-notch labels tectonic punch drunk pple pips and immerse primarily spewing out quality releases with alarming regularity which runs out of the towns much-loved rooted records looks to be no exception having already graced us with two excellent 12-inches and now this: young joe cowtons second release under his moniker and most likely the darkest slab of slow house-meets-ukg youll hear all year -side sounds like something the pink panther would come up with after a heavy night out with the workshop crew its plodding bass and slinky hats establishing a suavely sinister groove chugging away at a sleazy 115 pm a muffled 4/4 kick submerged deep in the mix keeps it all locked together while a chirpy chipmunky female vocal evokes garages champagne-swilling glory days (albeit minus the champagne and the glory) -side plunges fathoms deeper losing a couple of pm and ramping up the bass which aside from clickety hats and sparse menacing fx is all the track really consists of its amazing what 2-step sounds like at this tempo tense sweaty claustrophobic and that it works so well is just reward for s dark daring approach

to fanboys of a certain persuasion the idea of stablo and rekids bosses launching a joint label especially one named after the diner from david lynchs twin peaks is enough to induce palpitations s curators jamie fry and matt radio slave edwards both have strong credentials both run labels centred on rhythm and groove the kind of records that never leave the bag s first release (named after the owner of the uble r diner) outlines the labels intentions to expose fresh modern music that [stands] on its own twin peaks motif seems to leak onto s whose disembodied wails bubble up through waterlogged chords like the last gasps of someone drowning percussion in contrast is sharp whip of a junglists snare plays lightly against an offbeat shuffle giving an otherwise lumbering beat a more dynamic lurch feels more like a rekids release t has a bassline skipping lightly below pads that swirl through static and reverberant drums t leans a little heavily on texture over substance but stands up on a solid start to a very promising label
listening to records by juju jordash the term dance music doesnt really spring to mind tempo might fit the mold (if a little slow) but the beat itself is too simple and utilitarian as if its only purpose is to lend structure to the jazzy free-form shapes that swirl around it this was particularly true on their self-titled full-length from last year and only a bit less so on tattoos their first 12-inch on an imprint that often supports such meanderings tattoos is light on funk and heavy on abstract imagery a psychedelic mess of sound anchored by a 4/4 pulse ep presents three different versions of tattoos : two by the duo themselves and one remix by dutch artist tom trago two j j mixes are similar: plodding rhythms soaring keys and looping bass melodies are all treated with lots of reverb and delay both sport a clear krautrock influence helped in no small part by guitar leads that seem to melt beneath the whammy bar his remix tom trago tries to whip things into shape doing away with most of the trippy stuff to make room for a punchy beat and catchy synth line its a nice track and one thats much easier for djs to kick around but it lacks the vivid quality of its counterparts like so much of juju jordashs music tattoos favors weird charisma over funkiness and that only makes it more worthwhile

with has proven herself to be a rare a r talent each of the labels weighty double packs finds a coherent statement in a jumble of tracks old and new in spite of signing the odd megahit ( s i wanna go bang ) seems more interested in seeing out her vision than making accessible functional techno releases (why else the rambling concepts involving hollywood actors ) the labels latest takes this bloody mindedness one step further it features what might be s biggest coup yet the first release of an track that popped up in last years soundcloud dump is a weird one its strings ugly and dissonant its kicks thundering along above 140 b m follows the cue favouring tracks that explore similar high tempos and melodramatic moods they might be a hard sell on many dance floors but they make for an engaging and unusual e and opulation each provide a remorseless techno rager the formers has a quaint prog edge that somehow makes it all the harder; the latters is two decades older (the third track by the 90s outfit to appear on ) but more than holds its own elsewhere the mood is tense and unstable a second track opens the e with breakbeats and the distant threat of a reese bassline another icelander the late creates swirling fractal beat patterns on an untitled track dredged from his archives by russian duo tu is uk garage with the bones picked clean nervous and angular the odd one out is s own track dont its got the speed she runs her volca drum machine ragged through a distortion unit but the mood is lightened by synth chords that wander across the keyboard with a nonchalance suggested in the title is it playable robably not and thats part of its appeal

remix has always been an interesting concept even if its no longer a novel one sometimes though its nice when artists re-imagine their own work rather than someone elses its like getting to read both endings in a choose your own adventure book in this case its la resident debuting on with four new tracks including two versions of in the original an unobtrusive hi-hat and fat kick march alongside one another leading the procession coupled with a jaunty bassline and airy pads the overall effect is carefree without feeling overdone less mix does as expected stripping back the bass and pads to create a more serious club affair both are nice but probably destined to be filler material for lack of memorability rather than quality other two cuts fare better in this sense firmly establishes the summery mood that the original only hinted at with vast windy gusts of synth and calm bass plucks on the other hand is memorable if only for being a strange collage of sounds quasi-latino percs meet psychedelic growls 8-bit-like bleeps and later on deep thudding bass it almost sounds like two tracks smooshed together perhaps bickle isnt content with reading just the one ending
with his debut album under the moniker dave huismans produced one of the most stylistically perfect dubstep full-lengths to date fusing his unique sense of swung dance floor rhythms with the stark stabs of synthesizer that techno pioneers basic channel made prudent erial was as the bleak artwork reinforced an impeccable exploration of the shadows of greyscale the follow-up is even better seeing him discovering colour embracing the lighter scales and sometimes even twinkling with melody from the get-go with just a distant flicker of a high pitch behind the most forcefully danceable opening drum break youre ever likely to hear marks huismans defiant statement where erial spliced the bass weight of dubstep with the driving minimal drum work of techno explores the new multi-limbed bastardization of bass music in full by pooling an array of lighter sounds and synth tones and layering them over warm bass tones rather than the dour stabs of low end that littered his debut a does this perfectly wrapping elementally calming bass notes around a simple staccato beat and tumbling melody is the opposite with galloping kick drums and a garage snare pattern taking the flux away from the overrun lounge pianos that swirl up through the octaves everything from the ascending bass notes of to the hesitant hum of the synthesizer on the title track point toward the fact that huismans is now texturing all of his productions differently these 11 tracks are happier than any previous work to date and they make huismans as a producer categorically shimmer despite the minor keys on and re fooling his unfathomable talent for drum programming and surmising a groove in an 8-bar loop pushes past the subtly delayed nuances and snatches of melody and headlong into the pulses of low end and this new arsenal of technicolour fizzing synthesizers feels a bit like a zenith for techno-tinged dubstep in there hasnt been an album that sums up the attitude and style of a producer so well since martyns great lengths and its plush decadence similar to that record these tracks work just as well away from the dance floor just as comfortably soundtracking that last slow tussle with consciousness as they do your 4 m drunken peak
matrixxman (aka charles duff) and echologist (aka brendon moeller) have a fair amount in common as two categorical shapeshifters and electro might have defined duffs debut album homesick but house and hip-hop are just as important to him moeller has also moved through dance music freely but his echologist project stays deep and dubby suffice it to say that the producers collaborative ep for dutch label planet rhythm is stylistically nuanced the black white ep doesnt sound monochromatic so much as richly greyscale could be a lost homesick dub sharing in that records desolate futuristic sound is a deep acid cut that contains its 303 angst in one of moellers silky cocoons immediately kicks into peak-time mode but the ambient synths that swoosh in effectively erode its stony facade and are the most streamlined collaborations standing out for their slick functionality is the eps most curious inclusion with a polluted claustrophobic atmosphere its rumbling bass explodes in the distance muted to add some ghostly presence to the tracks sense of dread
next up on eq greys offshoot label is an ep from nicolas vall e this french dj producer already has many strings to his bow having released some serious electronic music under the guise of aphrodogz and silvertone the keeps in the house mould with a very tasty three tracker first off the plate is original mix of incitement and immediately were left in no doubt about this eps credentials as an incredibly rich blend of filtering chords and slightly reverbd percussion lead into a daft-esque groove made up rolling house beats thats not it as a funked up bassline and guitar riff shimmers in-between a rising mood of satisfaction emanating from the pads underneath consistently re-shaping itself through use of flanging and phasing this all culminates with the mood dissipating before building back up again with the addition of an acidic synthline taking over till its end the late night mix is on the flip and is chocked full of techy style elements that cut their way through a lush mix of stabbing strings and filtery motion while the squeaking synthline takes the centre providing the build for an awesome breakdown which flexes a steroidic disco punch by now of your feet havent worn you out theres one more gem to come generation x was featured on desyn masiellos bedrock os_01 mix and sums up the spirit of this ep oozing warmth and feeling through use of emotive melodies sensual vocals and laid back flow lush to say the least with three stand alone tracks to this ep its not just another filtered house record but one that will remain in record boxes for some time its refreshing highly enticing and damn exciting
you might know as mode a drum bass producer whose spacious tracks earned him a spot in the utonomic universe but his other moniker is markedly different sharing the same penchant for catchy melodies but little else is his name for house-ish music that leans towards the melancholic dragging-feet beats drizzled in analogue synth represents the darker end of the spectrum broken beats spilling out from the bars over discombobulating bass stabs and trippy synth work that feels like its curling up the ground from underneath the track slurred speech snippets add to the disorientation is decidedly less droopy with its throbbing warehouse beat but the pitched-down wailing diva who switches from commanding the chorus and driving the verses like a bass melody ensures that things never really get anything less than weird the nameless heroine chatters and mumbles like shes speaking in tongues a welcome touch that separates this producer from the other million uk producers moving to house with chopped-and-minced vocal samples
veteran west coast beatmaker brings sunny but sloppy (in a good way) hip-hop beats to manchesters fat city imprint on his ep using a primer of soul-laden strings guitars and vocals dibiase deftly crafts interesting but unstable grooves that threaten to break down every other bar or so the vibes go from laid back funky outings to more aggressive head-nodding vibes and runnin are an example of the former and call for the inevitable but deserved dilla comparisons while and provide a neck bumping soundtrack with their big basslines and hard-hitting rhythms twists and turns in the arrangement add spice and the vocal sample snippets make for the icing on the cake keeping the songs from falling into the stale monotony that often befalls instrumental hip-hop while the sample sources and approach are thoroughly hip-hop there is a touch idm in the way that dibiase presents his basslines and synths with this experimentation falling on the right side of funky though sounds less like a flying delorean from 2015 and more like a convertible ride through sunny california
in enlisting the anonymous duo for their fourth release erlin imprint killekill are fast proving their appetite for eclecticism their previous two releases from lex cortex and ill youngman explored playful house and pounding techno of course given who made this one its all about chicago house and roland drum machines the title track is a pretty convincing slice of old-school acid with prim rimshots and everything else youd expect the initial melody is a kind of shrill bleating which occupies most of the stage until the second half when its joined by a tweaking 303 s time goes on the two writhe against each other sounding more and more tortured the percussion follows this lead building to a clattering peak which seems to be the tracks raison d tre it does well the acid line defeating the bleeps and squelching sedately to the end i hesitate to use such a strong term but the -side is nothing short of annoying gain roland samples make up the basics but this time the melody is a short vocal loop half yelled half not the indistinct snippet begins with an open-mouthed syllable perhaps just the word i which imparts a harsh barking quality throughout most of the song the middle offers respite with a wobbly coltish synth taking over its short-lived however with the vocal returning and bringing cascades of cymbals with it
is one of those drum bass producers whose tracks are so minutely and compulsively precise that they sometimes feel unapproachably cold he usually escapes this potential problem by virtue of his taste for cavernous dub atmospherics and steadily capsizing basslines and his debut for fledgling drum bass label ingredients is no different start with the b-side which is a tad assertive by recent standards snarling drums step in and out of alternately simplistic and complex patterns suspended above a stomach-churning backdrop of probing bass stabs and manipulated string samples n theres which chugs forward in the same direction as last album ritual dance though its a slightly looser take on the distinctive conveyer-belt-driven progression percussive accents flutter frantically and the melodic elements are refracted into broken beams of light converting the overt dub influences of ritual into steel and glass y the time the sloping bassline drills its way into the song its an anthem in disguise rolling unassumingly on cruise control and annihilating everything in its path on paper is your typical track with all the familiar elements in place in execution however its a slab of carefully refined drum bass from a junglist legend
terence fixmer and nitzer ebbs douglas mccarthy make an impressive team the revival of their studio collaboration last year was full of vitriol the vocal version of so many lies was a stomping rally cry for disillusioned people everywhere while the b-side version brought the battle to the dance floor with a surge of boiling techno fixmer and mccarthys new record for is even more unsettling everything about sounds wrong which helps make it right fixmers production feels like a carefully orchestrated racket that grates from the off as if its been designed to rattle you individual noises are discordant and broken as they converge into a throbbing mass resembling an alarm on meltdown meanwhile mccarthy growls like a demon over the top keep dreaming is his final cry a resolution and a meagre dash of hope for others wrestling with the world even fixmers production settles down after that is similarly brash and in your face like any good ebm track should be but this isnt a waltz down memory lane its ebm brought screaming and wailing into present day
has never been predictable shes been a house vocalist a dubstep producer a synth-pop troubadour and a badass sound designer since leaving ninja tune last year and starting records shes been even freer to stretch out and explore now following an excellent -inch of silky electro in december ( melancholia euphoria ) comes an lp of solo piano music well alright then observant listeners will recognize that title from a 20 ep of the same name that one came as a pre-order bonus for s second album dva and comprised three piano instrumentals called d lo the new album gives us d lo s four through recorded at s childhood home in milton keynes on the piano that she grew up with its inspired equally by czech composer leo jan ek and her feelings about returning to the comfort of her family which lends a certain innocence to the compositions a virtuoso shes not but the point isnt to dazzle you with her quick fingers lays bare her icy minor-key sensibility on the ivories and in doing so shows what made tracks like pretend and double edge stand out as she moves from one composition to the next her songs remain engaging even if solo piano experiments arent your thing of course cant leave sounds untouched is peppered with little bits of manipulation sometimes the sounds catch and stutter sometimes the melodies are remolded into shinier synth-like sounds but at its heart is still an album of piano recordings from an artist otherwise associated with dance music and so its destined to be a niche effort for a niche audience still theres something attractively contemplative about it in a 20 feature said being alone at her piano allowed her to tap into a very stable place of solitude within [herself] the kind of thing other people seek in yoga or meditation that feeling of peace solitude and fulfillment is what makes a record worth owning
a lot of people have said a lot of things in regards to james holden s (bc) label some say it s the most forward-thinking label to come out in years within the field of dance music while others believe that this abstract-indie-inawarpkindaway has no place on the dancefloors of the world and they re both right this is music for the home but the dance sensibilities from the remixes have worked quite well with past releases the only question that should remain is if s soopertrack continues the tradition the opening piece for this four-track single starts with soopertrack bass heavy with slight percussions as the bass frequencies interchange from time-to-time the standard of music if it s not deep and heavy then it s not the sound of bc it s a bit surprising that so many producers sound so much like holden these days or is it that holden sounds like so many of the producers that he signs to his label whatever the case may be his sanctuary is providing some much needed sounds to dance to it wouldn t be a bc release without tools for the dj to play with so you ll find the soopertrack tool also on the main-side here you ll hear cleaner bass lines with the drum kick tighten up for good measure like a ping-pong recoiling back and forth the tool works slowly as the building blocks forms its way a five minute piece that at times sounds as though it moves no where but for the dj that s exactly what you need to play without worrying about keys or notes clashing the second original track found is zu fuss a bit madding with its clicks and hollow snares as it s creepy almost as though it s trying to scare you it isn t halloween is it this is not dance music but it s engaging s soundtrack scoring pushes the line where electronic music breaks away from dance music entirely with the mutter mix of zu fuss this dark ambient piece resonates beauty found in darkness ghostly vocals begin clear yet it soon vanishes away and the violins work in great effect giving the remix a somber tone another fine release from as the label continues to establish itself as the alternative to traditional dance music
since day one (or close to it) grime has been dogged with a reputation for being unsafe unstable or inconsistent ccording to critics its been on the cusp of resurfacing for years now on life support waiting for a saviour but in truth theres always been a lot going on you just have to know where to look labels like butterz no hats no hoods have been proving its continued relevance for years s 2 0 reinforces their efforts with one of the biggest outsider jobs in recent memory; compiled by journalist oe muggs it collects over two hours of the best new material grime has to offer but dont be fooled by the title: 2 0 doesnt present a new version of the sound so much as a picture of a scene thats as healthy as its ever been for those whove been away grime has mostly outgrown its obsession with the arid l scapes of eski in fact theres not a whole lot of retro here unless you count the purposefully thin textures of s the dominant sounds on 2 0 are lurid funk synths dubstep basslines the hissing rhythms of hip hop trap the results are mixed; compare s maximalist machismo on nd to miyakes pastiche which lazily cobbles together bl merican rap touchstones despite pervasive nostalgia for the supposedly lost brilliance of grimes early days its sacred cows are still alive kicking offering an hd upgrade on the original sound s twists a wordless vocal sample like ribbon over a headbanging bassline ( pulse x producer hasnt aged as well judging from his amateurish contribution ) the newer torchbearers meanwhile make the case that grimes best moments arent limited to its legends: s demonic horn section still has a death grip on classic grime aesthetics s pumps out synth arpeggios like machine gun fire former bassline head s toned down tuned up shows how pared down takes on the template can still sound fresh though grime is inherently nglish its finally becoming an international phenomenon nycs turns grime cliches into carnival fare with the excellent torontos takes a ersey club influenced stab at rihanna with if you heard either track outside the compilation you might not immediately think of grime the fact that they sit comfortably here proves how far the sound has stretched beyond the purist beginnings that its so often fenced into though its way too long to listen to in one sitting 2 0 is catnip for the grime fan good bait for those new to or curious about the genre s an expansive bravely warts all look at a misunderstood movement still fighting hard for proper recognition over a decade later

maybe not since his thora vukk album has sounded as emotionally expressive as he does on the german house veterans first original record in three years without losing sight of the subtle quirks and full-bodied sounds hes known for wruhme wrings otherworldly pathos ( ) inner joy ( ) and romantic nostalgia ( i and ii ) from his heady mix of electronics and live sampling only two tracks on are meant for dance floors but all four aim to capture the life-affirming moments those places can foster the title track starts in a dark mood wruhme fiddles with its sinister synths and pervasive low-end until about midway through when he wraps things in an astral shimmer the melodic twinkle that tops it all off feels like a surprise ending few couldve come up with the other dj-friendly track is far less coy about its intentions a three-note bass throb lifts the modest tech-house shuffle out from the ether and continues to ebb and flow under frisky incidental sounds for seven-plus minutes while the central theme stays essentially uncluttered throughout momentary flourishes help color the otherwise clear-cut outline it closes on a touching set of piano chords which like the two poignant interludes shows just how much heart wruhme puts into his records
all of s records are variations on a style: raw thumping analog house his best ones though are a perfection of it everything he puts out on (the label he runs with his brother emg) is worth hearing but some of it has been truly exceptional especially 003 007 and the live experience to name a few his latest is and as you can probably tell from the name its more or less what hes always done but hes never done it much better than this and pull together all of swings favorite ingredients: sandy hi-hats white-hot snares warbly disco samples and skipping overdriven kick drums both tracks are bright funky and when that greasy low-end rolls in pretty massive the b-side takes a slightly different tack trades the grainy sound for something more crisp pairing a bouncy garage-style beat with a thick rolling bassline a series of samples float in out of nowhere first a pitched up vocal ( talkin bout your troubles talkin bout your troubles ) and then a smooth ascending synth melody both feel somehow unexpected when they arrive something that could perhaps be chalked up to swings live approach to production a through and through borrows from emgs more sinister sound palette this one offsets a queasy loop of shakers and upright bass with the urgent hi-hats these guys do so well forming a murky and aggressive bit of house noir it keeps pace with the rest of the ep while proving theres more to swing than straight-up party vibes

tim vit oliver gehrmanns take on deep house owes much to the warm organic-sounding approach of uk productions made at the turn of the 21st century heavy on the roland tr-707 and korg synths hammonds and congas the berlin-based duo keep it understated on the wistful a chopped-up vocal sample contributing to the rhythm track alongside latin percussion and a throbbing organ riff there are nods to the classic house tropes of sandy rivera on bursting with 707 cowbells and sun-dappled organs as it heads towards a clattering breakdown the floaty dub which uses a fairly liberal chunk of the s o s bands youre the finest as an anchor wafts around on a cloud of dreamy synths guttural percussion and bubbly hi-hats while theres little new ground broken here its the kind of solid honest house ep that vit and gehrmanns compatriots tiefschwarz would favour

chicago native has released a cd of ambient techno on traum (with andreas bucci) as detalles but this is her first release under her own name a 12 of dancefloor-oriented fare for seattles kupei label a classically trained pianist she has also worked with philip glass appearing on glasscuts: phillip glass remixed unfortunately that was an appalling album even worse than the dreadful steve reich: remixed project released some years earlier with we get two tracks by simko and two remixes of the title track itself is a colourful bubbly number too in thrall with its own insipid melodic patterns (plonked out on preset keyboard tones) to make any progress a bassline to match is repeated unwaveringly theres a bit of the necessary background grit and the drums are serviceable but this sounds like late-nineties cologne minimalism well-meaning but it seems empty today the remix by swedens unai is the highlight here breaking the arpeggios into chunks and punching up the bassline his version kicks and throbs like prime french house simkos original is present as mere echoes and here the synth patterns gurgle from a decaying music box by the time we reach the b-side and jonas berings mix the melodic base of has become truly cloying but kompakts gallic standard bearer pulls things back reducing the tempo to turn out an enjoyable piece of gently-thumping pop ambient again the melody is truncated with bering emphasising just one chord strumming it out on a spanish guitar evoking klimek meeting triola simkos final offering machine war is equally reliant on uninspired repeated tone patterns and overbearing sound patches opening low-slung and plodding like berlin dub things lurch into high gear with gruff electro riffs and bright keys brash unsubtle yet sparse it sits uncomfortably between minimal and jacking electrohouse without being either the accompanying press release stresses simkos knack for crafting classically-inspired harmonic depth into her work but little of that is present here rather we get melodies hacked from sixties minimalism which presented raw like this arent sufficient to anchor these empty tracks itself might satisfy some early-evening electrohouse purveyors but its the remixes that are worth checking here

somas been at the techno vanguard for more than two decades as other equally seminal labels have fallen away failed to evolve or simply struggled to remain viable in a shifting music industry the glaswegian imprint has been a bastion of all thats tough and floor-shaking its fitting that its owners should mark the 400th release with something that epitomises those qualities the ep comes ahead of an album later this year that if this is a taster will be all about glimmering synth lines rolling basslines and precision-programmed percussion presumably takes its name from the arpeggios that flow around each other like watch hands with touches of phasing creating chords from what seem to be single notes it gives an otherwise hypnotic stomper a dizzying edge is simpler it has a looping bell line chattering hats and fittingly for a track named for the study of reflected sounds barely audible fragments that sound like the lead line bouncing back distorted from a distant wall with no sign of dipping quality from either label or bosses heres to the next 400 releases
george paar is an alias of jorge castillo a montevideo-based producer and dj and the mind behind par recordings and its vinyl offshoot the labels have released much of the tough unflinching techno hes been pushing in recent years as well as music from a global roster of likeminded artists from lessio pili of italy to japans yuji kondo (who crafted a notably brain-searing digital ep as ducerey da nexino at the beginning of the year) the fifth release sees castillo link up with romes giorgio for a pair of long challenging cuts that might be too much for most the original version is especially ruthless long with a low acidic throb its main feature is a vice-like industrial riff whose hold loosens briefly in the middle nicely complementary variation from shows his soft spot for shadowy theatrics pulling back from the droning lead of the -side while pivoting on a few cleverly restrained transitions its a more mental than physical affair certain specialists will likely dig this two-tracker though it does little to distinguish itself from most other dark and droning techno
being born in the epicentre of summer partying doesnt guarantee that youll be a dab hand at knocking out slick atmospheric deep beats but as this latest offering from two ibiza residents suggests it certainly wont do you much harm in fact it might just help you to produce one of the standout eps of the summer tracktion ep is as the name suggests an extremely attractive trio of tracks to bury your ears in leads the way with a simple kick and a suggestive half-whispered vocal that continues to convince for the duration s helped along its persuasive (if hardly merry) way by subdued pads and lush layered samples that give the track an extraordinary level of depth equitable to many peace division and motor city drum ensemble efforts steps up the bass with considerable urgency; all rolling bassline and stabby vocals beautifully underscored by a warped piano riff which becomes more of a focus as the track progresses s similar in structure to graffs 2008 bang on drumpoet community but arguably a step up in creativity is an altogether different proposition but of near equal calibre while the previous two were heavy dark and muffled is crisp clear and provocative; like coming back to reality after a particularly overwhelming dream the hi-hats whip and snarl their way around the track while an insistent panning female vocal stab adds its own drop of sensuality
is one of the workhorse djs of the nyc house scene gigging constantly and manning the decks as a co-resident of the beloved tiki disco soirees tiki disco is considered by many to be something of a hipsters haven it is based in bushwick after all which is the latest williamsburg which was the new lower east side which was the reincarnation of the east village and so on but dont hold that against escobar who not only has a pretty good idea of what house is supposed to do (i e jack your body) but also can produce a pretty wicked version of the sound himself mingling old-school vibes with an occasional hint of electro/latin-freestyle bump and a healthy dose of disco groove his latest output a sampler from his upcoming all night long-player for the label is a solid affair with its four tracks revealing slightly different facets of the escobar sound the title track starts off with a syncopated kick drum and warm synth line la abacus 1996 cut phases and layers on a chirpy lightly-funkified vocal sample an arpeggiated bassline electro-style handclaps and finally a bit of ecstatic piano-house release things get deeper on basically a straight-ahead groove not unlike josh winks stay out all night (complete with subdued organ line) but with a touch of tremulous vocals congas horns and gently floating above it all a heavenly synth-string line on as you might guess is the disco tune of the bunch its sonic bed comprised of a bar or two from an oft-pilfered late-70s number and a woman imploring us to (you guessed it) get on down the closer could be a trax release from 1987 with its acid bassline modulated percussion and too far gone vocal bit is it retro surely just to hammer home that point plants made it a vinyl-only release is it derivative sure a bit those seeking an envelope-pushing experience should probably look elsewhere but the real question is is it fun undoubtedly
why is that germans are so adept at producing highly mechanised and functional electronic music s productions particularly just wanna get down and onandon in recent times are as sleek and efficient as german autobahns and the cars that whiz down them anyone familiar with the hartchef honchos repertoire will recognise as his production immediately: it s an epic eleven minutes of melody and flowing intricacy with detroit-styled keys that anchor it to the past this is a deep effort that s sure to receive plenty of play from fans of groovier minimised sounds the second track dba is more standard a shuffler which just about saves itself from mundanity with some warped percussion and nice echoed rhythm towards the finish but werner has one more trick tucked up his sleeve: moved is a moodier number with a xylophone and shimmering bead sounds like some exotic belly dancer getting jiggy with it it s a move away from the club and might be an acquired taste for the uninitiated but i like it this release impresses with each play and ranks up there with anything ive heard from werner a worth add to any collection
after patrice strikes recent house release wonder records are back in with latest release gwills is a very defined vocal progressive track it features some nice deep progressive beats mixed in with intensive female vocals to compliment the begins with some traces of electro type sounds and builds nicely as it shows its full audio self its not too aggressive and will work well in many fields and as you will read below presents itself as a great canvas for remixing who better to put a proper spin on this mix than current hot progressive favourite luke chable chables work with this mix is nothing short of on-the-money like much of his production work of recent months he has given the gwills original tune a new life with this very different sounding mix minimal melodies really give the solid bass line new depth and change the feel of the tune part way through the 2nd half of this 10 and a half minute mix chable goes a bit nuts with the effects moving between left and right and really takes you away from driving level of this tasty uplifting progressive dub you got to give this melbournian some credit for pushing this away from the progressive norms and sticking his neck out with this rather special and twisted mix sure part of the twisted breakdown may not be danceable but it is sure to knock over some crowds in the wee hours of the morning when the refined bassline kicks back in it makes the extended breakdown all that much more powerful somas dibaba provides a much cleaner and slightly more electro angle on gwills vocal mix a nice smooth eclectic house beat makes this mix much easier to listen to and gives it a much housier edge gwills trippy dub is a more melodic rifting mix minus the vocals it works very nice as a mellow warming/intro or closing/outro style track giving the release further depth on the whole these 3 mixes compliment the original very well and make this one very purchasable piece of vinyl for all those progressivey house inclined look out for work by the insignificant others as well as dibaba (with a 3-track ep) forthcoming on tracklist : 01 vocal mix 02 luke chable dub 03 dibaba mix 04 trippy dub
theres a trend among fans of dubstep to blame recent converts from dn for the loss of dynamism from much of the music one such dn convert about whom that could never be said is the dutch producer whose first releases appeared on marcus ntalexs revolve:r label he now makes deep and detailed dubstep and here he presents us with the first release on ppleblims new label oth sides here eschew the bass drop structure that is increasingly standard for dubstep is made from some of the same sound sources as roken : it builds up from clanking hi hats gradually adding more and more reversed rhodes and shards of breakbeats theres a real sense of self assurance and idiosyncrasy here: theres not a harsh sonic in sight nor a crushing third beat snare yet this bumps along with all the discombobulated funk of the best of the genre ll have is is my favourite of the two sides gain this is built from breaks bleeps and chords but theres some absolutely gorgeous vocal samples thrown into the mix the male and female lines descend together and intertwine gradually revealing more of their beauty has managed here to evoke the best bits of detroit jungle 2-step and early dubstep without ever making it sound re-hashed nstead this sounds undoubtedly like the future
s first compilation begins with body ( mix) by which subsumes uneven 2 step into his usual swirl of slow decay and sustain ts not the kind of thing you begin a compilation with but then a label compilation is always an odd little thing anyway theres been no shortage of them lately from some of electronic musics most revered and forward thinking imprints and one from the label run by and ben ufo a triumvirate of scene altering influence right there seems like a surefire bet for strong returns like the recent hotflush compilation 116 rising features a disc of brand new tracks as well as a look at the labels short but storied past the retrospective does a decent job of highlighting the most exciting moments from a label that manages to be on point almost 100 of the time ting exuberant outbursts like s junglist epic dont for and s next to more reserved offerings from and confirms the labels idiosyncratic sense of rhythm however for a label often held up for its vast range of styles comparing the disc of new tracks to the retrospective disc seems to show a more collective tendency begin to emerge while the label remains all over the place theres something surprisingly coherent about 116 rising theres a conscious move towards what feels like subtlety even when the lp hits the corners of its most experimental moments it still sounds tight and bristly and two producers known for heavy lash out bangers both rein things in for more refined variants on their usual sounds on the other hand s new(ish) housed up techno direction perfectly fits the labels slightly morphing aesthetic a little polite but a little banging 116 rising also has its share of weird moments from newcomers and staples alike s reconciles his interest in footwork with the labels currency in complex and dynamic percussion and out s on the fantastic where the frantic drums sound bigger than anything else on the entire disc s takes the cake though grinding raw and harshly cut jazz samples together and fashioning a slow (116 bpm in fact) groove with memorable snippets of conversation about having enough bass perhaps the albums strongest run consists of the contributions from and t a track from the legendary dubstep producer all the way back from 2005 fits despite its telltale trad dubstep structure says something about the range of 116 rising and the curatorial vision of and ufo pparently they care as little about chronology as they do genre despite knowing that about already its always nice to be reminded
the border between electronic music and everything else is fuzzy sometimes take c cile schott a french artist who made her reputation in the mid-00s with a string of albums for leaf that split the difference between folk chamber pop and ambient after mastering the style with 2007s les ondes silencieuses which she called a modern album with baroque instruments schott got frustrated and abandoned her musical career for other pursuits she eventually came back with 2013s the weighing the heart a record that added her earthy yet ethereal voice to the tapestry of gentle strings taking another step in this direction places schotts voice front-and-centre and folds in her long-burning love for dub and reggae rhythms making for her most approachable and otherworldly record yet part of schotts reinvention involved a move from the streets of paris to the shores of san sebasti n and like the record that preceded it has an air of seaside tranquility theres a childlike wonder to im while and are delivered with a casual lilt as if were listening to schott lazily play music to herself on first listen these seem like straight-ahead acoustic tracks but their brilliance is hidden beneath the surface the simplest might be the albums crown jewel: soft scratchy and vaguely mysterious it loops simple ideas until they seem profound schott has a way of weaving her strings into complex shapes and she loops instruments originally played by hand into impossible patterns on and thats where the electronic element comes in: she might be making almost all of these sounds with her own hands and vocal cords but she puts them together with software that lets her go beyond the usual limitations of a folk sound palette opener introduces another important aspect of bass more present than before the low-end carefully nudges her songs which adopt the placid pulse of dub as a kind of secret ingredient her music has never sounded more complete than it does here the dub influence comes out most obviously on a lonely lullaby that feels out the space around it with melodica employs delay in a rudimentary manner that recalls the genres foundational records right down to the way things get loud and blown-out when she gets trigger-happy with the fx like the weighing the heart the majority of the sounds on are acoustic but its what does with them that makes it so much more than the plaintive record it might seem at first put it on as easy background listening and find yourself startled by the jagged looping of or the distorted drums on but more important than what jumps out at you is what doesnt: silence delay and the hypnotic effect of repetition are as much instruments as the musical instruments themselves those are all qualities we usually associate with techno and thats where schott really shines
though dank atmospheres and dusty analogue equipment have always been central to his sound has never been one to settle down escapism marked a significant development from his 2010 debut album machine conspiracy leaving behind the prominent synth lines and going to a darker place while staying club-focused since then his side projects as silent harbour and versalife have explored ambience and hard-edged electro respectively sees him producing as once again but the music is closer to that of his other aliases focusing more than ever on atmospherics in that respect all of the tracks on are very much cut from the same cloth theyre bathed in static reverb and smoothly shifting pads and layered over a backbone of syncopated micro-rhythms each track develops as a long wash without distinct sections although these rhythms are more complex than anything hes done before they dont grab the listener as easily look more closely though and youll find a surprising amount of detail differentiating each track each creates a subtly different mood: is claustrophobic whereas stance is agoraphobic does this by varying how loose or tight the rhythms are or by making some frequency ranges dense and others spaced out on the midrange sounds meticulously programmed then there are tracks like which are made up more of high-range clicks and delay theres a powerful sense that the emotion has been somehow sucked out of them in the last few tracks some melodies start to glow through one of the albums highlights takes a desolate hook a lolloping bass and soft chord pulses and sets them bouncing around the stereo field in opposition to each other just barely eking out a faint harmonic progression until then the album doesnt have a strong sense of development partly because every track ends with a simple fade-out making the next one feel like a new start but this warmth serves as a coda to the album making you feel like youve arrived back at home is filled with nuances but most of them arent really arresting this is the kind of music that works best in the background that jumps out at you when youre not focusing on it though it lacks some immediate impact it has depths that are both intriguing and subtle
from the label that seem to do no wrong at the moment comes a release from stef vrolijk 16 bit lolita s entitled the original mix gets things kicking nicely with some solid house beats it s quite an intriguing release as the track is quite minimal throughout with no real stand out sounds or breakdowns as such nevertheless it is quite solid especially late on as a hint of arabian sounds sets into the track on the flip kosmas epsilon turns in a more intense remix the beats and baselines are noticeably heavier and the sounds from the original play more of a part in this very fine remix by the in form greek producer not a bad release from a very strong label and well worth a look especially for the b-side
davide squillace is one of those producers whos seemingly always there without ever being in your face hes the sort of hard-working reliable type who if you go see play whether at circoloco where hes been a resident for many years or any number of venues across europe you probably wont be let down and the same goes for his productions theres nothing outlandish about these three tracks for lucianos cadenza; theyre neither dance-floor dynamite or epically atmospheric the temperature of goi nia doesnt rise too far above freezing with string stabs and brass synths running into a meandering bassline that trickles underneath while squillace pulls similar tricks on this time the feel is of an intergalactic flight bursting through the troposphere in a flurry of cosmic pulses the eps best moment is undeniably which after the italian peppers it with strings mutates from twinkling tech house into something far beefier
often specialises in the type of techno designed to stick sets together the monochrome beats and loops that make the peaks seem higher in contrast the big tunes sound even more massive its rare that youll hear dehnert doing a big tune himself though if that makes his music sound workmanlike the same could be said of his prolific release schedule with the quarter century release on his imprint being his ninth album in six years like its predecessors such as 2008s k-8 and last years framework dehnerts latest lp consists primarily of the sort of no-frills techno he both spins and performs live at clubs like berghain and tresor you can imagine the corrugated stabs of bouncing off bare brick walls and almost smell the sweat dripping from the ceiling during the loose rolling groove of meanwhile has the single-minded drive and spring-loaded precision of jeff mills purpose maker series however as with its predecessors or indeed purpose maker isnt the sort of thing youd stick on your ipod for a walk to the shops of course you could argue that it isnt intended to be listened to in such a context but has been explicitly structured to work as an album rather than just a straight collection of tracks with an intro and a number of experimental interludes its a rare change of pace from dehnert and it doesnt entirely work the majority of these bits achieve little except breaking up the flow distracts sounding like someone burping up a ravey piano and is nothing more than a sketch something that might fit far better inside a 4/4 framework still the techno on offer is just as good as ever if those interludes have one use its to make some of the weaker tracks feel more fully-formed than they otherwise might and of course djs as always will find plenty of uses for sections of in their sets almost everybody else however may be left wanting by this foray into album territory from the berlin producer
s career has been nothing if not varied so his recent engagement with repetitive beats seems more like a temporary mutation than a wild change in direction 37 minute workout his previous album for diagonal was a fairly focused engagement with the kind of aggressive distorted beats that have defined powells label is broader in scope and integrates haswells more abstract noise work with his new approaches with 17 tracks stretching over 48 minutes is far from an easy listen it refuses to settle into any kind of flow changing at will from the techno approximations of and into the self-explanatory rush of no se while the differences between tracks sometimes seem great haswell is most interesting when bridging these contrasts together starts as a fairly conventional acid track a 303-style bassline winding itself around straight kick drums and claps during its three-minute run each element stutters or moves out of its comfort zone becoming distorted or pitched way way up by baking his experimentation into a recognisable form haswells disruptions become moments to be anticipated giving every skip or splutter an added thrill an album this diverse and unfathomable requires a certain receptiveness from the listener some days the plodding off-grid kicks of wont sound exciting nor will stuggle when it refuses to become anything more than resonant noise se tracks make sense within the context of the album providing some kind of reprieve but they can also suck out any momentum generated by the energetic pieces noise music is often described simply as challenging though it can be just as easily ignored despite its aggression and bombast haswells great talent lies in making the challenges of his music its irregular rhythms and abrasive textures sound enticing a welcome risk rather than a pointless deadening bludgeon at its best sparks a curiosity about the edges of sounds forms and technologies it has an almost voyeuristic interest in what happens when habits preconceptions and assurances begin to break down amid the sound of everything coming apart it all feels strangely alive
while rashad and spinn often get credit for helping footwork reach international audiences it was who invented the sound has been supporting kavain space since the first bangs works compilation in 010 and they released his long-in-the-making debut album in 013 now with the six-track they dig deep into his archives to show the development of footwork itself if youre at least a little familiar with the genre youll probably know one of spaces pivotal tracks recorded in 1997 and clocking in around 145 bpm its slower than most of todays footwork (which is usually around 160) and its written more like a house track with percussive elements that shuffle neatly in and out 03_0 -53_03 is a remix of dj slugos godzilla which was actually produced by anyways again there are hints of what would become footwork as space breaks the original into unwieldy chunks and lets loose a machine gun spray of hi-hats and + are where the modern template becomes apparent the former loops its samples into gibberish over fidgety drum programming and + rockets up past 160 bpm approaching the aggressive attack we would see later on the bangs works compilations is rounded off another raw footwork track presented in two versions one rougher cut and a smoother edit that points to the soulful style of the teklife crew its this kind of look at the genres rough-around-the-edges infancy that makes an essential document particularly for fans of footwork theres plenty of historical value here: you can practically hear footwork taking shape across these tracks even if something like feels tame compared to contemporary footwork its power is still hard to deny
for all his (often amusing) preoccupation with the very latest production and dj technology richie hawtin has always retained a healthy respect and deep understanding of technos rich history perhaps not surprising given his own veteran status lus has provided us with some welcome reissues in recent times among them lemon s anthem model but this double cd dedicated to the catalogue of berlins records is a considerable extravagance is it justified in a word yes was founded in by aul; its core artists were and these producers are hardly household names at least not in this reviewers household and repeated listening to suggests that taken as individuals their status is unlikely to change however it quickly becomes apparent that the sum of their efforts under the umbrella is utterly formidable and demanding of hefty praise this double cd documents the refinement of a terse and minimalist but thrillingly direct techno aesthetic and serves as a reminder of just how far our 0 minimal model all swinging syncopated (delightfully) fussy grooves is from the grievously honed simplicity of s first wave expressions of the form the first disc is comprised solely of tracks by and all of whom impress not just with their exquisite sound design but with their robust sense of shape and melody indeed it is testament to their dancefloor understanding and skill for arrangement that even the sparsest most industrial tracks sound anything but bleak standout tracks include s and sinewy the real interest though is disc which assembles ten previously unreleased gems for the pleasure of the curious and the completist alike kick off proceedings with a propulsive dancefloor bruiser driven as its title suggests by an irresistibly wobbly bassline and lashed with lastikman esque 0 lines its not so much ahead of its time as simply timeless and as with the other tracks that make up the compilation the only real date stamp is the hissing prominence of the hi hats that said one could imagine this track being frictionlessly woven into a set by luciano or hawtin tomorrow and bringing wide eyed glee to their dancefloors like s strips down techno to its stomping acid fried essence and so is unlikely ever to truly grow old selbstausloser incorporates warm detroit style chords but they are softened and submerged to the extent that you can barely hear them benevolent ghosts trapped between the brittle linear beats; elsewhere basslines are so elastic and acid squelches so exuberant that the onset of gloom or monotony is never a concern for existing fans of it all but goes without saying that this package is essential additionally anyone interested in minimals tangled lineage or simply in techno at its purest and most forthright will find plenty here to enthral and entertain
come straight out the leftfield of hip hop with an interesting to make the heads think differently about hip hop part 2 s production skills are considered ground breaking and futuristic while still being able to avoid that abstract tag which can usually mean hip hop heads just not getting into it in favour of the party tracks such as j5 dilated peoples de la etc stick n move feat blackitude the element in this track which grabs the listener s attention is definitely the phat bass line it s groovy and does the song justice if you have seen the video clip to this song (commercial tv will never play it but good programs like rage will pity it s late at night) you will see that the bass line really suits the video as juice aleem toastie taylor part 2 and blackitude move like robots as the video is sped up and slowed down not really groundbreaking footage but well suited to this beat all 3 mc s flow well to this beat which i suppose could be described as a bit if digi-dub or dancehall as their delivery (especially toastie taylor s gruff voice) has that ragga edge to it do you understand it feat ty this song has more of that nice piano sampling that part 2 had utilised in the communicate track he did with gift of gab from blackalicious and this track maintains more of that dancehall vibe with the syncopated on and off beat similar to timbaland but not as commercial quite hard to get your head nodding to this this version with ty is exclusive to the single
calling it seemed to be a mere paradox it feels so much the emotion the feeling of the intensity and purity of club and rave in the early days without resembling those gone moments in a fuzzy transmission floating between the seventh and eighth track of we get this commentary straight from the horses mouth s english is awkward and broken but his description is right on the money: ding is an album that harkens back to its influences for the sake of progress rather than nostalgia over the course of these eleven tracks paints a stark landscape glistening with steely hues of early techno and forming something sleek jagged and as he puts it full of energy and vigor ding is austere and avant-garde but its inspired rhythms and unified variety make it as compelling as it is provocative most immediately striking aspect of ding are the off-kilter beats for a techno album whose songs mostly chug along at 130 bpm the feeling of forward propulsion is notably scarce after a brief and vaporous intro - stumbles in with abrupt intensity an airy melody hovers in and the beat slips further and further into a dilapidated groove making it increasingly difficult not to dance like a jittery invalid on heavy bass kicks bookend each measure letting a flurry of hand-claps flesh out the space in between rhythm lurches back and forth with an arrogant swagger that seems to say alright lets start this shit making this a wonderfully expressive track to mix with on a restrained 4/4 tick takes things down a notch priming the listener for the hollow spaces ahead evokes a cavernous atmosphere penetrated by a crisp and delicate micro-beat creating a vibe ineffably suited to the songs title for better or worse things get a little misty-eyed on with delayed piano stabs adding a dose of chill-out room cheese to an otherwise stern track this could be the albums only misstep especially as the beatless mind achieves an equally euphoric effect with creamier eno-esque production nonetheless it is part of a graceful shift in tone that reveals s knack for narrative arc and makes the upcoming u-turn all the more jarring as mind dissipates the crackle of magnetic tape introduces archived the aforementioned statement of purpose from this piggyback segue sets up the albums most powerful moment: the fuzz slips back delivers three words in a staccato grumble true techno music and there drops the brisk and heavy beat to the albums only balls-out peak-time killer aptly titled everything it is an indulgent romp and s ear for production is no less apparent here than on the more experimental tracks after such a metallic climax sounds almost housey as it drifts by with syncopated bass pumps and ghostly female voices aside from estrange is the albums most emotive chapter its warbling melody recalls aphex twins early ambient works while its somber melancholy smacks of klimek or tim hecker ding glides to a finish with a shimmering ambient number that closes the album on a pleasantly serene note though has a style that is purely its own it falls into the fold of ostgut-ton very elegantly much like berghain/panorama bar and its illustrious cast of resident djs perpetuates the visceral excitement of old school rave by ceaselessly presenting the listener with something cryptic physical and modern with its lustrous aesthetic oblique rhythms and coherent diversity is surely one of the best albums of the year
during the past four years irish-born producer niall mannion better known as mano le tough has built a reputation for florid sprightly house music with tracks like mountains and stories for his debut album on hes streamlined his sound into a more home-friendly vocal-oriented effort that occupies the downier climes electronica much like label-mate john talabot did with last years in mannion constructed a series sumptuous escapes that form a concise pop-based album but lets start with some caveats: like 2011s in my rms prominently features mannions own voice a croon thats sure to be the albums most divisive characteristic on opener for example he emerges clear and almost too central: eat yourself eat yourself eat yourself/when you cannibalize when you categorize for those listeners coming to the epic structuring say those lights are lives its a startling moment and one that takes some getting used to on the title track mannion opens with a twirling synth melody and foggy bass buzz before his voice coalesces into the kind fuzzy balearic haze that calls to mind pional or even delorean lbum standout from bove turns one his gorgeous synth pulses into a vocoder bedroom anthem that still flirts with the dance floor primitive meanwhile is dizzying and disorienting in a late-70s krautrock fashion and with its wooden tick-tock drums is both sweaty and robot-cold yet the more time you spend with the self-contained atmospherics the more you long for the loose-limbed boat party nuggets weve come to expect mannion s a whole its pretty and peculiar but it mostly lacks the sly ear-worm languor his best singles nd ultimately whether or not you can get over le toughs occasionally awkward vocal presence its that conservative bend to his sonics on his debut lp that makes it at best a very qualified success such a young talent
can a record build a buzz if it barely exists this sounds like one of those tree-falling-in-the-woods questions and maybe it is but for the four 12-inches of the mmt tape series its less an open-ended philosophical debate than a relevant inquiry into one of rush hours more peculiar reissues of late hand-stamped and stuffed into paper-bag sleeves mmt tapes series 1- arrived last fall in quick succession and with virtually no explanation and then quickly disappeared before the aura of legend could begin to swirl rush hour announced they were compiling them for one big (and widely available) release thus ended perhaps the shortest canonization cycle in dance music nerd history granted each of the four 12-inches sounded like a classic from the moment it emerged from the ether: they wiggled like aphex twin tripped like villalobos slammed like l i e s singles and pushed through tape hiss like edison test records head-scratchers they contained whether deliciously extended or tragically short sounded like they could have been recorded yesterday or 20 years ago or at some point in the next decade you skipped through the original eps you never knew whether the next groove would contain squelching techno mellow deep house or even bother with a beat at all it turns out the tracks were indeed vintage though their creator jorge velez the jersey city-based producer best known as professor genius hadnt previously let them out of his studio whittled down slightly from a stack of lengthy eps but bursting with four unreleased additions the collection makes for an overwhelming straight-through listen but when you approach it as a treasure trove of off-kilter sounds its constituent parts shine through compared to the more polished music on his self-titled professor genius album or his broodingly focused hassan full-length on l i e s mmt tape series betrays a wickedly bizarre compositional sense throughout the set melodies rarely jive textures routinely clash and drum machines proudly get ahead of themselves but when a scorcher like series highlight bounds in like the long-lost feral child of jus-ed you realize velez left everything perfectly out of place
music s heavyweight breaks series continues on with the label s fine tradition of embracing the harder darker and dirtier side of breaks stepping into the ring for the third round is label owner skool of thought who straps on the gloves after providing the mix for the first volume ever since their arrival on the scene irish breaks duo splitloop have been making huge waves on labels such as sinister sound of habib and their own music downstairs label for heavyweight breaks 3 they re responsible for the second album sampler featuring the lead off tune kfc - a quirky electro breaks tune featuring stabs aplenty and a dirty electro/punk bassline and hot rock boy on a massive rock/breaks crossover tip christian j dylan rhymes inject a little aggression into the mix with the growling basslines and massive synth hooks on party people unlike soul of man on their y4k mix cd skool of thought has featured this tune with the party inciting hip hop sample in full swing bristol breaks producer 30hz gets the growling bass lines happening on no mans land this time with a darker grimey edge funky town by skool of thought brings funkier electro breaks flavours to the mix and is one tune designed for the party people (hint hint ) he then teams up with ed solo to deliver the bouncy ragga rhythms booming melodic bass and crisp drum breaks on hold up the tear out style of breaks makes an appearance with deep impact s carpet muncha which combines plump style bleeps with a heavy metal bassline dj quest s gravel muncha turns up the aggression even more with a harder edged bassline rolling tear out drums and a horn sample used in the breakdown to mess up heads to end it all scam offer up put up your hands - a big and uplifting ragga breaks tune featuring a ragga vocal which incites the crowd to say whoa and features its own crowd sounds to help things along is certainly getting harder and heavier as it progresses the fun party tunes featured in heavyweight breaks 3 would have been considered hard and heavy had this been released about 4 or 5 years ago volume 3 however has lost a little weight since the last volume mixed by deep impact which featured a host of hard breaks tunes ranging from tear out to grimey breakstep still for those who can t look past music s contribution to the breaks scene and love the hard breaks no matter what this is for you
cover art and press release for the fourth compilation ep from small san francisco label voltaire focus on the idea that its music is what a bunch of nasty psychotic animals would be jamming in a festering urban back alley idea is a stretch to say the least as most of floats by without making much of an impression let alone a psychotic one s thats sets the tone with a noodling jazz house plateaux s and s and are cut from the same sort of vocoder heavy cloth former sounding like a slo mo chromeo or dmx rew (who voltaire has previously released) works best as the latter leans too heavily on an uninspired bass synth riff strike rate is just as iffy on the side s blends assault precinct 13 style bass atmospheres with upward spiraling keys for an ominous sound that is refreshingly out of place cant by is a bit saccharine and s ack takes its glowing abstractions this way and that a few too many times unable to stick with just one idea
there is a lot of ground covered in bostonian s beautifully ballsy first ep for records not only literally (the sonic scenery seems to race by at a quicker and bumpier lick than most contemporary stuff) but stylistically too: there are references to everything from psych to acid sometimes they feel like techno sometimes house sometimes a grey area in between but they always deal in that revered quality of timelessness despite the firm and regimented kicks these will do damage on a dance floor theres an expansiveness in the soaring synths pinging cowbells horns and whatever else that keeps things human mysterious and even cerebral your mind wanders on tracks like as deep space ambiance osmoses through dusty drum work while the constantly shapeshifting is a dense and gauzy network of warbling 303s and clipped 808s that manages to sound simultaneously serious yet serene you might initially think the reverbing rubber pings of could be the start of a more stripped back offering but the spaces soon get coloured in this time with an echoing female coo and smeared celestial pads that rawness fully boils over on closer the most warehouse-y of the lot but still a fuzzy warmth remains
moon harbours brand of deep german house music couldnt be more in fashion than it is right now despite the fact that the leipzig label has been around for almost eight years with thirty releases in that time they dont churn out the records like some labels but the quality is almost always high of course when you count daniel as one of your in-house producers thats not surprising is easily one of the most consistently innovative producers in the german scene and his remix of marlows here is the highlight of the package percussive dubby intro gives way to classic synth stabs that ooze drama its a deceptive remix which is sequenced quite unusually the first half is all minimal clicks and pops but once the strings drop the track goes from simple floorworker to inspirational deep house anthem in seconds making it a real bomb for djs and a fine remix jackmate provides the next version and the rocksteady stuttgart artist takes the track on a more acidic journey sprinkling soft percussion over a 303 bassline and building a really simple groove this is a harder more jacking take on than s but its also a little more anonymous though not useless by any means to complete the package marlow provide their own remix a chopped up almost broken beat version of the track that carries an entirely different appeal to the first two versions and finishes off a wide ranging and worthwhile 12
jay hern and stefan schneiders first two eps operated at the blurred border where contemporary techno and dubstep meet but this third instalment sees them forgoing their bassy tendencies for a more traditional approach thats not to suggest that they merely aped that ever-growing cohort of producers who sought to fuse these two sounds: like its predecessors the third ep puts a focus on subtlety over immediacy and the alternative route to the road most travelled the untitled side favours subtlety over functionality with insistent bleeps and subtle drum patterns unfolding over an old school bassline the arrangement sounds like an update on classic sabres of paradise as if weatherall et al were transported through time to modern day berlin from 90s bethnal green the untitled b-side may lack the -sides quirkiness but it compensates with a succession of churning bass pulses and some enticing dubby reverb the second untitled b-side track sees the at their moodiest: the arrangement is sparse and stripped back the bass more aggressive literally growling at the listener as it flows from the speakers while this three-tracker may be too understated for many dance floors it provides a fascinating next step on the narrative so far and makes you wonder what theyll do next
reykjavik s have broken with tradition to release their first 12 by a non-icelandic artist in this case a track by danish duo krede buda under their moniker indeed apart from a few isolated remixes this counts as the duos first single proper i dont know if that name translates as clown or not but it wouldnt surprise me as their otherwise cracker ambient dub techno track is subtly and i mean subtly tainted by the inclusion of an unnecessary farty noise you cant really ignore it but lurking beneath it you can find plenty of substance in the heavy bass pads echo drenched percussion and lush metallic waves rising and phasing from the murky depths smooth slow burner with a heavy menace and a nice sensuality nd a farty noise thankfully minilogue are having none of it ditching the whoopee cushion and their remix is simply sensational t just under ten minutes long it is worth the price of entry alone the duo from malm take all the best of the bottom end so to speak and let it jostle with itself to create a flickering tension that opens the track the 4/4 bass drum is only allowed to kick in after more than a minute and the snares at nearly four accompanied by some drifting tribal percussion that takes the track onward and upwards on a progressive dub house journey masterful keeping things in scandinavia at least the last remix is from fellow dane trentem ller who returns to the more downbeat edge of the original yet plays more with melodic elements built over the probing bass the outcome is like a classic idm track in the vein of warp or rehplex especially when some warping effects are attempted but only to mixed success minilogue saves the day here part from the tiniest of errors this is a great single
in an industry with few second acts is that rare beast - a survivor after a string of mad and successful acid trax releases as rob acid in the nineties babicz has since reverted to his real name and recast himself as a reliable generator of funked up minimal techno his run of solid releases continues with this latest 12 on danish label out of orbit home of bright young things martinez and trentemoeller cristal garden is an insistent loop of videogame notes which energise an array of noises and spacy melodies expect to hear this rocking a somewhat twisted floor mid-set soon little moon has housier percussion and a pushing feel with mad scientist pads and effects raising the tension around a bassline of deeper fibre one for later intelligent floors but its the cloudpainter that truly shines: funky rattling percussion a subtle bassline stabs of a silvery-phased pad - this track is one to keep the smiles on the faces of demanding punters in the final stretches of the night triple-o have been making forward thinking house for a while now but its nice to see them avoiding another obvious pass at currently fashionable electrohouse or minimal already home to a roster of rising stars they must be well chuffed to have an old hand like on board moving their sound in new directions
dan snaiths decision to fill his recent fabriclive mix entirely with unreleased material of his own played to his strengths canadian artist has been spinning under his dance music guise since the early 10s but hes been more renowned for the music he makes as both and caribou than for his djing even so fabriclive 93 was destined to be judged against similarly constructed mixes by ricardo villalobos shackleton and omar-s which are among the strongest in the series snaith said villalobos especially was a big inspiration although theyre very different beasts while snaiths mix leapt enthusiastically around a wonky disco centre the minimal techno sound of villalobos edition had the self-contained feel of a proper album perhaps was conceived with that in mind 11 tracks from fabriclive 93 feature on the lp alongside a full-length version of from midlands fabriclive 94 thats good news for any djs who fancy using to give their sets some extra bounce or closing one in the same way snaith did on fabriclive 93 with the beautifully woozy end-of-nighter lifes thats possibly the only reason to buy if you dont already have fabriclive 93 which has more tunes and works a little better as a listening experience even so covers a wide range of styles and are strong deep house tracks s stripped-back bass and drums show his love of jerky funk s shameless rave breakdown is pure sugar-rush fun might have been nice to have full versions of fabriclive 93 tracks like the brassy disco stomp of vs but otherwise theres little here to complain about especially for those already won over by s debut album 2012s jiaolong fabriclive mix was much more than the sum of its parts but to have some of its best tracks available in this way makes for both a solid album and a chance to wonder what you could build with them yourself
has a singular approach to ing his sets span the entire history of african american music and his hometown of troit plenty of s might reference hip hop soul disco house techno and new wave as influences but few would try to cram them all into one set his persona behind the decks effectively an alter ego of kenny dixon junior is a complicated one at times he wants to avoid the audience entirely obscuring his face with a mask or hiding behind a sheet but other times hes happy to be the centre of attention using a microphone to shout party stating banter and on one occasion at a roller rink joining the dance floor mid set to help sell t shirts emblazoned with his image most often he plays music that people love but sometimes he seems to intentionally clash with the setting and earlier sets whatever the case his style is completely inimitable has often said he plays music that represents his environment n one interview he said he primarily plays records that are on rotation in his mpala might argue that his idea playing music that sounds great for a cruise around troit is pretty much perfect for a mix album and yet despite his nearly 30 year career kicks is s first his only other venture into the format was for his own mahogani label which was closer to a greatest hits collection t may have taken him a long time to release a mix in this way but the quality of kicks makes it worth the wait at 30 selections the tracklist is remarkably long but nothing feels rushed n part this has to do the 11 re edits deploys to help the mix move along at a brisk but unhurried pace first hour largely sticks with smoky head nodding hip hop beats from the jay dilla school of thought res work from local troit figures such as andr s platinum and danny brown associate forms a foundation while leaving space for left turns aplenty res african funk from triogo and s folksy guitars from jos nzales and house from rliner paper theres no way things should all hang together coherently ts credit to that they inarguably do the 50 minute mark the mix diverges unexpectedly into soulful house names like morrow and two bastions of smooth diva lead vocal house could hardly be less fashionable in played in another mix these records might miss the mark but here played adjacent to obscure future jazz they make a fantastic impact whats more these songs like a lot of this kicks are seemingly plucked from the bargain bins moodyman has ignored obvious or hyped tracks in favour of sleeper hits from artists that in the main have only small followings that reason the mix has an enviable originality things take a truly bizarre detour an hour in s recorded in 1984 is a mix of glacial new wave synths and heavily accented foreboding spoken word original is an odd track in and of itself but the version here is a live recording from 2012 t sounds like a cross between exorcist me and earnest bbc radio 4 poetry can only guess why it was included t mightve been inspired by ectrifying mojo the troit who impacted more than any other and was known for his fondness of dystopian imagery and 80s synth music that selection speaks to s obvious mischievous streak he has a penchant for the inexplicable whether thats his own complex mythology brading his hair mid interview or randomly slipping incredibly expensive singles into his album sleeves like wonkas lden tickets like so much of his kicks and indeed kdjs music in general these idiosyncracies can be enjoyed on a very immediate level or probed for hidden depths ts a quality that continues to make one of the most rewarding names in electronic music
stockholm-based alexander berg prefers to release records on labels he has a personal relationship with so up until now his eps as have come out on swedish imprints run by his friends for his first foreign outing hes teamed up with a berlin label whose only two releases have both come from its founder lando on recent releases has edged towards a greyer more techno-orientated sound theres more of that on as the swede turns out a well-groomed cut of gloomy club music the magic is in the details intricate layers of sound deft maracas ticking hi-hats gloopy pads are neatly interlocked gradually raising the intensity with each new addition eventually the seal breaks and a big brooding synth line is unleashed lando opts for a more streamlined approach firing techno kicks down a dusky tunnel of metallic clangs fizzing hi-hats and faint vocal echoes s solid but falls short when compared to bergs masterful sound design

s recent remix of vahagns relapse was her introduction on and the way she worked the track demonstrated her functional bent follows straight down this road the word functional can have connotations of drabness but this ep is functional in the best way possible the title track has a tight detailed rhythm produced with finesse from micro-hats and marimbas: its everything a rolling deep tech track should be the recurring lyrics hit a blue note briefly off-key to keep things interesting while im is a more filler-y version of and are an obvious pair theyre the type of techy wonky jack tracks that can come across as slightly comical on headphones but this is subverted into an off-the-wall surrealism on the dance floor with an uber-punchy drumline its something different to the other two but because of ruhs versatility theyre laid down just as solidly

over the years berlins innervisions crew have developed a knack for spying a hit record in ibiza their elegant brand of deep house does especially well and the success of last summer (ten walls gotham agorias scala ) continues into with two ubiquitous me remixes the first is an unofficial refix of dan crolls from nowhere ; the second is a take on by sailor i the latter lands as part of a sailor i ep on life and death the eps two original cuts are not what weve come to expect from dj tenniss label far from the dark and stormy tech house of mind against or the melodic electronica of tennis himself the title track is a big poppy dance record better suited to festival stages than club floors as sjodins snappy vocals echo across far-reaching strings propped up by a 140 bpm pulse its not hard to envision a sea of revellers moving in appreciation me do a tidy job of turning it into a sure-fire big room favourite mapping the full vocal to glistening synths and a low-slung bassline the fact that the beat doesnt kick in until halfway shows you the kind of hands-in-the-air moment the berliners were aiming for and on the other hand lacks the feel-good appeal of the other tracks its framed around a sluggish beat that only serves to highlight sjodins singing as soppy and overdone this ep might sit awkwardly alongside the rest of the life and death catalogue but its crossover appeal means it could be the labels biggest release yet
bdulla s most recent album confirmed that heady trance-inducing techno is still his forte his music tends to pulse ebb swell and drift it wants to engulf with its smoky timbres much of rroses work comes from a similar place the e ux bosss drone and ambient experiments came to a conceptual head last year with having never written note for percussion a record as much about endurance and patience as engrossing sonic environments bdulla and rrose make perfect bedfellows on this remix 12-inch for daniel verys ruminative techno head trip reverb and space are at the fore of rroses remix the notes echo across a bleak plane creating trails of sound like apparitions its a powerful and eerie track stripped of the originals functionality and transformed into something more subversive bdulla offers a different kind of zone-out on his remix of which is far more potent than verys version the originals prosaic loops have been replaced with some of bdulla s otherworldly neo-tribal sounds which he pumps over the steely percussion like noxious gas these two standout remixes have no trouble holding their own
have done quite well with their classics series with the likes of derrick carter and tony humphries presenting a selection of their favourite tracks from yesteryear the focus now turns to another pioneer in the dj front with presenting his it s quite a highly anticipated collection this considering digweed is behind some absolutely classic mixed already such as renaissance and northern exposure the mix starts off beautifully to be perfectly honest with hoomba hoomba by voices of africa and continues on with the delicate melodies and beats of floatation by the grid one of the highlights of the album features next when the seductive baselines of t tauri s joy to the world slowly build the groove early on there is great variety in this disc shown by the smooth vocal house sounds of the peech boys and don t make me wait the brilliant smooth house and vocals of your wildlife provide yet another great highlight of this first disc a disc so far filled with solid house the midnight club mix of security by the beat club provides a cheeky 80 s electro cut that will provide a bit of a shock the mix really starts to lift a gear towards the end firstly with the storming euphoric mix of mercurial by euphoria and then the deep groovy baselines of we came in by the classic dance 2 trance the end of disc one is quite stunning with great productions like desert storm and the always impressive underworld providing a nice deep end to the mix the 2nd disc starts off where the first left with a fantastic deep start thanks to the blue mix of beautiful by babble david morales provides a highlight with his remix of disappear by inxs and the juicy flow of disc two continues with another great house classic by dsk and what would you do the moody back to the beat by reese santonio is arguably a high point of the album thanks to some gorgeous haunting strings and a seductive vocal sample the album really builds at this point and the tracks are quite simply stunning like the fantastic def mix of jody watley and of course the very brilliant and ridiculously classic underworld mix of saint etienne the young american primitive provide a stunning title track to drive home the album with some nice delicate percussion and haunting riffs there is a taste of the old paradise garage with larry levan s mix of come on boy and it s followed by a deep hypnotic anthem by secret knowledge it is left to the cure to finish it all off with the very tasty a forest i must say that as a very big fan of i was always interested to see what john s current tastes were built on despite the fact that this album doesn t have john s early (late 70 s to early 80 s) taste it does paint a great picture of the quality of house music in the 80 s and early 90 s and as an album it is a fantastic double mix to put on at any time it is mixed quite well with a variety of seamless mixes as well as drop mixes and the flow is as you would expect quite flawless the album comes highly recommended and it is a rare chance to witness the tracks and tastes that have come to make the great dj he is tracklist: disk 1 01 voices of africa - hoomba hoomba 02 the grid - flotation 03 t tauri - joy to the world (no felt mix) 04 hypnotone - dreambeam (ben chapman 12 mix) 05 smith mighty - dark house 06 the peech boys - dont make me wait 07 propaganda - your wildlife (red zone mix) 08 the beat club - security (midnight club mix) 09 sheer taft - cascades (hynotone mix) 10 euphoria - mercurial (euphoric original mix) 11 one dove - white love (scott hardkiss psychic masturbation mix) 12 dance 2 trance - we came in 13 desert storm - desert storm 14 abfahrt - alone its me (alley cat edit) 15 underworld - mmm skyscraper i love you (jamscraper mix) disk 2 01 babble - beautiful (blue mix) 02 waterlillies - tempted (apple crumble mix) 03 inxs - disappear (morales mix) 04 megatonk - belgium (nintendotone mix) 05 dsk - what would you do (8 minutes of madness mix) 06 reese santonio - back to the beat (with the sound) 07 jody watley - im the one you need (def dub version) 08 saint etienne - cool kids of death (underworld mix) 09 hi-bias - drive it home 10 young american primitive - young american primitive 11 dj h - come on boy (larry levan mix) 12 secret knowledge - sugar daddy 13 the cure - a forest
to paraphrase donald rumsfeld brendon moeller is one of technos known unknowns new york-based south african is an established artist but outside of the scenes hardcore geeks he remains a relatively enigmatic figure hes never had a moment of being particularly fashionable nor is he easy to pin down musically though primarily an exponent of dub techno hes tried many different angles on his sound over the years whether solo (as mano blanco beat pharmacy or under his given name) or in collaboration with artists like pearson sound (as shetland) in its classy low-key way moellers latest full-length as wont change any of that is a purist techno album whose generally downtempo feel means its tracks are more likely to be absorbed at home than on any dance floor with the exception perhaps of the barrelling at times its fiercely contemporary the grainy flickering minimalism of could have been lifted off dettmanns latest record elsewhere moeller revisits trusted techno formulas but with aplomb springy wobbly ear-worm is classic idm-inflected techno likewise closer is a pretty confection of gauzy levitating pads and percolating 808 patterns doesnt do anything revelatory it wont grab you by the throat instead its one of those curious albums that you may well listen to come to love even far more than you expected its quality is insidious
the havent been the most prolific of artists but theyve always had a keen eye for quality control their tracks stand out due to their strong dub feel and because they manage to twist heads by resorting to small rhythmic devices placed within the minimal aesthetic this is often based on a sinister repetition of off-kilter sounds but takes it to another level entirely i have to say that i was initially a bit prejudiced about this record having heard a lot about it before actually hearing it favourable comments from ricardo villalobos didnt fill me full of hope either having come to regard him after his gypsy orchestra release of last year as having taken up permanent residence in a deluxe k-hole ricardo and the please accept my unreserved apologies the truth is that this is a simple idea brilliantly executed the lee mix stands out because it doesnt make use of the by now hyped opera vocal (who and what has been sampled please ) it keeps the solid foundation that runs through all the mixes though and gallops along at an even pace making use of a nice off-key bass which is interrupted by random climbing synth stabs that have a distinctly industrial tone samim whose stock is rising with each successive release turns in a remix that strips down the original to its bare bones and emphasises all that is interesting about glitchiness but its the original that stands out with its quite ridiculous intro of drowsy drunken sampled vocals its worth pointing out that apart from the opera sample the original makes use of a collage of minor vocals and voices which combine to create an effect of general queasiness while the bass kick keeps things nicely undulating a very strong first release from the only problem they and the have now is how theyre going to follow it up
the original mix throws up a housey groove delayed male vocals with a killer conga shuffle metallic percussive hits and bassy keys give the track a deeper element while a bouncey bassline and flightly sweeps keep you in the groove the breakdown introduces filtered hits that echo around the room until the bass comes back with a bounce i believe it found its way onto steve lawlers lights out g cd tigerhooks golden monkey mix is a tougher more minimal version of the original with great use of the delayed vocals the trademark tigerhook sound is evident here deep bass tough drums lots of attitude and that phat bassline bounce and percussive shuffle house heads get on it
splashed down hard with 2006s starlight a perfect gloss on circa 82 disco-boogie from its zingy strings to the wormy synth hook a year later they brought out all through the night which situated them a couple years later like the pointer sisters doing hot stuff in between came love in indigo and a right new life less splashy but still pretty good then record silence for three years while the rooklyn band at last count some 17 pieces big worked on a full album is its first fruit a four-minute edit is available free by joining the weareescort com mailing list and a 12-inch features a longer version as well as light-fingered remixes from ewan pearson and greg just about the two best one-two you could hope for on a project like this loosely remakes dillingers 1976 in my rain a disco-reggae classic in which the jamaican deejay croaks gleefully about knives and forks new york and some guy named jim who just doesnt get it its one of those records i think of as post-standards songs equally known as sample sources as for being covered and s unhurried disco approach treats it nicely the remixers are as judicious as youd imagine pearson offers a glossier treatment with the instruments glowing and glistening more; ditto the vocals which are filtered just enough to sound robotic mischievously slowly strips the whole apparatus down to nothing its good to have them back
res always been an efficient quality to s productions he gets the most out of every melody squeezing and torquing his riffs through countless effects until theres nothing left but a pulpless rind in the end its this studio skill devoid of pointless bells and whistles thats most endearing about his sound esser s latest 12-inch is very much in this vein reminiscent of kerri chandler -side is a joyous deep house track with syncopated claps and deep kicks in its engine room its a simple idea much like his and enny rodrigues gem from last year paradox with a gorgeous tidal melody building and ebbing throughout its a guaranteed crowdpleaser on the flip is more expansive and soaring rife with woodblocks and summertime smiles but a tumbling electro lead line changes its direction taking you from a sun-bathed balcony by the beach to the sweaty dancefloor ut best is the big breakdown which feels like a gigantic wave crashing and pummeling you towards the bottom of sea feedback sheet for this release was around two pages long but ill spare you what the djs are saying in short this release is pretty damn good its like a cold beer on a hot day its like a rose yrne movie on a lonely night nothing too complicated just two great tracks that will make you smile

by means of modular synthesis thats how scottish drone artist describes the providence of his work and its hard to think of a string of words that signifies more in this context y speak to literal process of course but maybe even more so to the kind of granular attention to texture timbre tone etc that gets paid by those who get really really really into sound for just a little less than 30 minutes stays static and evolves planting a pole in ambient stillness but following a through-line that moves in minute ways it sounds a bit like gas with rusty water towers in place of trees or even more so like the product of a lot of listening to eliane radigue title doesnt fit especially well: theres too much tension suggested here or at least implied to fall into slumber

many of s past 12-inches 2011s vox attitude this years sing like a bird have been dubbed out techno for the dance floor but his debut album bumps in an altogether different fashion trembling with creepy echoes and unnerving crepitations embodies the name of shuttles label (eerie) and is uncanny in the freudian sense of the term: familiar and alien at the same time its music taken far away from the club and plunged into a nightmarish version of the immersive sound worlds also inhabited by fellow italians dino sabatini and dozzy where texture and abstraction take precedence over conventional melody and rhythm shuttle recently collaborated with dozzy for an ep as anxur and his sparring partner appears here on opening track chaos as with voices from lake (dozzys lp with neel) sounds are twisted and transmogrified into shapes unidentifiable from their original source yet while that album instilled a sense of meditative calm here the music becomes increasingly sinister and ferocious shuttle may have a background in fashion but his closest equivalents in the art world would probably be janet cardiff and geoege bures miller a canadian duo whose work is haunted by hollow spaces and disquieting details hammer-and-anvil beats of bring to mind cardiff and millers killing machine a torture contraption inspired by franz kafkas story in penal colony other tracks like recall the score to david lynchs eraserhead like the baby in that film is something more likely to terrify you than be taken to your heart for what really drives these tracks forward isnt their rhythms which often feel like someone grinding their teeth but a slow and relentless rise in intensity such as in which sounds like a mutilated brass ensemble being dragged into the abyss not for nothing then is the final track called given the claustrophobic catacombs youve waded through to get there this piece of oneohtrix point never-style ambience feels like both a breath of fresh air and a blessed relief
if you chip away the jagged and industrial bits of minimal techno you re left with the more accessible and straight edged sound known as tech house now here is the interesting bit people have recently cottoned onto: add a pinch of soul and a not so obvious melody and voila you ve got deep house both and have been making the transition to the latter recently with modern interpretations of older influences deep house is back and getting its due s a approaches slowly like a well rehearsed lap dancer all control and tease in its first half the groove is tight less jacking than the duo s eight to nine on connaisseur currently the cause of a stir on the underground but it builds in layers stirring emotions and even toying with your patience which i like before five minutes in revealing a malfunctioning music box at its centre the tight arrangement and pulsating beats recall the early ny house of mr fingers or mateo matos but if you re looking for the usual minimal tech found on ctr you might be disappointed captains the flips celebrating his get lost 2 compilation release with an edit of fter his hectic release schedule on freak n chic and poker flat this dials down the intensity slightly pushing more towards the sound of a sunny sunday rave strips the track to its core elements and makes it nice and easy for the dance floor i m very much in favour of the stabbing vocals and vintage keys but the striking thing is how nostalgic it is nodding to heads like kenny larkin and kenny hawkes rather than mathew jonson (see: mazon ) this release reinforces the fact that deep house is here to stay (for a little while at least) and that the new guns understand it as a sound cemented in dance music s past if you like labels like connoisseur or tracks like the sun can t compare check these two shooting stars venturing into deep space
those who follow more or less know what theyre going to get on a new record: fun soulful house music with touches of disco funk and hip-hop it should come as no surprise then that von erckerts second solo lp his own ava label once again finds the cologne resident in familiar m t 11 tracks von erckerts latest is his longest statement yet and while it makes little ef t to push beyond the producers time-tested style thats largely because it doesnt need to his work with classic and hip-hop-in med house variations still results in quality sometimes even downright charming music few small tweaks show up throughout s von erckhert continues to make heavy use of soulful samples shuffling percussion and loosely swung hi-hats theres also a substantial amount of live instrumentation at work hand-strummed basslines often hold down the lps low-end while billowing keys and organ solos make regular appearances example is driven almost entirely by the interplay between drifting guitar and an aimless electric piano three guest vocalists bring some variety to the proceedings with adding layers of casual soul la seven davis jr to album opener singer delivers breathy lines over the records dreamiest ef t albums best vocal track is which sets alias soft seductive per mance against a bed of gentle organ chords this is where hits its stride with sample-flipping sluggers lai and coming directly afterwards se are the records brightest moments and also make a solid case that von erckert is at his best when focused on stoking a dance floor is mostly a smooth ride but a few bumps appear along the way feels a touch out of place in the tracklist and makes a clumsy attempt at flipping keith sweats make it last forever into snappy g-funk fortunately the pitfalls are short-lived and do little to detract from the records charismatic flow because even when von erckert misses his mark he still sounds like hes having a lot of fun and its almost impossible to not want to join in
ristols initially made a name for herself with sun kissed house records many of them such as days like this and on my own crowned by her own summery vocals on her recent lma ep for secretsundaze however she explored a more introverted sound closing track sun took on a ur style electro vibe that she revisits on this single for funkinevens pron label t the most exposed moments of the muscular croaking bassline brings the track a turn of the century cybernetic roadcasting system feel nyone acquainted with s oeuvre will know she never keeps things stark for long and sure enough the sparkling keys and enveloping pads from the intro filter back into the mix funkinevens 90s cut rework has a swooning jazz techno ambience it opens in soft focus style before a swell of percussion and a loungey yet club ready bassline add momentum to the mix s assured original is the pick but funkinevens version more than holds its own
i find it incredibly funny how so many compilations that try to market itself at the mainstream always proclaim that they have their finger on the pulse of the underground sound and so many times they couldn t be further from the truth unleashing mixes full of dated productions that have died a long and painful death by the time it appears yet again on a mix now club is a mix that is definitely trying to do the same thing but thankfully if those out there are looking for a good solid more mainstream mix of house then this should probably be your next stop unlike some other horrible mixes out there (ministry of sound annual anyone ) the first mix is full of some nice peak time flunkeyish house with some intense productions early from the likes of full intention rasmus faber as well as uplifting axwell mix of hard-fi i can c thru u brings some nice deep basslines into the mix alongside a nice smooth acid riff while fuzzy hair s summer anthem in a kind of voodoo will please those who like the vocals in fact the mix up until now is very vocal and summery but that does end to some extent with the very gritty philippe b remix of not so dirty full of wobbling basslines and tough electro patterns todd terry gets in the act with the retro house sounds of can u feel it while the first disc ends with the pretty average can t fake it by steve anders it s disc two for me where this compilation shines beginning with the superb jacques lu cont remix of depeche mode s tasty a pain that i m not used to layo bushwacka bring some chunk to the mix with their life to live while the booka shade mix of moby s dream about me is somewhat eerie and melodic at the same time the 2005 ibiza anthem in i feel space by lindstrom gets a deserved run early in the mix followed shortly after with booka shade s haunting manderine girl nick danny chatelain provide one of the biggest tunes of the album with the twisted build ups of it s killing me pryda s afermath really shouldn t need any description as shouldn t mad 8 s club smash work this pussy buick project ends the mix with watch out for the gnomes a gritty electro filled production that ends the mix of in a good enough way have done a pretty good job here trying to target the mainstream with the bigger tracks that have been heard in the last few months it s mixed well by piccioni although the flow of tracks probably could have been thought out a little better but if you are looking for that party starter album then this is definitely worth a look in
a wheezing mournfulness permeates s latest full-length for shifteds label its not from anything as specific as a set of compositional elements but more of a general presence of noise and entropy this quality isnt totally new for the swedish group (who now live in berlin) but while it can be heard seeping into 2013s strgths it didnt play the starring role that it does on this album have more or less jettisoned the colossal ominous techno that makes up the bulk of their catalog surrendering themselves to a creeping fuzziness they bathe in it soak it up and drink from it with a devotional intensity indeed the first and last tracks are hushed and meditative like opening and closing prayers the albums unwieldy titles accurately capture the endless permutations of smeared hisses and sandpaper swooshes that are the bedrock for these 15 productions its a stridently minimal sound in that regard so minimal that it could slip into a kind of monochrome if not for the impressive variations in rhythmic construction textural shading and style also know how to keep things moving the longest track is nearly seven minutes while six fall short of three tracks two ( ) and five ( ) find the duo crafting dark abstract ambient replete with choral voices that morph almost unrecognizably into icy synthetic iridescence tracks nine ( ) and ten ( ) are also heavily abstracted but gut their muscular industrial synth lines and scatter the echo-stained remains across rumbling dark matter then at track 12 theres a leftfield piece that ditches the ambient techno spectrum all together evoking instead the soundtrack of an early 80s fantasy flick thats been smudged into a strange whirring blur there are also a handful of tracks that more exploratory djs could mine for their propulsive traits the tightly structured loop anchoring track 13 ( ) contains just enough pulsating sway to get heads bobbing ditto for track six ( ) whose progressive synths ripple across pounding toms and metallic sputters and hums but those pieces are most potent in their original habitat boasts such a distinct internal logic and unified sensibility that communing with its haunted odes to entropy is an all or nothing experience

in a 2015 article about grime alex mcfadyen aired his concerns about the widening rift between beatmakers and lyricists he noted the number of intriguing artists labels and nights pushing the boundaries of instrumental grime arguing that it came at a cost to the mcs sometimes it feels like boxed and eskimo dance could be happening in different worlds he wrote and he was right nearly two years on the divide seems to have calcified boxed and eskimo dance and their separate worlds are showing no sign of crossover having said that a few strongholds in the middle are helping to prevent a complete split is one such artist and his records which was revived earlier this year has become an exciting place for traditional grime with a contemporary twist is his first album since 2012s dark crawler for hyperdub it lands after a stream of e s from danjah and other old-school producers like who features here on the dubwise there have been newcomers too such as who collaborates on the aggy ulse -riffing lanet theres less of a specific sound than a unifying functionality to their tracks thats classically grime they release instrumental grime for mcs and the lanets is no exception these tracks are to be used and abused by anyone with the gall to stand up and spit over them without personalities or diction to contend with its easy to enjoy danjahs skills as a sharp and shapeshifting producer has a quasi-tribal rattle to it with a big squelchy bass bursts of frothy piano chords keep the beat light luto strikes a similar balance between bright catchy melodies and heavier percussion while goes for a dreamier sound full of trap beats and heavy bass marks a menacing turn for the lanets it uses piercing string samples which are even better on they give the tune a sense of terror as striking as a classic horror theme is a blue club ballad while is pure sci-fi grime heres a record that could bring grime traditionalists and innovators together in the dance
the return of (aka sebastian lohse) is long overdue it s been a year since his debut flow/trombone on still anyone who heard that skewed and melancholy first ep wont have forgotten about in a hurry here he brings a four-track ep that exposes more of his distinctly jazzy style and it s mostly worth the wait on the a-side is a fusion of disco and chicago house with a deep expansive sound built around a quintessentially chicago bassline and organ stabs its seriously heavyweight deep house and it has a real musicality to it though thankfully the focus isnt sacrificed at that hallowed altar next up is a monolithic slab of dub house that carries a real punch to it this is classicism at its best deep stern and uncompromising on the b-side is the housiest thing on offer here looping detroit strings over skipping percussion and slow soft keys that fans of flow will be used to at times it threatens to descend into easy listening perhaps due to lohses immaculate production techniques last up is which begins with a deep dubby bassline and expands slowly and sadly over nearly seven minutes its the sound of house music boarding a train and drifting off into the night with a locomotive beat and wistful ethereal synths hanging in the air like smoke all in all this is another excellent ep from its also a release that suggests mr lohse may have a great album in him yet to come
future life is defined by sharp differences tokyo-based producer ryota arai (aka ) builds his house tracks on a slippery sort of funk but theres a parallel world above those thick disco-infused basslines the low end stabs of are flanked by laser fire; crying babies and ghostly incantations hover over s chugging beat arais weird top notes converge with orthodox rhythms in ways that are absorbing if not always convincing for example is too busy combining disparate pieces of its jigsaw to settle into a groove arai does better elsewhere: ties together a pitter-patter beat with cascading latin piano hollowed-out bass and ominous synths for a coherent expression of tension and contrast in other places only the constant rhythmic pulse offers comfort as rouses itself out of a caf del mar-ish slumber and into a state of mild panic s thrumming percussion guides you through his most cunning trick
behold my children the legend of acid house: imagine in your mind chicago 1987 where a small group of club kids led by nathan dj pierre jones give ron hardy a record to play at the music box labelled tracks by phuture its uncompromising sound quickly clears the dance floor but hardy hammers the tune again and again until the masses are converted and a new genre is born youve heard this story a thousand times and everything in it is true except it seems maybe the part about it being the birth of acid challenges us to rewind acids origin story to india 1982 and to move from a sweaty chicago nightclub to the home studio of a veteran bollywood musician in the 60s and 70s did time on the bollywood soundtrack scene and earned extra cash with his own orchestra playing popular favorites at weddings in 1982 armed with a now-iconic trio of roland gear the jupiter 8 tb-303 and tr-808 singh set out to update the entrancing drone and whirling scales of classical indian music its enough of a mind-fuck that rumors circulated on the web claiming the record was a prank spawned by richard d james a prank its not after nearly three decades of near-complete obscurity the record resurfaced when label impresario edo bouman snapped it up while travelling in india he had his mind split open when back at his hotel he heard the psychedelic mind-meld of east and west on his portable record player intrigued bouman tracked singh down: he was most friendly and surprised i knew the album i remember asking him how he got to this acid-like sound but he didnt quite get my point he didnt realise how stunningly modern it was singhs sound didnt appear wholly out of thin air as music critic geeta dayal points out both the 303 and the 808 had been issued right around the time and the rhythms of 70s disco had in 1982 only just reached indian ears needless to say though the word disco in the title is a complete misnomer there simply wasnt a genre called techno or house that could be invoked what stands out most on ten s is singhs comparatively original use of the tb-303 even though it was designed to fill in for a bass guitar the 303 was notoriously awkward when it came to reproducing conventional basslines the box was much better suited to produce the otherworldly squelches of dj pierre singh however found a different way to employ the machine dayal notes that the tb-303s glissando function the ability to slide from one note to another makes it perfectly suited for the sort of raga melodies that run slippery up and down the scale married to rugged 808s and terry riley-style undulating keyboard solos the result is a haunting exotic prefiguration of acids steely futurism a bit like kraftwerk live at the taj mahal somehow summoned from the past but envisioning the future at the same time
se days mixes and compilations have to do something really really different to stand out from the crowd take ricardo villaloboss fabric mix which is a new album in all but name or rland ye singing over his kicks compilation instead of just choosing records those that push things forward either innovate crate dig some absolute gems be a trend setter or just have damn fine taste in music maxmize doesnt push things forward track selection is patchy the mix doesnt really have any direction and s innovations amount to a few re edits ts a shame because new rave which is the scene hes trying to capture can when done well have an energy and fun which dance music thrives on tracks on maximize however are generally joyless dated and for the most part sound like a series of bad ft unk knock offs inclusion of the risible by niyi doesnt help as it will make anybody with ears want to chainsaw their speakers ont think this is a general spite at new rave because it isnt re is quality stuff out there say by foals friendly fires and buraka som sistema but doesnt on balance seem to have an ear for a good tune nother clanger is that the tempo remains the same pretty much the whole way through both s: electrohouse with the occasional baile funk track thrown in ts an approach ve not heard for years (think renaissance compilations) thought that the likes of optimo or rvng showed s you could do more to avoid listeners zoning out which is what found myself doing ll this has the perverse effect of making the few quality tracks sound absolutely amazing by is rough ice style destruction at its best and ainful by free blood sounds like rince being rammed through a cheap synthesizer and dam skys remix of by in has a fantastically moronic and chunky appeal ll make you sit up and open your eyes ts a shame cant keep you like that
s gloomy techno explorations have surfaced on boddikas nplus label with while crisp drums and subtle details abound hardly any light is found in this zone of deep space but the color that makes it through helps elevate the record above the usual stark-and-dark fare title track sets what sounds like decaying radio transmissions aswirl in a thicket of textured 4/4 percussion it uses a pretty conventional approach that may seem tired to some but its solid and more convincingly embrace an extra-terrestrial aesthetic both dial in monotone growls with the latter an ambitious ten-minute cut morphing from a bare broken-beat rhythm into a straight-ahead thump but the best is where wolski conjures a collage of softly cooing beeps and ethereal test tones ending this cosmic 12-inch with a strange yet captivating sense of melancholy
when it comes to lisbons endlessly fertile dance music scene local label pr ncipe has been the point of entry for most people now with cargaa named for a slang term that means hot or heavy warp have set their sights on the portuguese capital the uk label has put together a trilogy of eps meant to showcase lisbons bustling musical landscape which encompasses sounds as diverse as kudro batida afro house and tarraxinha the first volume of cargaa provides a vibrant cross section that should be a solid introduction for the larger audience that warp commands to begin the series warp wisely chose two of lisbons ringleaders in and the former turns in one of his toughest numbers which is broken and jumpy like an old crazy couzinz dubplate as with the best of s work theres an odd twisted logic to the arrangement but it sure as hell works on a similar tip s is up there with his wonkiest work nao s taps into something more melancholy; its minor key majesty wouldnt be out of place on hyperdub 17 year old gives his elders a run for their money with the boisterous which feels rustic and homemade s operates on the same wavelength and its the eps most arresting moment smoothing out the jumpy attack of s best material the banjos and synth horns paint an idyllic picture of seaside cool that feels a world away from the ghetto inspired grit of his contemporaries
armon baziles brand of deep has always been expansive; the type of sound that has you gazing to a darkened cosmic infinity way off beyond the stars this is particularly true of his most prolific alias in fact if its possible his latest full-length is even deeper than 2009s east oakland space program its stripped even barer and in place of human colourings like soul and jazz are distinctly alien details re are just about enough beats and recognisable percussive sounds for to be loosely called deep house but claps certainly dont sit on the two and the four and in fact regimented twos and fours hardly exist at all so awesomely spacious are efforts like the floating intergalactic bump of that its as if they have no outer edge whatsoever on beautifully splashy claps ring out into an empty abyss with only dangling melodic droplets for company res also a scuffed stuttering kick drum but it doesnt anchor you instead acting like a propeller steering you further through the unknown as clich d as albums that set out to be journeys can be is not but it sure does evoke the feeling of travelling on board a spacecraft from lift-off phase to encounters with lurching bass and beyond things move at exactly the right pace basically its never indulgent more propulsive dance floor passages like the shadowy melt-in-your-ears techno of and tumbling clatter of moons make sure of that sounding like early carl craig tripping with a modern day jus-ed on this evidence the deepblak boss must be an optimist: most visions of the future and space exploration involve apocalypses desolation and isolation but his is calm and serene with beauty to be found everywhere (though hints of menace do lurk in certain pockets to keep you on your toes) closer is the most soothing of them all suspending you next to echoing string-plucks in a sea of synthy tranquillity its a suitably blissful track on which to end the odyssey an odyssey that takes you galaxies further than you might think possible in just 44-odd minutes

in the grand tradition of major label maximization released 17 remixes of two songs from their 13th studio album delta machine remixes came from the likes of steve angello feed me and weirdly billy gibbons of zz top but this 12-inch is more geared towards the needs of techno djs on trusss remix of the new-school techno producer adds distant breakbeats to dave gahans vocals and submerges them in sewage with bits of sub-bass churning besides a heavily processed growl like many of trusss productions its raw without sounding self-consciously so the remix under his mpi alias is squawking malevolent acid thats an ideal match for gahans narcotic desperation switching between a promise ill take you higher and a demand you should be higher a burst of silence breaks through at the halfway point before the distorted mass continues pounding away against the incendiary first two both koen groenevald and berzones remixes suffer from linearity pangaeas remix has a thwacking groove and metallic vocal processing that harks back to hessle audio circa 2008 particularly pangaeas own you i djmrex a collaboration between nitzer ebbs douglas mccarthy and cyrus rex wrap up a solid package by turning into a hazy drone with a brooding off-kilter piano outro thats a welcome comedown from the intensity elsewhere

its hard to understand exactly whats going on with young nearly every release has the word jazz associated with it in some way a word that can turn listeners off just as often as it turns them on (the imprints explanation that jazz becomes the means for a reconfirmation of the world of house most virtuous only further obscures things ) in s case though you can forget the nomenclature and simply enjoy the sound which is well a bit jazzy not terribly so mind in fact likely owes more influence to the world of classical music than jazz his plinking piano makes an appearance in all of the original tracks here winding its way through the blur of minimal house percussion that reminds of the ultra-clean atmosphere of someone like bruno pronsato the berlin-based producer isnt a bad point of comparison: s melodies are always expressive but prone to dissonance much like pronsatos early work for orac what makes different however is his relentlessly sunny disposition and are suffused with a light that keeps them buoyant while seems like one of the most easy-going odes to contemplative unhappiness youll hear all year backed by an echonomist remix of the latter the only thing wrong with this bright and airy ep is its name jazzy or not these are gardens made for exploring

title says it all s latest release is the gloomiest installment thus far of the soundboy series of 12-inches s style has always been livid and organic but hes so far from a steady pulse that the music often dispenses with the step part of dubsteps moniker altogether nevertheless this is body music and of the heaviest most primal kind: waves of bass swallow you whole tightens once again invokes the dread-filled vocals of tenfold vengeance last heard on s previous release death not final unlike the zen-like calm of s classic blood on my hands the lyrics lurk just on the edge of audibility an internal monologue from the very edge of sanity percussion too is submerged in the mix a production subtlety that exhibits a clear progression from s more stratified earlier tracks sense of chaos is compounded by one of the finest searchlight-style throbbing basses since the heydey of no u-turn records but is just as strange with an even slower tempo and gloopier textures but in case youd thought had detached completely from the dance floor threads a racing bass pulse through the mazes of dub and reconnects to the techno/dubstep circuit that links martyn 2062 appleblim and others its not going too far to say that soundboys suicide note is perhaps the most brooding dubstep release ever (burial aside of course) oppressive atmosphere is almost gothic at times turn it up though and it engages the body much like more conventional dance music an amniotic tidal wave of bass pressure its dance music for hollowed-out men a rave for cadavers
this is the first collaboration from long-serving german producers and djs martin eyerer and oliver klein are you a sucker for certain noises me i love that tsccchhhhh sound that reminds me of the powerful dry ice blowers that they have here in singapores biggest club zouk back in the day i also used to unmitigatedly love any tune that used that hoover of doom sound you get on cj bollands horsepower the a-side of this release al quadus has the tsccchhhhhh sound so i like it to make an analogy with cars which i generally know very little about this is a toyota of a track its a little lacking in personality and wouldnt stand out in a crowd but its exceedingly well put-together and works very well for the purpose for which it was intended subtly syncopated percussion a nagging single note that hops around like a cricket on a hot tin roof and nice builds make this a very effective sustain track that could be dropped to good effect after a rabble-rousing tune the b-side cicada is more unusual its got one of those ruler-straight techno grooves to begin with and as it progresses the ruler gets progressively dented dinged and twisted into a satisfying kind of clanky funk they also use one of those where the fuck did that come from breakdown effects where it sounds like the dj has suddenly tuned into a random radio station for one bar before cutting back its manic and fun and has a pleasantly light touch at times (because this whole minimal thing can get awfully serious cant it ) this isnt one of those releases that everyone is guaranteed to love but some people (like myself) may find things they like in it and the pairing of klein and eyerer is definitely one to watch in future as they seem to have some chemistry together
the epic chords the rolling rhythms the deep yet menacing tones it can only be right well maybe the berlin producer has deservedly risen to prominence over the past two years with a series of eps for his fachwerk imprint and later clone that drew on classic techno now it seems though he is keen to try something different: features a more stripped back arrangement with a rough muddy bass underpinning repetitive computer game blips and bleeps its discordant approach is at odds with the billowing chords and epic climax of most dehnert productions but ultimately his determination not to repeat himself or to be known for one narrowly defined sound is impressive regelschritt sees him throw another curveball to his audience: over a glitchy lopsided groove he adds a soulful vocal snippet and the kind of cacophony of pops whirrs and clicks last heard on mille plateaux dehnerts ability to craft a club groove is still audible and while not as immediate as his fachwerk back catalogue achieves the same goal in a roundabout way which leads us to less austere and centred on a softer-focus dub techno composition its spine-tingling building chords nonetheless pass the dehnert dance floor test it goes to show: sometimes old habits are hard to kick
released on the oft brooding label fantastic mr foxs new ep bravely edges into romantic terrain but does so within the melancholic shadow familiar to the labels repertoire in order to deliver it fox aka stephen gomberg has enlisted cohort and label mate whose voice lends some dusky warmth to the otherwise bright and bouncy soundscape begins with a smooth synth build into rain-soaked vocal hooks that breathe life into the mysterious subject matter smooth sexy falsetto gets treated with gombergs playfully dubby stylings the two creating a perfect contrast between light and dark though the vocals on the ep captivate with gloomy elegance a track devoid of lyrics is sanen s standout on it gomberg demonstrates his penchant for textural layers with delicately constructed horns and hisses entangled in restrained percussion patterns veiled in the deep rumble of the bass and gleaming with the luster of all those horns captivates much like the entire ep youre left not knowing whether to cry or bask in the sunshine
it took a few listens to make sense of brian durrs last ep much of salience sounded like a radio tuned between stations the smeared samples and stumbling beats jostling against one another rather than sharing the limelight his next ep is even more puzzling durr has always combined styles in intriguing ways lately uk rudeness and a lo-fi house slouch but here he swills his influences together into a thick bewildering soup on the effect is compelling its core seems to be a crackly ragga sample whose rapidfire chatter and dub sirens are looped into mirage-like shapes the drums form a juddering steppers rhythm slogging patiently through waist-deep puddles of hiss and static soft pads enter near the end but they dont deliver a resolution is similar but lacks the cryptic appeal its chords sit way down in the mix ceding the spotlight to spattered microsamples in an entirely different key while the muffled 4/4 tussles with a drum loop playing at a different tempo at the end the kick stops and the drum loops clatter on for a few seconds as if durr finally got his radio tuned
it can be too tidy sometimes to focus on an electronic-music producers prior relationship with real instruments but has more than made good on his storied past as a drummer over the past few years numerous others have courted a similar style rustling rhythms off-time taps a squirming aversion to loops but few boast such a true percussionists sense of patience and placement oth are in high supply in the 11-minute house track which rumbles and bumps along with a deft mix of energy and ease it says something for pronsatos sense of development that no two minutes here would play quite the same without the nine others around it and it says even more that taking it all in ends with curiosity for what might yet stand to happen with just a few minutes more on the flip is tighter and more upright a nighttime highway drive compared to the -sides churning steam-engine stroll s a more active and agile floor tool its also less obviously indebted to ricardo villalobos whose shadow pronsato would be wise to continue trying to elude
next up on the imprint is a release from 17 year old dutch producer again showing the deep plans to pick up on production talent as early as possible provocation kicks things off in a smooth progressive way as the track begins with some delicate drum patterns surrounded by a nice atmospheric welcoming nice smooth subtle baselines come into the track alongside some subtle melodies that are joined by some more melodic business midway into the track very smooth on the whole from roel acid fool on the flip packs a little bit more punch as it flows very deliciously with some crisp beats and a cheeky acid line that twists and turns with the track the baselines rumble very forcefully creating a very chunky acid house monster an absolute quality release by someone so young and with a deep smooth progressive number on one side and a fiery acid tune on the other you can t go wrong with this release
when i first heard nyc producer on his early releases for rush hour i put him in the same fidgety 2-step category as faltydl his debut for chicago label proves hes got a few more tricks than that up his sleeve is every bit as restless but in a different way: it recalls about three different eras of disco at once all cobbled together on the back of a steady thump shrewd horn stabs blustery italo strings and nu-disco synths all compete for attention and the result is at once punchy and luxurious continuing the retro theme pairs a flamboyant strut with blasts of vintage synth its a simple enough foundation but its all about the offbeat hi-hats that stutter as if hes squished them together uncomfortably near the end of each bar; youll only notice if you listen carefully but the extra spring in the tracks step makes it that much more satisfying ends on a more downbeat note with the drowsy where a bassline that sounds like it wandered in from another ep gets massaged by humid synth work everything sounds slightly out of time but its an endearing touch and one that makes s music stick out a little bit more
with great artwork and a release schedule that runs like clockwork loco dice co work hard to retain s contemporary edge following a steady if not outstanding 12 months for the label they begin with label debutant ep the title track shows a seasoned purveyor of big-room tech house at his most comfortable male vocal and dial-tone synths stride atop a rolling bassline but its not until the swedes trademark delayed stabs hit midway through that the records power is revealed if super-clubs are your thing expect to hear this one out and about for fans of smaller spaces tini presents a brilliantly warped dubby take on the original promising sign of her improved production skills this is among her best work seeing us out is movin an uncomplicated yet effective display of the deeper and slightly darker side to repertoire strapping jagged growls to a tumbling bassline its dance floor tech house at its most refined
following on from infusions great introduction to tries to continue the great things that have and will happen to this label with the original mix kicks things off in style with a storming electro house fusion of chunky beats and a reverberating synth baselines that s twist and swirls around a spoken male vocal nice subtle effects come into the background helping to drive the track that essentially doesn t need much help thanks to the constant energy throughout for me it s the greg churchill remix that shines in this release thanks to an absolutely devastating baselines that rides underneath a tight high pitched electro synth pattern the cheeky breakdowns deep into the track are great highlights to this very solid remix all round from greg a very worthy release following on from infusion s better world expect big things from polaroid this year

if recent performances of stockhausen and remixes of popul vuh represented jan st werner and andi ma paying tribute to their germanic experimental ancestors then modeselektor signing them to the monkeytown label is like receiving similar respect from their descendants two groups might not bear much resemblance on the surface but modeselektor have clearly inherited mischievous humour; turning both preconceptions about intelligent dance music and its po-faced frown upside down however listening to 11th album in two decades you can also discern their influence cropping up elsewhere in the six years since their last full-length a fair proportion of the brainfeeder and warp rosters owe a debt to electronic genre-bending; and sometimes seems like the pair presiding over a particularly messy bunfight between prefuse 73 plaid hudson mohawke and flying lotus what this means particularly for anyone hearing them for the first time is that now occasionally sounds like a hybrid of other artists rather than a unique entity res a bit of modeselektor in the epileptic dancehall bass of and while the cartoon melodies and slide guitars of disguise the fact theyve used a similar ping-pong ball sample to flying lotus table tennis could be modelled completely in his image an r b ballad dissolving in vaseline that might have come straight off cosmogramma thats not to say that doesnt represent another intriguing direction in an elliptical career if every album has had a vague feel fluffy ambient on 1994s vulvaland vocal electro-pop on 2004s radial connector and aggressive proto-industrial on 2006s varchaz then the more pronounced use of vocal samples and some of the rhythmic structures on could make this the hip-hop one if you stretch and twist your definition of hip-hop as crazily as a kid with bubblegum that is be honest thats exactly what sound like theyre doing neck-cracking beats and lolloping gait of and gives something of a new b-boy bounce but the album is popping with so many other ideas from funky electro squiggles to abrasive acid techno that it often seems fit to burst yet even when it appears something like has exploded in their face halfway through suck the scraps back in and spit them back out in new shapes its often a mess but one thats always fun to chew over
fresh new electro rocker the 2nd sampler in a series from the forthcoming album from the widely acclaimed b l i m crazy thing kicks off with gated filtered vocals great opening to a great tune and then dropping to wired gritty devilish bass line wobbler only b l i m can produce wicked bass like this on the flip is coming to remix with meat katie more smooth acid style bits on bass all kissed with sweet female vocal nice breaks/house hybrid style another one for the box with things like this coming in your pocket is bound to be lighter
it seemed like only a matter of time before got tapped by rush hour or in this case a subsidiary label run by tom trago the amsterdam scene is small and vibrant its bevy of house and techno producers always collaborating and rolling between imprints its a productive environment and werners brand of spaced-out techno arguably slots in more neatly here than with previous homes like get physical and remote area on paper sounds derivative snares rattle 303s squelch elements disappear only to burst back in after spoken word breakdowns but werners touch is delicate the subs caress more than roar and the drums give the beats that slight swing so endemic in modern dutch house its all a little out-of-focus a little woozy like stepping from the cold street into club smoke five beers down things get even thicker on the low-end rippling like a muscle but slightly overpowering the textures above it the synths soar and dive wobble then collapse but the bass feels dull when it slams back in after an indulgent but goosebump-inducing breakdown all the tension evaporates its a shame because otherwise werner shows he can hold his own among his citys dance luminaries

this direction that deep house will continue head for early part 10s as people retreat from cash-sapping dance floors large clubs and instead find solace in more intimate surroundings living rooms and local pubs table and chairs pushed back against walls and dancing feet packed in space that remains if that is indeed case we neednt worry the soaring strings and funky guitars that listlessly pluck ir way through warm bass hits on s build such a gloriously subtle peak that youll no doubt have a moronic grin plastered all over your face by its end is more energetic with a big squelchy bassline and passionately wailing vocals but doesnt try o hard impress impressing massively as a result the -side kicks f with imposing tron-esque synth-stabs which warns a pretty meaty breakdown some minutes later it might not be as coolly restrained as rest ep but one hands-in- -air moment aint going ruin anyones day and it might even be obvious pick bunch my obvious pick though is its everything that is sexy credible and infectiously danceable about house music and nothing that is cheesy predictable and crass
altimores has involved himself in so many different projects matmos among them that he hasnt had much time to work by himself on merican synth outpost is his first solo vinyl release and its good enough to make you wish he would produce alone more often is the kind of record that asks you to invest yourself: the deeper you burrow the more it gives to you though it doesnt come easy it comprises two side-long pieces and the first section of the first side ( ) could scare away some potential listeners sputtering collage of sound effects and field recordings it sounds more like eilbacher setting up his equipment than a proper song rest of side drifts off into more serene currents through and the slow flow of survive rather than settling on a zen-like calm however eilbacher constantly disturbs the peace with glitches and interruptions as if he were picking at a scab y comparison the -side offers up more discrete sounds emerging from a smoky fog of ambience with the tremulous pluck of treated guitars s minutes pass the sounds get hectic and the composition turns chaotic taking itself apart just when you think its settling into a groove n unruly series of contrasts is unpredictable but it progresses slowly enough that you get a feel for its odd contours s it roams from one idea to the next it begs the question of what exactly eilbachers personal style is but hes got plenty of time to figure that out a musician who cut his teeth working within the projects of other artists proves that hes got a lot to offer on his own too
hailing from asturias spain (alejandro rodr guez) fits right in on barcelonas hivern disc label on the darkly dramatic title track of his debut ep his way of looping and layering vocals is in keeping with the styles of his colleagues john talabot and pional though his drums have a heavier more techno-like energy; carl craigs influence looms even larger in the tracks buzzing leads and generally epic scope of the song which winds its way from peak to peak and given its blood-red grandeur you suspect that is a suspiria fan as well remixing the track the barcelona duo aster preserves the originals mood while thinning out its dense sonics; they concentrate on loping percussion and wheezing organ while those choral thunderheads continue to throw a gothic shadow over the proceedings jacob s mix on the other hand pretty much guts the track stripping down to ragged hi-hats and adding piano low in the mix; moody and moving its dresden deep house to the core s again recalls pional; its a crisp kicking analog house track with wordless vocal harmonies and bright synth stabs lending a hopeful hue to its overcast skies and a portamento lead straight outta the x-files the digi-only (relaxed version) eases up on the drums while rhythm the other non-vinyl cut is basically all drums with a dollop of synth squelch for color; the bumpy understated funk nods towards uncanny valley
s was an epic slab of pressurized dub techno that attained its weight through characteristic sound design and pregnant restraint the picture often painted of career shows him as a fan of restraint in a broad sense and perhaps theres some kind of psychological link with the producer subsequently taking a shine to the track requesting to remix it and applying his and katacondas panther treatment to it that is the pair runs the whole track through a bunch of effects until its a strongly present echo of its former self as if at the bottom of a clear moonlit pool and adding a prominent round roland drum track the new version is as interesting and incommensurable with sausage factory dub techno as these production methods the combination of the crackling drum track (clarified and played around with on the eats version) all swung toms and splashing offbeat snares that smack just after the fourth beat in a nasty syncopated manner and the washes of sound around it end up sounding like a resurrection ritual in the depths of a pitch-black cavern it broods hugely those washes arent particularly unique taken individually ut the way they intertwine with everything else sends shivers down your spine
has always been mysterious partly because he tends to find a new sound for each project he has recycled mike ink and hawtin using modified turntables he has dedicated albums and singles to women a concept which culminated in his first full-length rosa while as soul centre he showed an innate ability to centre himself in the dance floor it should be no surprise then that after almost two years of relative quiet brinkmann finds himself with a new guise: that of singer-songwriter minimal techno producer does song-based album sounds familiar think this will be another asa breed wrong time to leave your preconceptions at the door as sounds like almost nothing else at least in club land this is not a straight-up collection of pop-techno songs; rather brinkmann has gone the whole hog and spent his time honing a concept album as dark and seeping as its all-black cover musically brinkmann s influences cover a lot of territory and the results are unsurprisingly often more non-linear and atmosphere-based than anything verse/chorus/verse coil is perhaps a good reference point especially in terms of the dark spectral mood such as on which is inspired by american earth-works artist robert smithson s jetty sand sculpture in great salt lakes utah the musical and lyrical drama of many tracks could even be likened to einst rzende neubauten or nick cave jamming with the cars or gary neuman that is especially on and the latter and it s even reverberate with monolithic heroin guitars reminiscent of 80s psych rockers spacemen 3 hardly minimal techno territory spacemen 3 s dronier influence also extends to which has a hypnomonotic repetition which gradually pulls you down deeper and deeper like staring at a dying man beneath a flickering fluorescent bulb at the intersection of all these groups lies new york electro punkers suicide it s not hard to picture alan vega and martin rev at the helm of the more unleashed and untamed middle tracks especially the maniacal but also with its digital funk and the serial killer reggae groove of yet despite all these nods it is always brinkmann under the mask his distinct percussive angularity and the alchemical processing of subtle sounds might reference 80s electro-rock but they are his alone and worth many repeated listens lyrically brinkmann contributes his own words but by far the greater emphasis is on other writers particularly those from beyond the iron curtain whose gloominess undoubtedly was a big inspiration to the overall mood the piano bar blues opener penned by tuxedomoon frontman and puppeteer extraordinaire winston tong features some beautiful phrasing by brinkmann that is slurred and bitterly poised as if hopelessly drunk or narcotised this itself is one of the keys to the excellence of the album: brinkmann is playing a role in each track conveying as much with the tone of his voice as his words those familiar with the track maschine from 2005s lucky hands will be familiar with its sound deadpan and deep his voice is burned into each track stumbling stammering and anchoring leaden words in the air its pure showmanship overall then is a rare work indeed short like an old fashioned album to which it pays homage complete thematically and with enough sonic depth and vibe to keep you coming back again it s a breathtaking record
joy of electronic dance music is for many of us found sense of masochistic submission to sounds and rhythms of mach es move like mach es to sound of mach es for that strange thrill of be g controlled by a mach e mehow it makes us feel less than and more than human but re is ano r side to sound of mach es which is that strange alchemy whereby sometimes most syn tic sounds can feel most human nd this is where we f d sounds are so slick sh y and plastic that y could only have come out of a computer but songs tug so warmly and wetly on your heartstr gs that y could only have been created by a homosapien nically this album is but a short hop away from budget histrionics of a million trance an ms sickly sweet melodies squelchy acid l es under slowly drift g pads and a general fondness for repetition however artistically it sits a class of own at this early po t year this is music for imag g a utopian future to for dream g of runn g through alp e fields with that cute girl on o r side of dancefloor and for hop g that this tune lasts forever and you never have to open your eyes simply stated it s truly beautiful music t this po t words run out and i ll have to resort to pictures: dance music albums sense of records that you want to put on and listen to all way through are extremely rare succeeds admirably at this task because it has both stylistic and artistic unity songs sound similar but not same and it evokes a variety of moods from exultant to sad but moods with same flavour of cool bright outdoor freshness which i hope is why xel willner chooses to call himself open g track will be most familiar and rema s one of willner s stand-out moments and beat g so complete a trio of clubby but emotive tracks contrast to rest of album which is largely ambient interest gly re are also two experiments less straightforward 4/4 rhythms od and latter of which uses disordered and faulty-sound g drums to particularly disorient g and satisfy g effect but it really isn t style of album or techniques used (and those processed wordless voices are used a lot) that counts here mewhere deceptive simplicity of se songs are hidden powerful sonic sigils to unlock secret places your bra knows some deep magic likes of which we probably haven t seen s ce 90s heyday of selected mbient works or brown lbum frankly it doesn t really matter what music you re normally to i th k you still need this record it ll make you a better person

uring the mid-90s at the height of his fame as a j was known for playing music with a distinct and powerful emotional centre se moods werent necessarily new in dance music a similar sense of poignancy had been explored in other genres but the appeal of s progressive house sound was in the framing his style suggested sophistication his tracks blended pathos and hope and in doing so induced reflection a friend once told me she wanted and igweeds northern xposure mix played in its entirety at her funeral and length aside i think its a great choice s solo music has been less important in peoples appreciation of him but at times hes captured the spirit of his jing 1999s xpander p is the most obvious example but there were tracks on the otherwise patchy airdrawndagger album and relatively more recent cuts on his emfire label coma comes to mind that were similarly evocative s latest album was inspired by his appreciation of modern classical collection is drawn from music he was writing as a sideline to his club tunes using the relative serenity of styles like ambient and downtempo as a sort of creative catharsis at a glance the tone of these tracks isnt too removed from core melodies lead pretty much everything here and the vibe is almost uniformly contemplative re are elements of max richter nils frahm and steve reich (all mentioned by as influences) while the electronic aspects riff on glitch-meets-melody acts like jon hopkins boards of canada burial and james holden is incredibly well-produced and not without its moments but these 21 tracks mostly feel like an indistinctive composite of their influences res little of the emotional individuality that once defined a few of these tracks are rooted in the club and the albums highlights come from this pool doesnt have a beat but it does have a big quivering bassline with lovely snatches of melody bouncing off it s tracks are subtly blended j-mix-style so on theres a bit of the previous cuts beat before it settles into a brassy synthesizer line that grandly swells and recedes could be the centrepiece of a j set its simple arresting refrain packaged for camera-phone moments but it bleeds into a track that embodies one of the albums main issues involvement of ultra stas nigel godrich (the famed radiohead producer) and vocalist laura bettinson means extra dollops of melodrama at a point in the record where the repetition of its core sentiment is already beginning to cloy a few tracks before it highlights s other main problem: its clipped percussion almost sounds like it skipped a burial pastiche attempt and went straight for a sample max richters 2010-released infra looms large res probably enough suitable material on to comprise a snappy little electronica record if you placed say the moodier and amongst some other electronically derived highlights the results could have been convincing but as it stands with 21 tracks and with the same earnest thematic button pushed over and over its a difficult album to submit to a comparable record such as jon hopkins immunity the uk artist called on a range of compositional techniques and angles to deliver his resonant message; on we always go straight from a to b mostly bypassing the qualities that originally made its creator so good
continues its ongoing project to further branch out of its tribal minimal past into different sound worlds with this s debut for the imprints one-sided 12-inch series following on from similarly dance floor-focused efforts from onur zer and tolga fidan the results are simple and powerful is a dub-soaked house tune that does nothing but bang from start to finish with a woozy set of orchestral chords leading the way unlike zenkers previously thicketed minimal for shimmers with the sort of unconscious ease associated with more straight-ahead fare but what it lacks in innovation it makes up for in emotional wallop s a result both zenker and are able to showcase their versatility proving that they each have no trouble grinding it out with the best of them n atmospheric fist-pumper of the highest order
looking ahead to 2009 you cant help but feel that is set to have an enormous year s label head trusme related in his recent r feature hes got more material than he can handle ( cruel irony for a guy who set up the imprint so that he could get his own material released on his own timetable rather than someone elses surely ) but the thing with the music on is that timing means little: these tracks are built for ten years down the road just as much as theyre ready to be slotted into sets today throwbacks are always in style: s long as you pick a tasteful era that is luckily and are 70s devotees (the era most resistant to the winds of nostalgia backlash) with their feet firmly planted in the present for instance takes a scalpel to a chicken scratch guitar on and distills it to its funky essence before rubbing up a synth riff and piano chord alongside it with some moody strings that tie it all together its very much a collection of elements ala love from his recent philpot 12 inch that shouldnt necessarily work together but whose tentative funk coalesces into something much deeper and fulfilling s isnt nearly as disjointed instead it opts for a solid groove that marks it as an excellent dj tool whose bassline wont make sense until heard on a speaker system that can handle it it pales in comparison to the unrelenting funk of though its a track that demands peak time placement and one that does little more than beat a surly bassline into the ground while trying out a few choice samples including a mesmerizing spectral melody over top to see how they work out if distorted house anthems are your bag you owe it to yourself to pick this one up for alone nd if its any indication as to what were to expect in 2009 from the label you can go ahead and crown them imprint of the year right now
albert redwine is at his best when hes juggling multiple ideas at once s a tendency that made this years voidic charms both exhilarating and overwhelming and its something thats even more apparent on the four-track xvx files which compresses trance rave jersey club and house into an eventful 13 minutes pivots on a hyperactive melody teasing trap before its barreling 136 bpm kick drum crashes in from there the track is programmed as a series of glittery gears and neon conveyer belts all working in chaotic unison finished off with a dusting of trance pads moving onto video game music pairs what sounds like a hi-res rendering of a track from earthbound with bounding jersey club-style kicks and cocking guns la grime the other two tracks let up on the information overload: is brittle and jittery centering on a playful piano sample while features supple hand percussion whose warmth feels almost out of place in s music the softer bass jabs on are a far cry from how the ep started on the the xvx files redwine finds new ways to hide the seams in his sonic patchwork while keeping things as adventurous as ever
makes house music with cut up disco samples its a simple formula in theory anyone should be able to create the kind of music he makes but somehow his records sound unlike anyone else both sides of this new 12-inch are full of the intangible magic that makes frank timms music so unique julies is vintage stuttering keyboards that sound more or less like an old jazz-funk cd skipping introduce the record slowly hi-hats and organ stabs begin to fill in the blanks until a shimmering disco melody is revealed but as soon as the records reached some kind of equilibrium begins to dismember things until only agitated blips and spartan percussion remain this leaves space open for an absolutely huge kick drum to dominate proceedings during the records second half this combo of gutsy sound design and beautiful melodic flourishes are exactly what s all about: he is after all a funk lover that has spent a large part of his adult life associating with the hardcore techno nerds at hard wax may or may not owe its name to the trammps 70s classic but it shares much of the strutting dance floor energy rooted by a bassline straight out of the bernard edwards slap funk playbook the track is propelled by soaring strings disco hits and those ever-present big kick drums these elements are perhaps some of the most overused in dance music but somehow doesnt sound clich d throughout this 12-inch once again proves that soulful house can be so much more than wailing divas and third-rate shelter records
white stalwart aka gilles aiken is among the cadre of producers intent on making berlin a house town along with his labelmates aiken has thrown parties throughout the city hosting gigs at nearly any venue that will take them its been a laborious process but white finally seems to be gaining traction oskar fermanns apple crumble beneath my feet was the imprints biggest release yet and will no doubt build on that success aikens fifth release for the imprint it follows in the footsteps of his previous works building subtle house tunes out of unexpected sounds it doesnt always work in particular rankles as yet another seemingly casual use of a racially charged vocal sample even worse is the cliched roland organ lick that completes each phrase elsewhere though comes with the goods of squeaks and squawks in all the right places giving life to the otherwise ordinary backing and hidden on the b-side is a simplistic tour de force of how to create more out of less each element is stripped to the bone bells sound stolen from steve reichs pendulum music ; a vocal appears but is buried so low in the mix you might think youre hearing things; hand drums appear in the final third as though its the most natural thing in the world its the sort of understatement that made s in the mood such a special track dont miss out because it doesnt bash you in the head the first time you play it
these days you can count the number of minimal producers breaking new ground on one hand but the 90s were full of them few projects were more out there than dimbiman the production alias of zip aka thomas franzmann aka part of the reason why the scene exists reissued last month is the berlin-based artists most sought-after record a three-track 1998 ep released on baby fords during the fertile turn-of-the-century period that hosted timeless breakout releases from fellow frankfurt-area artists like losoul l e and ricardo villalobos its anyones guess what has to do with the italian sports car referenced it its title but it reflects franzmanns experimental sound as a producer which is more twisted than the lean house he spins these days would have you believe even so these tracks arent dark theres humour in the scraps of sampled vocals what you doin blurp that come and go not least on which shifts up a gear when the bassline is beefed up past the midpoint the ep is full of these subtle shifts where new elements enter the mix at random you wont find any hints about s title in its opening monologue its in finnish and mumbles about christmas food the tracks mood set by scratchy percussion keys and hisses switches from funky to introspective with a synth tone two thirds through another crafty adjustment round s cosmic chug is the closest gets to conventional techno even with the stuttering middle section that strips away the melody outside of club der visionaere robert johnson or saturday afternoon panorama bar there arent many situations these tracks would suit in fact they would clear the dance floor in most clubs but thats not the point these are cutting-edge tunes that balance groove with experimentation a reminder of the exciting roots behind the scene they helped inspire
efore we start i should admit to a patchy (at best) knowledge of s oeuvre its by all accounts an exceptionally impressive catalogue of work though so it was with a reasonably untainted slate and an optimistic curiosity that i approached what ignorance i might have had before is on the basis of this record soon to become a distant and not particularly pleasant memory as this is quite simply a stunning track if all electronic music or music in general was as effortlessly beautiful as this then the world would surely be a better place im utterly convinced it would be nigh on impossible to show anything stronger than a mild indifference to even your most sworn enemy while exposed to the slow-building lush chords that make up pattering percussion and soft hats move the track along nicely but the chords are undoubtedly the star of the show with one of the changes so melancholic yet at the same time utterly uplifting that it sums up everything good about life in less than a second my only criticism t just over six minutes it finishes way too soon ten minute extended version would have been more than welcome here on the -side joris is tasked with making it more dance floor-friendly which he achieves in predictably slick fashion its more of the characteristically rolling bouncy style that he championed so successfully throughout 2009 and while in its own right a perfectly decent effort when compared to the original seems a bit brash then again id challenge anyone to find another track this year that doesnt

ever get the feeling that there are too many people producing similar tracks the latest release from is a case in point title track is takes a crack at being a moody affair with a weird vox spouting meaningless utterances amid jangly keys it s another stab at the now common-as-muck creepy minimal house routine this time stretched to around fifteen unbearably murky minutes on the flip is a real noodle and glitch fest with magda influences that never really amount to much minimal by numbers stuff like this will go down hook line and sinker with those who follow trends religiously devoid of groove and rhythm delano fails to match last year s successful collabs with xpansul and his great rerub of electronic resistance exposure is the point might have been a more apt title

the 4 4 kick drum may be central to s work but he is one of technos least regimented producers his work seems to inhabit a hall of mirrors playing with everything from techno to polka to big band swing many of his tracks are twisted and endlessly refracted until they sound like laptop based avant garde jazz a link makes explicit with 2 3 ostensibly the sub label protest is a platform for voigts frothier dance floor material but even at his most direct ( ) voigts psychedelic impulse is strong these tracks are propelled by crisp punchy drums and smooth basslines in the style of kompakt house but they invariably come loose from their moorings voigt layers them with bizarre samples (classical schlager synth pop field recordings) or arranges their loops in such a way that in a trick of delicious sonic disorientation they eventually sound fractionally out of time or like multiple tracks playing over one another on 2 3 or (a gorgeous confection of piano hang chimes) this technique creates real dramatic tension you panic that everything is falling apart sliding into chaos but voigt makes sure it never does during minimals heyday such sonic waywardness was commonplace and these tracks particularly the sublime super repetitive recall villalobos in his prime nowadays though a dj would need some nerve to drop such trippy challenging music if versammlumg is a protest against anything then perhaps its orthodoxy and group think in life but particularly in techno voigt wants you to think for yourself
andrew morrison has a nickname for the kind of saturated cassette-born house he makes as : tape throb its an accurate description on releases for the likes of leaving records and all city the irish producer has dug deep into a love for analog recording processes cheap gear gritty sample sources and groove-centric dance music everything morrison puts his name to pulses with big rhythms and is wrapped in a hissy glow a trend that carries onto his ep morrison does his thing best when hes not lost in the fog of distortion and analog fuzz careful to treat those raw frequencies more like a garnish than a side dish is the biggest offender in that regard a morose b-side cut it drags through murky string samples at first but finds its footing for a brief segment when the shrill noise dissipates and gooey bass takes over all three tracks on the a-side ( and ) are more effective as they get to the heart of what makes an interesting producer punchy and crunchy drums earworming basslines warbled melodic passages charismatic energy and an air of ghostly soul even gets a bit ambitious with nine-minute closer morrison uses the extended production to travel through a winding string of kosmische and house phases eventually combining the ideas for a rave-inspired hybrid with a show-stealing vocal sample at its core proves that though he may be reluctant can reach beyond his modus operandi without losing the essence of his distinctive personality
the label run by emg and john swing has always had the same mo: analogue club tracks recorded live to tape released on vinyl only ir style though has been elastic since their first 12-inch in 2010 theyve done thumping house smudged dub techno subtle afterhours fare and everything in between ir latest ep shows yet another side of their sound: this time we get a pack of blistering percussive rave cuts every record on the label has come from its founders either individually or together as which is what we get this time emg is the more experimental of the two (john swing is a house head as you may remember from his ra podcast ) and its his sound you hear most clearly on and are all tough and gritty drum machine jams aside from a gloomy chord here and a filthy bassline there pretty much all you get is percussion all of which is (as always) loose and dirty in a way that reflects their production method takes a different tack: this one is stepping and atmospheric with a pitched-down vocal sample talking about a rave at a warehouse compared to much of s excellent back catalogue is a little lacking in personality but compared to most dj tools out there its teeming with it
label bosses make a return to the label following on from the highly infectious grooves of rolands revenge and the cross over sounds of a good day for shirkin for those not familiar with the sound they are a blend of breakbeat with influences of hip hop funky funkadelic and house blended together to give off a very classic crossover breakbeat sound - something similar to the sound of fingerlickin in their early days for their latest single they stick to their production philosophy and also enlist the services of germanys circuit breaker to provide his take on one of their recent hits quite an unusual title for a tune moonfrog jive starts off with a disco style breakbeat and it doesnt take long for the 80s funky slap bass riff makes its appearance in the current era of fashion repeating upon itself its easy to picture rollerskates and roller discos while listening to this tune thrown down on top of the tune are chopped up vocal stabs and subtle synth work reinforcing the bassline in the background during the middle breakdown the bass line takes a rest and changes to a long drawn-out tone before the slap bass tone is replaced with a futuristic synth sound a verse later and theyre revisiting the breakdown again and replacing the futuristic synth line with a bouncy high-pitched electro synth tone circuit breaker takes control of the boards for his remix of a good day for shirkin and gives the crossover house-breaks tune his trademark sound style - quite similar to the sound hes known for with recent singles on moneyshot records and basstard - a punchy break with hard hitting snares quick hitting kick drums and hooky phrases loaded here with lots of downbeat rimshot hits the body makin move vocal samples (as well as others) and disco guitar riff from the original tune are preserved with circuit breaker giving this one a slightly different arrangement and electro squelch for peak periods on the dancefloor this one has been tested out on the dancefloor with good response im really into the circuit breaker remix as it has been proven to work really well on the dancefloor not too keen on the moonfrog jive however for those who like their breaks disco-ey and funky its sure to please
putting jittery footwork beats beneath chunks of r b tracks is old hat by now but from the opening notes of s debut album its obvious theres something different happening here but then alexander shaw is pretty out of the ordinary himself though hes a card-carrying member of dj rashads tek-life crew hes based in new york and his record comes through londons the opening track takes a delicate string sample like something from an old soundtrack and carefully slices and dices it jettisoning footworks crazed thrash while maintaining its thrilling speed is full of such strange tricks leading the listener down left turn after left turn and helping to expand the genres possibilities in the process clarity is most crucial in shaws approach which is rare for a sound thats usually associated with a speed demon blur recent efforts from footwork figures rashad and spinn have cleaned up the makeshift feel of the genres roots and shaw adds an alien palette of film samples funky instrumentation and eerie synths his relaxed style lets him riff on melodies and build catchy figures between the beats instead of just presenting an onslaught of stabbing samples jabbas sound can often feel stoned and even sedate creating a push-and-pull that makes more digestible than your average footwork full-length works from a well of revving synths but never quite lets loose while has all the lazy-day funk of an la hip-hop production but layered with dense hard-panned percussion somehow manages to bring to mind both drill bass and sample-heavy detroit house deftly pulling together two extremes thats the other thing about : jabba does so much more with his percussion than just aping his chicago brethren seems to touch on the shimmering textures of gangster rap and the bone-snap snares of grime while employs stuttering hi-hats trap-style these disparate styles all stick together on the madcap a record as zany and lovable as a childrens cartoon
is the debut ep from a collaboration between the british conceptual artist and producer roxy and the netherlands-based producer oliver kucera neither seems well known in the techno world but you wouldnt guess that from the sound of from the kafka quote on s soundcloud page to the projects stated themes jungian psychology archetypal symbolism and mythology its clear the duo want to explore the psyche eerie vocals are s most effective element is the only track without them which showcases the core of s weighty jagged techno style is their aesthetic at its most thrilling its built around an urgent breakbeat which is paired with a jarring synth on red alert all that is unnerving enough but a whispered vocal were watching you calmly panned from ear-to-ear pushes the track over the edge is less severe but it also features an alienated inner voice caged in by corroded brutal drums
mid all the hand-wringing about the deep house revival one thing is clear: there are innovators tweaking the formulaic to fascinating and personal ends you just have to look around a bit to find them dj koze lawrence efdemin are among just a few of the artists filtering the genre through their particular visions nd over the past year and change has added his name to this list as well crafting a sterling run of singles his third 12-inch and second for dial is yet another roberts runs wild with the smooth organ and pianos that typify the genre placing them inside three downbeat charmers that sound like little else around at the moment is the most classically house production opening up with the classic short/long organ riff but as the track goes along you hear something different going on underneath an unsettling rhythm thats produced by what seems to be two drumsticks being hit together its not quite offbeat in fact its often exactly in time but its at odds just enough to give the piece an organic feel the same goes for the queasy sea shanty house of whose cross-purpose percussion shouldnt work together but very much does good luck mixing it into anything (but isnt that the fun ) meanwhile starts off the whistling revival key: use reverb in a plodding and funky tune that begs to end nights and soundtrack dreams slow and melancholic it fits easily into dials catalogue without sounding like anything else more brilliant stuff from one of the most promising young producers working today
the tracks that brought his fame sat at the more polished end of the uk house spectrum full of dramatic reverb and epic melodies ut after a brief hiatus and a return with this years massive trace he seems to be homing in on a dirtier more bass-heavy sound hes started a new label and the two tracks hes chosen to inaugurate it are even more rough-and-tumble rchive01 seems to glean inspiration from bassline house s typical echoey vocal samples are chopped up into an infectious stutter and the track pivots on a rather rude lfo bassline that lends it an easy swing it feels like s own house-centric version of the grime-dubstep-funky fusion peddled by acts like visionist and wen using the same wordless chop-ups is like a lo-fie version of ring joy a highlight from s early career cavernous synth breakdowns crash-land into a more standard beat but its moodiness and analogue grit give it a nicely menacing edge
youre setting yourself up for a fall when you name a track im sure that with the aid of drugs a lack of sleep and a heaving dancefloor s would live up to its name but sober coffee-filled and in front of a laptop its the sound of now a minor league attempt at weird that falls far short of the mark blame the echoing sax (done to better effect in glimpses elephant skins) and the strings that determinedly mark time (again with the italoboyzs zinga) theres no problem with gerbers sound design which is predictably excellent it s just that the track is the epitome of trite with too little i dont care how much it bites from other people it still bangs -ness to raise it up far from disorienting me i found myself mentally checking off a list of villalobos-isms as they entered in right on the beat johnny busies up the original on the other side and in so doing actually achieves the effect of the title you almost want a machete when listening to the mannheim producers remix: the thick jungle of beats melodies and random sounds is overwhelming (clouds of sound bird calls ( ) and a flute all make an appearance) calling card for a possible future ep on vakant perhaps unfortunately is the only one on form here reboots rework is that most typical of minimal failures: in love with its own sound design theres nothing here that makes you remember it on first second or fifteenth listen like his work for cadenza reboots take is an airless hermetic environment that refers to nothing but itself sometimes thats a good thing here its not you can dance to it and js will certainly buy it but will anyone remember this ten years down the line
how you react to learning that chris titled his debut album after a don delillo novel might depend on your view of his day job as vampire weekends bassist fans will look forward to unravelling the literary allusions in clever pop songs while others might see it as proof that the new york band are smart arses in danger of suffocating under self-satisfaction certainly wont disappoint the former but it doesnt give much ammunition for the latter sure there are references to bergman dostoyevsky and abstract painter robert delaunay title track appears to use a personal crisis as an allegory for drone strikes which isnt far from delillo musing on rapacious capitalism through one mans journey in cosmopolis but s tunes are short and snappy and at around 40 minutes long takes less time than reading most chapters of a delillo book former dj clearly knows how electronic music works but doesnt seem immersed so deeply that hes bound by its conventions ll diots follows house musics rulebook most closely making for an average track by typical dance floor standards n smashes two sides of the musicians persona together: the first half is highly sprung house and the second is a folksy strum that sounds almost unrelated but the electronic elements pep up his song structures as with the 2-step-style vocal chops on has what could be the worlds politest dubstep bassline none of which distracts from s ability to craft a great chorus like the one that blooms in that track is an explicit tribute to david bowie and bryan ferry but a closer comparison for would be hot chip both his voice and the synth pop stylings on evoke lexis taylor co though recently relocated to london the merican doesnt quite share their quintessentially english sensibilities something he acknowledges on inspired by a painting in tate modern when he sings came to / n a city / still indifferent to me however proves that an outsider looking in can often find new and interesting perspectives
perc truss first came together for last years spiker a bruising three-tracker of live hardware workouts that felt like two friends indulging in the most abrasive sounds they could muster now that theyre jumping back in the ring for a second round the approach showing some cracks the barreling ebm beat and barking vocal samples of package together the best elements of percs the power the glory into something more punk but a persistent high-pitched tone in the right channel makes it hard to listen to (maybe thats the point ) after all that claustrophobic noise ven wolk offers a little breathing room its based on some simple distorted piano stabs one of the few instances of melody on the record continues the thrills with glitchy sound manipulation eating away at its low-slung swagger but after a few minutes it grows a bit tiresome the same goes for an absurdly heavy track in the vein of truss mpia3 project though staccato snares add some panache the relentless pounding is desensitizing
banner two years has seen get physical ascend imperiously to the top of the minimal house label heap ir signature sound smooth light funk influenced and texturally exquisite has in that time graced a plethora of mixes and magnificent singles including a sequence of massive crossover anthems while excellent long players from r and have demonstrated the label s mastery of the full length artist album a notoriously difficult concern in dance music this five year anniversary collection is therefore eagerly anticipated comprising one of exclusive tracks and another of remixes of key get physical tracks it should by rights be a landmark release nexplicably though get physical have dropped the ball one disappointment follows another on the of exclusives particularly frustrating are the new tracks from whose rather perfunctory is the first misstep of an otherwise remarkable fledgling career and r who appears to have phoned in with half his mind on retreading his vaguely sleazy schtick to no discernible purpose and the other half on a good book elsewhere and reprise their vejer single with half its verve and energy on ; and while m n d y and s take on ndersons classic is mouth watering on paper it s merely a pleasant curio on disc minor redemption comes only at the end with s terrific a sleek metallic slice of tiefschwarz esque electro remix fares better nstead of consistent dullness it veers wildly between ill advised attempts to court the indie crossover audience and mind blowing reworks which rescue the entire project from irrelevance lets get the negatives out of the way: the presence of hot and on remix duty is slightly dispiriting these are decent indie/dance acts whose riotous kitchen sink approach to production is entirely at odds with get physicals sleekness and not in such a way that the cross pollination bears interesting results: their approach to their commissions is akin to taking a sledgehammer to crack a walnut and to find nothing of worth within even these though are more welcome than moby getting his grubby paws on s anwhile se or and fakesch make decent fists of and respectively; but theres always a difficulty when taking on such well known anthems in striking the balance between using enough elements of the original for there to be a point in remixing it and asserting the remixs own individuality while fun the latin carnival samples of the former and the jittery speed garage beats of the latter do feel somewhat sellotaped on to the originals re is gold to be found amongst the silt in this particular river though dexters rework of ts is a masterpiece of menace all space battle synths and astonishing builds while the marriage of henrik s lush grumbling bass to the sinister chimes of s is one made in dancefloor heaven best of all are two contrasting takes on r s wistful ballad dont magnifies the originals melancholy in his rather beautiful reworking bringing s vocals out front and framing them with intimate glitchy beats and mournful swells of bass; herbert on the other hand turns it into a bouncing summery thing of joy resting the main vocal line on a bed of delightful and deeply satisfying cut up backing vocals get physical sound has always flirted with a vaguely coffee table aesthetic and this hint of lifestyle music has been a large part of their appeal but the attention to polish has always been matched by an equal commitment to a tracks substance; without the latter the risk of staleness looms this compilation isnt a nail in the labels coffin by any means: the stream of brilliant s shows no sign of drying up but it may well be a minor warning sign
elegance and emotion in dance music is a tricky thing theres something to be said for the stately sure but not when it comes at the cost of vitality thats essentially what happens on the debut collaboration from leeds producers elkat moleskin whose seems to aim for burial-esque emotional signifiers with sub-heavy physicality but lands somewhere closer to awkward hesitance on first glance its crisp synths lend it a nice glossy coat but its almost as if its quest for surface-level sheen has left it with an acute case of anemia throw in an obvious clich d vocal sample and a melody that sounds dangerously close to off-key and youve got yourself a tune more likely to confuse a dance floor than set it on fire london producer optimums reinterpretation of the tracks tunneling bassline and snappy hip-hop snares adds some colour but hes still trying to fit a square peg in a round hole and that nagging off-kilter feeling bleeds through his new framework brightons donga succeed most by completely demolishing the original and constructing a chunky house tune that barely resembles the original more like something that would come out on dongas own well-rounded all techno-swung kicks and bits of the phased melody of the original wafting through the cracks
one label defined the 90s uk garage sound quite like n ripe a nutshell they are to uk garage what salsoul is to disco are not the obvious choice to put together a mix of the labels music (what with them being american and all that) but scratch the surface and youll find that the duo have been following garage since the mid 90s when eli ldstein discovered a dreem teem mix cd on the cover of muzik during a trip to the uk with his parents boys even put on uk garage nights in their home town of boston in the early 00s so theres no question they know their stuff are at their core diggers and uk garage is just another style theyve got their teeth into alongside disco chicago house and hip hop rather than putting together a definitive best of round up it seems chose to favour the more obscure end of n ripes catalogue ts interesting that some of the labels best work is omitted: gether and all nighter from 2 hour time outs and behind masks cant self to name just a few ts easy to appreciate what have tried to do by ignoring such obvious anthems but in truth n ripes catalogue is so huge and so legendary over 100 releases on more than 20 sub labels that theres no reason for any track on this compilation to be anything less than outstanding most of the music here is good but really it should all be great ts also worth noting that the mix attempts to re contextualise the 90s garage sound through s trademark dj style tempo is significantly lower than it would be if a london garage dj had put it together s not necessarily a problem until you get to the lukewarm breakbeat section in the middle of the mix this plays to the duos love of r b but this kind of thing isnt what n ripe were good at have also tried to add their own flavor with a few re edits this is usually their strong suit but here their edits feel unnecessary this is in no way a bad collection of tracks or even a bad mix d urge anyone who doesnt know them to check out s or s theyre absolutely killer and typical of what made the 90s uk garage sound so enchanting: skippy drums jungle influenced bass and us house keys come together to create one of the most enticing dance music formulas of all time but considering n ripe is the archetypal garage label this feels like a missed opportunity real sticking point is that there are plenty of good mixes like this available online so for this one to really warrant your attention (and cash) it would need to be head and shoulders above anything thats available for free are great djs and n ripe was a fantastic label ts just a shame that together the sum is less than its parts
s latest single is taken off his well-received ody language: volume 3 compilation released on get physical and features a to edit by himself and matthew dear under his audion guise the original and the two remixes are a fascinating study in repetition and the thin line that separates a great track from something less aims high on his two versions of the track but it takes an outsider ) for it to realize its full potential the ep opens with the original mix and it has all the necessary ingredients of a great dance track t bounces along at a nice pace it is well-produced and it has enough variation to keep the listener occupied over its full length unfortunately a pounding bassline overshadows all the good parts of this track including a great cut-up vocal sample trademark of s previous work really a superb track but it falls just short perhaps rose himself knows this and he attempts to correct that with his to edit all he really needed to do here was play to the strengths of the track and just tweak it a little maybe recede the bassline a little farther to the background he was just a hair away from perfection with the original but instead he decides to blast it all away with a ufo swell straight out of the x files circa 1997 t s like one step forward and two steps back and perhaps an outsider is needed to add some fresh perspective enter audion known for his serrated almost primal take on techno nstead of turning the cut into a dance floor killer like last year s smash mouth mouth he offers a surprisingly understated take dear strips away the plodding bassline and lets the track breathe over the now extended eight minute length the whispery vocal sample now takes center stage benefiting exponentially from it and the delicately builds and releases work to even better effect than the original modulating just enough to hold the listener s attention past the full running time the addition of tangent keyboard lines is the final touch and this record has gone from the back of my crate to front and center audion could see this track was close to perfection and his hands off approach to remixing really shows that less is indeed more
compared to other styles of music house and techno are emotionally repressed straying as rarely as they do from club-friendly states of mind in a way this makes sense part of what separates underground dance music from its mainstream counterpart is its lack of overwrought emotion but in a world of poker-faced grooves a firm tug on the heartstrings can go a long way provided its done well enter an artist who somehow goes way over the top without ever sounding cheesy think of the gushing drum bass of re will xtc the vulnerability of all things the heavy new age vibe of his recent remix of efdemin now as he delivers soaring emotions of a type rarely felt by anyone over the age of six but with a self-awareness that lets him keep his cool aside from the ambient every track on ull takes a different angle on the same idea: the outsized melodies of trance packaged into house and techno grooves title track and slather bittersweet chords over punchy deep house beats does exactly what it says on the tin though not quite as well as s over 2 end version of efdemins parallaxis is the heavy artillery here combining little more than three simple ingredients a kick an arpeggio and the titular vocal in a way that would surely electrify a big room compared to his more ambiguous material as and prince denmark ull is a lark but its one thats impossible not to enjoy
have been around since the 80s but recent releases on digitalis and sex tags mania have pulled them into the spotlight for all the talk of outsider sounds most artists operating on the outskirts of club music are still pretty tame compared to the swedish trio whose live shows are the stuff of legend (theyve been known to wear tin-foil headgear while operating their vast arsenal of hardware) on record s take on acid techno is as demented as it is onstage and their latest ep for norwegian label is no exception over four tracks of raw polychromatic techno move from dubby atmospheres to explosive mania the no-nonsense beat of is a backdrop for all manner of baroque analogue noodlings while is sparser with a terse bassline oozing acid riffs and big splashy snares strange as they are and are subdued compared to what follows bubbles with frenzied synth whoops and squiggles and s high-octane percussion and three-note loop lock you in the tight grip of a deranged groove
when it rains it pours in addition to normal business practices new yorks thema has two new sublabels in the off this summer the first is which combined with various remix projects outtakes and sides from the parent and digital labels will function as a showcase for some of the more esoteric creations from our ever expanding roster of artists the second a bit less confusing: vinyl only you can excuse the open ended nature of the label though if you give its first release a listen while its a coherent batch of tracks spcl 01 offers up a varied enough sound palette to appeal to a number of different djs quenums late night remix of lads whos of ob is a strident bit of minimal thats cut through with a wavery bit of melody that is closest in sound to a theremin quenums sound design is impeccable mixing and matching digital with grittier bits and pieces that give the track a depth of sound s meanwhile is a straightforward bit of melodic techno that lazes about hiding its tasteful congas in the corners where theyre barely perceptible ernesto ferreryas rework of caps it all off with a cross between the two tracks that have preceded it: deep organ pads warm you up skittering percussion and subtle panning of recurring elements never let you forget that theres a machine hard at work as well
sidsel endresen and bugge wesseltoft are two veteran norwegian jazz artists endresen a singer wesseltoft a pianist who seem to have made a strong impression on berlins morning-techno label sleep is commercial samples from the duos 1998 album duplex ride now find themselves fitted into a vinyl collection of remixes from hubble public (aka bruno pronsato and ninca leece) and andrea ferlin the soft vocals and plaintive bits of piano from seem to be the focus of these four edits and hubbles version which augments the dreary source material with simple dusty percussion and spaced-out drones feels most faithful to the original public s reinterpretation has singer leece on lead vocals twisting up a few of the original lyrics and adding plenty of decadent charm coupled with pronsatos lively drums (and some particularly nifty basslines) its hard to resist public s playful pull but ferlins two efforts are just as worthy of attention his s e with its cut-up vocal loops and gorgeous atmospherics stands in contrast to hubbles dirge-like edit but my favorite track of the bunch is probably the remix theres a delightful break in the middle of that one which answers endresens calls with mellow noodly vibraphone riffs a surefire way to prod tired bodies and minds back onto the floor for just a few more hours

two young production talents in luke dzierzak and nick liousias team up to deliver the next release on the label the wrongans randoms ep randoms is first up and it delivers some tough gritty electro bleepy mayhem the track flows well with some pretty crisp and clicky percussive elements and of course the main electro fuelled bassline which takes centre stage for the most part of the track wrongans has a bouncier approach with the low end sounds reverberating all through the production creating a pretty groovy sound on the whole despite its groove the track is quite a peak time production thanks to the strong basslines and filtered percussive breakdowns a pretty good release here despite both tracks not having a great deal of originality
itd be hard to overstate how striking it was to hear back at the beginning of what would be called microhouse the duos leading edge owed to their minimalism of course but more lasting than that was the way they framed minimalism against notions of spirit sensuality sweat the makings of house essentially and matters rarely applied to the syllabus of minimalistic studies its a tribute to s influence that the idea doesnt sound the least bit extraordinary or surprising now and it certainly doesnt as it plays out in three tracks from the new album black swan collected here kicks off with bongos a little chicago-style syncopated percussion pinched hi-hats a fleshy simulated handclap beat all of it solid but none of it especially striking ups the speed a touch but s sense of space gives it all a drifting quality still lays backs and leans into some vocal cut-up processing that calls to mind old clicks-and-cuts atomization its the most unusual track here and the best for the same reason

s name usually appears alongside ewan pearsons (with whom he collaborates as partial rts the duo behind the infectious trauermusik) or encased in parentheses as a remixer for zero 7 camille and my winehouse among others so when mr usher steps out on his own as he has on the ep its usually an event worth the cost of admission this debut release on a joint venture between pearson sasse and unnamed others is indeed a momentous occasion containing two groove-heavy originals and a remix by seasoned veterans swag the title cut moves at an unhurried near-balearic pace with instrumentation to match drowsy cowbells a reverberating synth line effortless guitar leads and distorted bass thwacks usher keeps the formula interesting with ethereal melodies that drift in and out of the mix evoking a hazy disco with ghosts on the guestlist swag s dub hollows out the track and focuses on the synth line which plays anchor to similarly-styled guitar and bass licks its a bit friendlier for mixing but lacks the narcotic charm of the original slyly tucked away in is a secret weapon track if ive ever heard one two layers of pulsating string arrangements and spastic woodblock pocks form a dizzying rhythmic assault that boils over at the arrival of a fat bottomed bassline ushers blend of high-minded ornate construction and ass-centered riffs is certain to put a euphoric sway in dancers step and has been road-tested by lindstrom and prins thomas on their radio 1 essential mix the ep and its stand out make me wish would put out solo records more than once a blue moon nother release would be appreciated too hook it up ewan

idiosyncratic house productions are rarely lacking in a sense of fun but unknown to the unknown seems to bring out his party side on his debut for the label the chief attraction was woo right burns take on a wailing new york diva anthem here its whose claustrophobic groove low-bitrate vocal and relentless two-note bassline suggest something altogether cheaper and nastier which isnt to denigrate it one bit its a banger particularly set alongside f t which recasts one of the tracks refrains as a gorgeous after-hours zonk-out perhaps burns is trying to show us what desire looks like from both ends of a long long night or perhaps hes just hammering his e-mu sp12 until something good comes out regardless every body offers the best of both worlds: the boisterous ping-pong beat is aimed squarely at the rump but the titular vocal sample is looped and filtered into a wash of sound suitable for small-hours hypnosis ts a simple technique but one with surprisingly euphoric effects finally is a heads-down workout just to balance things out n this age of technological abundance the breadth of ideas burns continues to wring from his simple tools is humbling
theres something inherently satisfying about the drum breaks in it could be how crisp they sound it could be the long gone ideals of rave they conjure up or it could just be that they sound so goddamn heavy the obnoxious kathy rown sample and the fiery subwoofer lashings in the first drop are all dialed up to 11 and the sheer defiance of it all is delicious nd just like old hardcore its tied in with the side of classic chicago house that too often goes ignored: its adrenaline rush doesnt have the same hooky attack but moves with a similar strut its rusty creak has more in common with vintage hip-hop at least until the reverse hoover synths hit reminding us of s continued worship of his rave forebears nd just like the era he evokes the main attraction to this music is that it simply doesnt give a shit in a time when heavy dance music is out of fashion unless its packed into a straight techno beat is like a meteor strike
snuck out in august as a no-info white label on the made-up label this meeting of the disco minds (and generations) gets a full digital release via plant music this is new york dj beto craviotos first production; whatever/whatever member justin strausss career dates back to gigs at the mudd club and a single on stiff records (more recently with his production partner bryan mette whatever/whatever have remixed the likes of jacques greene yacht and woolfy ) brings appropriately old school vibes with a dizzy drizzle of rhodes keys over a crisp machine beat and faraway vocals lending a wistful touch its a simple track but effective churning plucky bass riffs and sampled loops until its all as fluffy as butter remixes from eddie and both exploit the tunes laidback late summer air preserving both its 110 bpm tempo and its faintly nostalgic air; eddie replaces the rhodes with bright sumptuous synthesizers while goes for a fine filigree of funk guitars and a buoyant vibe you might call ambient afrobeat l i e s willie takes the most liberties with his interpretation; his new beat mix is a lo-fi synth reduction that digs into its minor-key arpeggios like a dog worries a bone
how abstract can you make techno and still call it techno how noisy can you get before its all washed away in a torrent of fuzz these are the kind of questions bristol duo pose with their second album a pulsating storm of distorted frequencies that occasionally takes the shape of intelligible beats is a move conscious or not towards outright accessibility even though it mostly abandons their eponymous debut albums more distinctly beat-oriented structure the pre-album single altogether lost released on techno label clr and represented here in instrumental form as is the best indication of s new sound altogether lost played backing track to a frantic sermon from underground resistance mc cornelius harris but it remains electrifying on the album as becoming more fierce with every intensifying bar remixed by chris liebing and ben klock among others the techno connection becomes more obvious the momentum and energy that characterized altogether lost wasnt just a fluke and it powers from the inside creating a surprisingly propulsive album in the process techno isnt the only reference point the low-end bombs in are redolent of scorn and early dubstep and the way each track methodically repeats in odd formations with unremitting focus owes something to dub music as well territory both members are no doubt well-versed in the determined cycling of each chord progression numbs the pain of serrated frequencies even when the pain threshold is crossed as on the harsh tunnelling of or the white noise screams of the tracks simply burn themselves out for territory that would usually be so unapproachable seems designed for easy consumption: songs rarely breach four minutes and the album registers at a scant forty minutes its allows the duo to be as abrasive as they need to be without sacrificing an audience its simultaneously cohesive keeping the same palette of sounds across the board and refreshingly mutable for this kind of conceptual conceit with more melody and variation than you might expect from your typical noise album and while its hard to pick out individual highlights thats part of the albums unique success is a song-based album with no real songs those attracted to recent strains of techno aligned with early industrial perc trax clr ancient methods will find as much to love in as those more inclined to extreme sound design
fter a few disappointing releases it was an open question as to whether stimming was a mere one-trick production pony his contribution to s 50th release doesnt help to clear things up: the percussion flourishes gloopy bass and mark-it-down-because-you-know-youre-going-to-hear-it-now breakdowns are all present and accounted for ut en watt and julia iel seem to have coaxed something out of him that allows questions of progression to be shelved for the time being comes in two flavors the sunset mix is the upfront version it pushes his typically fat bass to a place where you can hardly ignore it and iels improvised lyrics are largely shuttled to the backburner in favor of a punishing beat its classic stimming and nothing remarkably special the sunrise mix however is a marvel its dance floor utility is likely slighter than its predecessor but this track isnt so much about dance music as it is about music full stop the four-four beat is incidental iel takes center stage while wild fluttering sounds crackle in the background a small wind section lifts things up when she disappears and an organ offers a bed for all of it its hard to describe what stimming has done here that wasnt captured on his lp from last year its as though hes hollowed out everything and left only the essential (and random and inessential) bits that are required to carry the track to its conclusion maybe watt was behind him urging him to edit things down further and further whatever happened here though itd be nice to hear some more
the second installment in bpitch control s boogy bytes mix series sees kompakt alumnus and bpitch regular releasing his first ever dj mix it s an impressive debut with funke effortlessly taking us from gentle misty-eyed beginnings to a total rave your arms up peak before bringing us back to a sensitive introspective finale all in the space of 73 minutes interestingly funke does not give in to the faddishness that characterises many mixes this is most definitely not plays the minimal hits of 2005 true there are tips of the hat to current favourites: minimal man of the moment sleeparchive pops up as does troy pierce s louderbach project but how often does the always-excellent carsten jost appear on year s best lists how much buzz is there about the always-consistent dial label funke then is clearly much more interested in crafting an involving narrative than hitting all the necessary tracks his technique is an interesting one he favours long mixes slowly and subtly bringing in the next track while you re still grappling with the current one new tracks creep up on you from behind melting almost indistinguishably into the last before taking over as the old track gradually drops away this helps create a strong feeling of cohesion: you feel as if the tracks belong together something that is terribly important for a dj who wants to weave everything into a single narrative furthermore this is no ableton cut-up; funke is definitely old school using decks and vinyl listen carefully on schatrax s mispent years for the telltale crackle and hiss of a needle on vinyl things start off gently with the gorgeous chiming melancholy of efdemin s jean but funke doesn t spend long wrapped a cloak of romantic gloom: by the time zander tv s cut the lines effortlessly slides into isol e s wonderfully off-kilter remix of villalobos what you say is more than i can say funke has firmly established the groove at this point listeners will have trouble stopping themselves from chair-dancing we take a step closer into rave territory with the soaring synths and piano lines of mispent years and then the rave fully kicks in with the 1994 italian smooth remix of transformer 2 s pacific symphony complete with joyously blown whistles a vocal sample repeating love love love and a wonderfully squiggly 303 if you aren t overcome with an urge to throw your arms up into the air and whoop with joy at this point you are fully entitled to return the cd for a refund the rave-up is the obvious peak of the mix (falling exactly halfway through) but from this point on funke keeps things moving nicely with a number of solid minimal tracks such as his own in between days and carsten jost s uccellini funke then gently brings us down with phantom/ghost s exquisitely bittersweet cover of nico s these days neatly bringing us full circle (trainspotters will note that this track is on the same 12 as the efdemin track funke used to kick off the mix full circle indeed) the journey funke takes us on is both satisfying and eventful furthermore it s a solid self-assured dj debut; i had previously only thought of him as a producer but now look forward to hearing more of his work behind the decks
its the irreverence with which uk bass music slams its influences together that makes it vital finesse has nothing to do with it nor does simulation its above all carefree and pleasure-seeking youll find plenty of slicker (expensive) more cerebral (rational) better (back to slicker ) productions than gugus c but find me one that sounds like an elevator jive after a game of beach football with a team of djembe enthusiasts and ill tell you im not having fun the same spirit extends to which although in a more sombre key is just as excitable with clusters of melody popping up all around: quick-fire marimba hits chipper bass neon-sign synth lines and an e-piano bar accompanist the beat imposes a twitch in case you werent already moving feeling decidedly footloose for gugu it seems a shame to append the release with label-head scratcha dv s near-miss wobble the thunder-stealing bass is literally grimey and while it might well tear up londons contraband airwaves as it gatecrashes gugus samba it just seems clumsy

records unleashes its 4th edition of its famous when dead series a collection that showcases some highlight sounds of its impressive label this time they come armed with a host of impressive names and productions including the likes of tiefschwarz john tejeda losoul to name just a few the isol e remix of cardiology is up first beginning the album with a smooth piece of tech that uses a nice bouncy bassline and relaxed vocals the tiefschwarz dub of kinda new by spektrum should be familiar to many while the two lone swordsmen remix of dexter by villalobos is an impressive productions with its delicate guitar riffs and melodic synth patterns you know by losoul is a pretty quirky journey of germen vocal tech-house that has a great flow and darkness to it other impressive moments include the tripped out sounds of klatta by my my as well as the smooth bouncy sounds of john tejada arian leviste with geriatrics max mohr haunts us with the mind warping sounds of old song a production that rolls along nicely due to its crisp percussion and warm pads lindstr m s i feel space is a brilliant highlight to the album thanks to its beautiful bassline tones and melodic atmosphere rework end the album off nicely with the melancholic sounds of think it s too late i must say that there are a few pretty strong productions in this album despite some of them tracks being not too new and thankfully for the dj types all the tracks are unmixed leaving them open for set inclusion and seeing as there are a few great productions here that comes as a blessing
while professional djs tend to keep their video gaming habits off social media i know a few spend their weeknights playing battlefield and nb 2k the unlikely source of the female vocal on the b-side of s latest single is an elf on 2003s warcraft iii one of the worlds best-selling pc games considering was in high school when it came out im not sure how often he still plays but its easy to hear why this particular vocal caught his attention climaxing with a statement id wager hes heard throughout his career: im soooo wasted has been a hit on romanian dance floors for more than a year so its power is established the music is simple enough with a buzzing bassline a squelchy clap and a hive of synth snippets that squiggle and fizz s always with top minimal tracks the breakdowns always seem to end at a perfect moment notching up with energy each time the blunt kick returns the vocal ethereal and weird does the rest of the work the other track is the closest gets to techno this time a hyperactive bassline does most of the damage while another vocal seemingly male and just as strange adds colour never cheesy and always powerful the subtle breakdowns are once again sublime
my philosophy (bounce) sits on a bouncy syncopated beat and bouncy bassline which sounds somewhat close to the southern style hip hop beats from the us courtesy of mr fidget a relatively new producer in the scene donae o mc (another new talent) busts up some quick rhymes imitates a record being scratched and sings for a short section towards the end it s a tune that should get people off their arses and onto the dancefloor pity it s only a one sided vinyl a remix or the instrumental would have rounded off this release quite well
comprised of three members - gavin merfie and froe - the are a new and upcoming breakbeat crew out of west london the boys have already seen releases on dj quests cyberfunk label and have also been heavily involved as studio engineers working on a wide range of styles including urban hip hop house breakbeat and drumnbass dj tayo saw potential in the boys from their earlier releases on cyberfunk and signed two tunes to mob side a kick it designed for peak time floors kick it features a clean breakbeat crisp snares and ravey synth stabs during the introduction the tune gets its title from the scratched up vocals cut up throughout the track after the buildup the synth stabs transform into a catchy synth hook while a monotonic bass line gives the track a much needed testosterone injection theres a lot going on in this tune - lots of acid elements and old skool flavours while the buildups are especially useful for hyping up a crowd side b green light green light on the flip goes on a heavier breaks tip whats noticeable about the fastaz is their use of clean sounding breaks and nice snares this tune features more dark rumbling bass a ravey hook and what sounds like female vocal stabs passed through various effects filters the second phase in the tune brings a little more melody to the bass and electro arpeggio to the track with a massive drum fill to end it off the information sheet states that this is s equivalent of dj traces locust from back in the day mob is one label that encompasses a wide range of breakbeat mainly thanks to tayo having to personally like each tune before they get signed to the label now with this release they can safely say theyve cornered the uplifting party tunes and tear out breaks section
jens kuhns last record workshop 20 was defined by its slowness and its sultriness not that the workshop co-founder has ever been averse to such qualities but given that his latest is equally languid he seems to be defaulting to this mood more and more a producer of kuhns pedigree has nothing further to prove and his music these days is sounding extremely comfortable in its own skin s title track slopes along below 100 bpm its twinkly rhodes chords and denatured percussion never quite mustering a solid groove the title is presumably a reference to the film but theres little sense of daredevil ambition here just a gorgeous downtempo doodle growing ever more charming as it goes a reconstruction of the same track finds its house feet but kuhn leaves acres of space in the arrangement as if the pitter-patter drums and twilit synth chords are only meeting in passing initially offers more direct thrills: its opening groove hints at the clipped funk of kuhns most floor-pleasing productions but before long a melancholic chord progression almost identical to that on workshop 20 s sends us in another direction its hardly a flashy moment but its a deeply satisfying one all the same
press release for ndy meechams fourth album as describes the veteran uk producer as king of the weirdigans but that regal oddness was not always so apparent: meecham whose first recorded output was as a keyboardist for electro-breakbeat project rhythm mode:d enjoyed mainstream success in the early 90s as a member of pop-rave outfit bizarre nc (with dean meredith and carl turner) releasing radio-friendly hits like playing with knives and m gonna get you pparently the long-time synthesizer aficionado didnt enjoy the view from the top of the dance charts by the end of the decade he was working in decidedly more leftfield territory crafting careening punch-drunk rhythms as sir drew and with meredith and stevie kotey chicken lips not to mention his recent work with erol lkan as future four which comes off as a skewed version of old bizarre nc material but its with that meecham lets loose his inner synth-misfit n a recent interview he described his current sound as analog synths/bass guitar malfunction with vocals malfunction might be the key word there: the general aura of is warped electronic funk thats run through the occasional bit of haywire circuitry title track previously released as a hi-nrg-esque cut appears on the album as an altogether different beast a hard-charging piece of demolition equipment its thumps and squalls made human by vocalist michelle bees aggressive apparently improvised cooing meanwhile recalls the sort of post-punk funk that bands like pigbag were doling out in the early 80s dense with hyperdrive percussion that threatens to outrun the rubbery bass and bees musings about triangular voices ts not all tumbling rhythms and fractured arrangements on song like so ma so pops and sparkles with an utterly groovy bassline and percolating keys bouncing atop a deliberately paced disco-tinged breakbeat that tracks vintage roland system 700 synth was programmed by todd terje but a few of the numbers bring to mind another norwegian hans-peter lindstr m particularly his work with vocalist christabelle on 2010s real life no cool meechams to take one example is reminiscent of that albums love sick its humid slo-mo rhythm made even more sultry by bees impassioned murmurs nother occasional point of reference might be johnny jewel produced outfits like chromatics and glass candy (though this record is a bit funkier and loonier) sees bee in icy-cool neo debbie harry mode while meecham provides the glittering bubbling keyboard action but really such comparisons are a bit beside the point: is in a realm of its own one thats a little bit eccentric and a whole lot of fun ts a sound that meechams been honing for two and a half decades and one thats his alone
few could have predicted that whats an electro instrumental released to little fanfare in 2004 would end up on the album of a kanye west collaborator voiced by rising r b star jhene iko but this is just the latest twist in the tale of one of dance musics most pronounced sleeper hits resistance as the track is retitled on hudson mohawkes lantern lp points to the originals traction in glasgow locals like hudmo and jackmaster have been central to its cult success but youll find pockets of adoration for it everywhere the tracks melancholic lead line and slow-burning mood make it suitable for an endless number of contexts even after years of rotation its lost in translation sample ( i just dont know what im sposed to be im stuck es it get easier ) remains as understated and poignant as the track itself from dutch label this reissue is a timely reminder of the tracks brilliance with it are three more cherry-picked from the yamaha discography none of them quite as good the best is beatless and cute; you can imagine it soundtracking a woodland scene in some classic japanese rpg east is pillowy detroit-style techno while the darker is the most pop-friendly moment thanks to a glossy female vocal the producer behind bas bron has had minor chart success in his native netherlands so an overt pop maneuver is hardly out of character still whats simple and endlessly seductive remains his finest achievement

ewan smith posted a snippet of on facebook saying now time for something a little less emo the track isnt a huge departure from some of his earlier work as but its certainly a stark change from his recent full-length for aus the downtempo melancholy there is no right time for his latest 12-inch smith demonstrates a dexterous touch with stripped-back functional club music is all feel-good energy thanks to a softly filtered double bass and loops of a murmuring crowd weighty kicks pounce in a beat late and are promptly joined by dubby stabs completing an elegant palette of textures and frequencies is an alluring no-frills track full of 90s garage sass swung hi-hats jump off the kick while sleazy slow-releasing chords shuffle the similar old-school bass and drum programming of could make it an edit of but its a lot more entrancing sleepy detuned pads rise past swooning vocals with a quiet euphoria making it a boldly emotional contrast to its counterparts
at first rhythm sections label arm appeared strictly local in scope: al dobson jrs rye lane volume one was named for the peckham road on which he lived and on which the rhythm section parties take place n again theres that word international in the labels name a promise on which founder bradley zero has made good with his second original signing for the polite strangers ep zero looks to the opposite side of the globe and to melbourne newcomer as it turns out the distance matters hardly at all: replete with twinkly jazz samples and delicate percussion these four deep house productions doubtless sound right at home on the canavans dance floor that said they arent quite peak-time material their heavy-lidded grooves seem better suited to the closing moments of a party when only the most loved-up remain standing (and only just) bumps languidly along with hiccupy wisps of talkbox vocal drifting woozily out of time so all encompassing is the sense of laziness that its almost not a disappointment when we lose our way in the latter half with its pillow-soft rhodes samples is more focussed and all the better for it is the standout and not only for its abnormally quick pace: trading in dreamy uplift rather than earthbound stumble its the eps most transcendental cut by comparison a beatdown trudge sporting patches of dissonance feels just the wrong side of sluggish
unpredictable they may be but by now you pretty much know what to expect from every six months or so they release two 12-inches at roughly the same time what those records will sound like is anyones guess especially after last years soundtrack for no film vol 2 but you can always count on leftfield mutations of club music from some combination of the labels usual suspects this holds true on their latest two 12-inches both of which came out in april 016 features an untitled track by dresvn (aka label head dynamo dreesen and sued boss svn who also did the records excellent pencil illustrations) and a remix by friend of the family dj sotofett the original is extraordinarily subtle techno: its kick drum and bassline congeal into a thick molasses while a single high frequency sound flickers overhead the whole thing saunters along for a while and eventually falls apart dissolving into a chaotic synth freak-out sotofetts - - -mix does what it says on the tin manhandling s marble textures into a jungle framework it sounds like a rehash of the burridim mix he did of sws reminder last year on sued the demented bird calls hectic drum fills and fake spin-backs he loves so much are all here after an extended break the jungle tropes disappear making room for an uneven backbeat and what sounds like a creepy slowed down chuckle this latter half feels a bit fresher than the jungle bit which is by now well-worn territory for the sex tags mania boss 017 comes from s p posse a collaboration by svn and past guest philip gelberg the pair turn in three angular and intricately composed tribal rhythms all of which patter along at something around 130 bpm the two a-side tracks have an easygoing drum-circle feel; the b-side is more busy and intense with an undulating bass frequency that gives it some techno oomph all three are occasionally brightened up by half-melodies and misty pads but for the most part this record is pure percussion both eps feel slightly safe compared to the rest of s recent catalog but are still elegantly produced and loaded with odd personality
taking their name from one of the greatest underground house tracks of all time the dutch duo of jozef lemmens and pierre van der leeuw have been playing to the heads since first surfacing on yore records early last year merging the prescription records they obviously cherish with an expansiveness that wouldnt be out of place on planet e but their latest release an ep for 20:20 vision sublabel fina finds the group taking a somewhat different tack embracing the most laid-back qualities of their sound for a record that positively sticks to your ribs if of seems to lack the confidence you might expect from its title be patient: a track that begins timidly (and it must be said on a vibe faltydl explored with quite a bit more nuance on his standout track voyager from you stand uncertain ) does eventually get to one of the groups signature big moments and the fact that it sidled there might make it all the more satisfying actually swings harder building slowly but steadily to a suavely euphoric higher plane where this ep finds stretching their legs a bit this sound sits right within cottams pocket so its no surprise that his remix of of utterly owns unexpectedly the low-profile king of slow-mo house kicks the tempo up a few ticks and generally massages the original beyond recognition what were left with is basically just a cottam track which is of course hardly a bad thing
im more a rhythmically interested person moritz von oswald told jordan rothlein in 0 3 im interested in putting things like chords or harmonic elements into rhythms from maurizio to asic channel and rhythm sound von oswald has proven himself one of electronic musics top hypnotists pairing abstract melody with subtle rhythms the same goes for juan tkins who linked up with von oswald in 99 only for their collaboration to go on hiatus for years until it returned as orderland in 0 3 the pairs first release since 0 6s transport album captures the most colourful side of their sound presents two versions of one track is shorter and a touch deeper with a bassline that trudges alongside looped dub chords moving through different stages of decay which almost hits ten minutes feels more organic thanks to warm tape hiss and squiggling synths that sound like bird calls sounds perfect right lmost oth tracks have sections where a loud clap lands on every beat which feels like the dub techno equivalent of yanking the blanket from someone having a late-morning snooze even so theyre minor distractions in otherwise killer loops
the sound design of s debut ep caja negra was impressive it presented four cuts of deft and sinewy techno funk while going beyond the norm to swoop through stranger psychedelic ethers it had a bewitching quality which was especially heard in the tribalist lift which rattled like a snake charmer and stomped and chanted like a hypnotic fireside ritual mother for erlin-based cold wave purveyors shelved the acid in favour of e m grot and industrial gristle the results were just as trippy were treated to more nonconforming techno on the title track is a lengthy meditation in noise vintage drums give it an e m heartbeat but its really about the rest of the clangour surrounding it: didgeridoo drone a swarming mob of bees and the expert modulation of noise is like a combination of earlier tracks lift and gates to where its a mystical decomposing tribal construct that sounds strange and scary nd good too
and his plan b imprint represent the rougher edge of east coast techno and house and his subsidiary label isnt any different here he teams up with for an ep of typically vicious club music s work often sounds like chewed up house but his solo turn has more of an antiseptic sheen that polish is about the only friendly thing about it the song sounds like snd played on sticks instead of chiselled waveforms melody is only implied in the faded framework of the tracks scraping chords the first collaboration with takes those same sounds and liberally applies delay effects for added flavour when a hi hat locks the victorious sounding chord progression in place it begins to feel like a completely different ep strutting its wares with pride gets his own solo spotlight: is another delay heavy boomer one that treads between dub techno and deep house in the same way as levon vincent unlike him theres no subtlety here the bombardment of harshly panned snares is like a cluster bomb the duo ends the ep with a respite at least in this context comforting reverb and gentle percussion define until it turns into a steve reich nightmare with 100 organs all playing discordantly at once its a jarring end to an ep whose hostile production choices are more masochistically satisfying than they are alienating
repetition is a tricky thing how many times can a loop or a sequence tickle your cortex the right way till you either want to switch positions or just scream stop maidstone england producer s new ep offers some examples in the affirmative the a-side does a slow build that undulates nicely albeit quickly; this is a mover there are light congas decorating the groove as well as what sounds like a heavily treated sample of a low saxophone note that floats around every so often theres a little too much bicycle-tire hiss going on intrusive like cranking the house light at peak hour but no one can argue with the repeated vocal snippet house music all night long the flip is a touch headier in its arrangement as a short hard-charging conga loop combined with a woman slowly exhaling in the background quickly becomes the tracks hook as everything surrounding it expands and contracts seems more one-note at first but that loop has a hell of a lot of give to it and it lends itself especially well to the pebbly-percussive breakdown that bolsters the tracks heft
ve never been to mnesia on a monday night but thanks to cocoon mix have an idea about what it might be like f carl craigs half of the latest instalment in the long running series is anything to go by it doesnt sound particularly appealing sonja moonears disc however makes it sound like one of the best parties going both s take different approaches on their efforts for this summers edition of which likely speaks to the breadth of sounds heard at the party behind it for many clubbing in biza is about big records big rooms and big moments which is what craig seems to be going for so some club goers could find this mix rather cheesy despite many of its selections ( ) being on technos classy side whole thing gets right in your face with big chords and a relentless energy sustained by hammering kicks and rapidfire track selection s mixed flawlessly of course with tunes spliced together in a multitude of ways but craigs one dimensional approach seems tailored for impatient listeners tracks themselves arent given room to breathe so otherwise powerful music becomes lost in a mess of melody tough kicks and sub bass moonears half is more restrained but still tougher than what shes likely to play in her club sets outside biza shes one of the sharpest most technical house s out there with a pin point style that injects energy into every transition some top tier techno s she seems in total control of each new element resulting in a steady groove that sparks with every track she serves up s least obvious selections which include older tunes from the late (and much loved) dana kelley steve osullivan and little known celandic producer lean and strong moonears mix is mostly grounded in tough house and tech house but two thirds in tracks by and nthony flirt with full blown techno which feels unnecessary given the time constraints mixs final section is pleasantly sentimental thanks in no small part to lex picones a pumping and melodic tune that somehow captures the feeling of 80s synth pop this instalment of cocoon mix moonear easily steals the show
dario tronchins records over the past few years have painted him as a newcomer still looking for his true identity whether that meant dark droning techno as or scuffed-up house as monday night ( his story has involved a fair bit of soul-searching ) now it seems like tronchin has hit the mark with his second release for the spanish label isnt a complete 180 but it shows the italian producer feeling more comfortable with himself while his earlier releases were sometimes blank-faced this one oozes with personality its the little things that count on theres room to breathe on this record and a warm sound palette thats more immediate than the all-consuming drone of so much dark techno from the opener were submerged in a sumptuous world of texture in which tronchins beats often feel like theyre gliding rather than pounding on the bars culminate in pressurized puffs of air darios meanwhile is a soupy assemblage of squelches and drums that feel like theyre wading through sludge the records more inventive touches dont pull it away from dance floor functionalism entirely with its offbeat accents and rusty percussion is downright funky while the hissy looseness of is irresistible its in moments like these where tronchin truly finds gold on the title track he takes a sudden detour to detroit building an ecosystem of strange synth sounds to stretch out in its not really what we associate with his music which is what makes so engaging
one label that heavily impressed last year was the imprint and they return with a release from veteran secret player mat leutwyler and newcomer jason suzuki the result here is and the label welcomes kosmas epsilon on remix duties first up though is the original mix and yet again this label delivers a fantastic production with this very unique track the production features some beautiful smooth baselines as well as some nice retro melodies and synth patterns that all work together so nicely quality expect more quality on the flip with the very talented kosmas epsilon another baseline driven production from the greek master full of smooth crisp beats and tight melodic patterns that slowly build as the track progresses you know what to expect really from this man and he doesn t disappoint one bit with yet another peak time monster fantastic yet again from kosmas and yet again from this label that continues to innovate with their releases a lot of other labels could learn a thing or two
what do you get when you cross a genre-hopping electronic producer with an ex-member of roll deep no this isnt a joke but the tongue-in-cheek debut from mark pritchard and mc trim might just draw a snigger or two grime seems like the last territory to be touched by the west countryman who has dabbled in everything from ambient electronic (global communication) to spacey hip-hop (harmonic 33) and whatever you might call the back-to-the-future bass duo africa hitech as for trim real name javan st prix the mc has hopped ship from grime landing in dubstep garage and even pop via collaborations with the likes of skream mumdance and riva starr with this in mind the two coming together makes perfect sense though it would have been difficult to anticipate eithers approach in trim delivers all the wit and wordplay that sets him apart from most mcs matched with a bounding hip-hop beat and jovial carnival-esque melody from pritchard his ambiguous message wears a comic mask on the other hand is a crystal clear i dont give a shit to the grime community but where pritchard dominates the relay on here trim prevails and though muted the dancehall underlay proves vital in diluting the grime-narcissism in trims reprisal assisted further by the rappers unusually languid style pritchards instrumental offerings allow for a deeper appreciation of the detail in the production work like the subtle bridge of strings in and the tiers of soundbites that make up however lacking the personality of trim both are just beautifully polished shells he makes this a grime record though not in a stereotypical sense

the first of two honchos reviews the twisted sister of bristol-based label nrk sound division ian pooley shabooms dick johnson (under his magik j guise) combine to bring s definitive summer anthem already huge with the likes of yousef lottie it s the kind of track your arthritic granny would dance around her handbag to with ease smooth looped strings jump over the top of the stripped away guitar licks and percussion with the usual whopping chunky b-line you would expect from pooley a thoroughbred winner
fans were spoilt last year with a run of releases for vlek further and opal tapes that ranked among the righton-based producers finest work shows a further refinement of his method it follows a now-familiar format: a succession of brief sonic images are arranged in a mixtape-like manner at times evolving with a patient logic at others proceeding through unexpected contrasts compared to their predecessors though these tracks show a heightened structural precision the chief protagonist in is the percussion: tom-tom rolls at the opening echoed later in a muffled drum tattoo that plays out under billows of texturing is tied together by a shrill recurring drone around which are woven various pensive string chords piano doodles and sluggish sampled speech the result is a little like the brand of vacated easy listening last explored by the caretaker but johnstone s take on the form is more abstract the pathos is buried deeper too and though it almost escapes in a moment of colour (at t minus two minutes) that piercing drone returns before too long to see us out these tracks are as stringently minimal as anything johnstone has produced lately but the fleeting moments of poignancy make them worthwhile

like many followers of the timeless electro rhythm aka armando martinez imbues his tr- funk with a broad mythos while drexciya processed futurist ideas through their sci-fi backstory martinez looks closer to his miami home for narrative born in miami martinez is the son of immigrants his alias refers to both the anti-regime dissident group alpha 66 and the roland tr-606 drum machine and his music combines - percussion miami bass and detroit electro but even without that context or the knowledge of martinezs study of santeria ritual percussion s debut lp - electronics stands on its own its a varied journey in supple electro imbuing the genres boom-chick with the drama of moonlit escape like underground resistance martinez wants to make radical music you can dance to cuts like are all twitchy funk and spanning pads bringing the expansive early productions of anthony rother to mind slows things down to 113 bpm letting the massive hand-percussion shine amongst the skeletal roland sequences the alternate jam version of is straight-up detroit business: stark minimalism anchored by a splashy snare with the introduction of vocals - electronics reveals its concept: an escape from castros repressive regime uses a talkbox for its chanted chorus: flotation device / get it ready we leave tonight explains their motivation for leaving was our only choice a deep robotic voice intones it all happened when you first oppressed our voice after starting with almost an albums worth of top-notch electro followed by some loose storytelling martinez seems unsure where to go plods along a fairly by-the-numbers jam where for the first time the hand percussion is distracting is little more than a wonky bassline and an electro-acoustic drum melange that feels less novel near the albums end but there are still some surprises the last two tracks possess a brightness that might reflect seeing cuba fade into the distance their pounding low-end is toned down on and the compression turns perfectly interlocking parts into a beautiful mess of optimistic tones these two tracks especially could open the panorama bar blinds but they seem to speak to something larger than an ecstatic night out - electronics is the culmination of martinezs work and its quality is further proof that marginalized voices are among the most vital in a hedonistic world
forget about permaretro this is straight up nostalgia when me was a youth i used to blow my horn like a raver goes the chorus riffing on barrington levys many changes in life from 1980 and if that isnt enough the video features cameo appearances from loads of important folks from in and around the hardcore continuum: i spotted benga goldie and wiley and there are more but that chorus like the song itself is pretty hard to resist if it speaks to any part of your history the beat is less distinctive than it could be but it carries things along fine the songs the thing here more than the track the final quarter when the song bursts into a soca groove is actually my favorite part; what doesnt donaeo sound good on top of nice of shy fx to put out the entire ep for free too and not just the radio edit as you might hope the remixes amplify the songs old-school quality sonically as well as lyrically breakages remix blends a tinny amen iteration with oddly homey cosmic synths and a dubbed out barrington levy sample that evokes kingston much more than london while shys mix is straight up roots reggae mj goes in that direction too but only for a little while; then he brings in the wobble eh pass finally benny takes it out with a d b version that leans harder on a couple of bass notes placed hook-like at the end of each couple of bars
niall mannions vocals on his recent debut album changing days were divisive the sun-kissed melancholy of his earlier productions remained but with the addition of mannions limited croon these remixes based on tracks from the irish producers album suffer from a similar over-reliance on his vocals for emotional impact which isnt helped by the workmanlike efforts of the three contributors tale of rework primitive into a snowfall of chiming accents recalling a nursery rhyme until a serrated bassline make a welcome appearance its structurally similar to dixons remix of youve building in sonority before the introduction of mannions voice at the midway point despite the talkative synth squelches and reverberant percussion in both remixes the long instrumental intros deflate when mannion first enters despite his voice being the intended peak fellow irish producer new fares better draining the melancholy of into a soulful shuffle and processing the repetition of the title over cowbell chintzy synth and a predictable lash of acid its not earth shaking but it has the energy thats totally lacking elsewhere
geoff kirkwood is the previously anonymous berlin-based producer behind who has built admirably on the momentum of his early eps for hivern and correspondant his 12-inch the inaugural release for london label not an animal is another example of the quality-control that comes with kirkwoods prolific versatile work ethic a pair of sterling remixes also add to the impressive record as the name might suggest strongly evokes a slick 80s tv show its goofy bass bump surrounded by raygun fx soft-focus keys and arps s remix of the title track is the standout with a clicky staccato base balanced by beautiful guitar curls and sun-dappled pads has a pleasing undercurrent of rock bombast its agitated bassline and synth features wriggle their way around dramatic crashing percussion the remix finishes the package and it does what youd expect sanding away the originals bumps and spikes to leave a linear slightly psychedelic treat
francis harris a k a seemingly burst out of nowhere in 2005 with a slew of releases on esteemed labels such as dirt crew udiomatique and mule electronic ut the production side of harris came last: hed already been spinning tech house since the early 00s with the likes of mr c and superfreq the version of harris melancholy minimal-tinged obviously came about through extensive time in his rooklyn studio honing a sound a good bit away from his techier roots nice by-product of his efforts the aforementioned slew harris has kept up a busy release schedule with more tracks than he knows what to do with so much so in fact that hes started his own label ( ) as an outlet far from being the menacing twelve that you might expect from the labels name or even the twelve-inchs funnel head sleeve art is an emotional tune built around a sweeping synth line none is more touching than the melodic theme that emerges at the three-minute mark but theres plenty of melancholy to go around nchored by a steady beat and usefully aggravated by skittering insectile buzzing throughout its a warm evocation of fading memories of youth matt (leftroom) and (contexterrior) dont bother with the heartstrings in their remix on the flipside theyre all business speeding up one of the originals synth lines to a breakneck pace and racing towards a climactic siren thatll have you hanging on for dear life in other words a track primed for peaktime

the often mysteriously ny love headed by john creamer stephane k and lance jordan have three singles to its name their label a bit over a year old has quietly built a home for the smooth yet sensual sounds of new york though you wont find many releases forthcoming as other labels those that have been handpicked from the three showcase why the label still continues to be one to watch out for their latest from tripasaurus v blockhead comes in the form of though creamer and k take a break lance jordan (mix) has been on form for all the past releases as the remix producer and with the new single he continues this thread his signature perpetual bass notes digging low never flooding the track creates a good groove to dance to with the male vocalist rasping in the background adds a seductive appeal to the track jordan enhances the track giving it a bit of flare where the album version lacks - sensuality its quite nice nothing for a peak time set but something to play to build a good time out with the jordants beats mix he gives djs a tool something new from ny love maybe theye taking a cue from border community and understanding that djs want more than just the tracks alone but pieces of them so they may utilize them creating new mixes or adding variations to other records to play with unfortunately the tool is just that - a beats tool nothing but the bass kick with some percussion work where you really couldnt see how it could be used around unlike acappellas or melody lines but who knows i may be wrong the final track is the album version from tripasaurus and blockhead pop but its more like adult contemporary pop music laid back with its guitar strings the male vocalist takes center stage a nice bonus to listen to than dance music all the time and it allows anyone who has a copy to compare jordans mix to the original and possibly appreciate the work of the remixer to create and establish a new mood for a record that didnt start as a dance record
the four tracks on s visions ep here have an uncanny way of accumulating detail and depth each one starts off more or less conventionally with an allegiance to house and more mechanoid disco but none of them by its end is anything less than at least twice as busy and rich and robust not much changes in the sauntering slightly laid-back house of for instance yet five minutes later and everything atmospheric is swirling and the beat is throwing punches where it was earlier just landing slaps its opens up a bit and reveals purmans preternatural sense of space with little modularized sounds streaming all over the sound-field and exposing new corners and alcoves as it trances along by things have turned almost kosmische though a warm and insinuating bassline keeps everything moving along the kind of track perfect to drop when one wants to as one often should go deep finishes up with some sharp and fleet analog synth sounds arranged into more buoyant patterns but by then purman has already well-established the fact that he has a vision worth peering into
it seems effortless for to make a good dub record in ten years theres hardly a track that doesnt effectively deliver his take on crisp drums deep basslines and cold vaporous atmospheres but in recent times his functional grooves edge towards something headier and more intense especially on moellers return to after seven years things get more trippy as the producer plays with some of his coarsest textures yet a-side shows moeller in standard mode is dubwise techno at a whisper built on subtle shifts and drums that pound into powder has the same dubby familiarity but is less surprising tightly wound percussion patterns make for a zippy and muscular dj tool b-side goes further out there and to more memorable effect restrained drums of trudge through a windswept and corroded world while slogs around brutal machine sounds as the tracks title suggests that one is all over the place but a heavy hypnotic swing still makes it easy to be absorbed
is the new project from breakspoll 2004s breakthrough producer friendly which sees him team up with vocalist ra khanh the tune started out as a cheeky bootleg that friendly did of le dust suckers mandate my ass which could be heard on his chew the fat at the end cd from 2004 and together the pair reworked the tune and incorporated ras vocal talents on top of it fat records could forsee how big the release would be so they split it the release up into 3 big 12s of which the first two are comprised of the lee coombs remix and the original version original churning in at a slow 120-5 bpms she says features a drawn out panpipish synth hook chugging bassline twangy guitar lick and a rocky house rhythm - certainly nothing youd normally expect from a breaks tune really ra khanh then compliments this with a soulful r b vocal that blends catchy with uplifting lee coombs remix as can be expected from lee his remix blends together the sounds of acid and tribal house with breakbeat production sensibilities kicking off with a high-end percussive rhythm lee progressively adds in percussion elements into the mix and its not long before the massive bass drums come into play with a big electro lick following soon after lee then expertly fits in ras vocals paying careful attention to pitch and drops the pan-pipe synths from the original for good measure for those who dont like the vocals can be treated to the instrumentals however it just doesnt feel the same without it - well who knows what accapellas will get thrown in on top of them
kieran hebden first teased with the release of a track whose title carried some weight it was a soothing balm to a year already beset by tragedy political upheaval and frustration with elegantly trilling strings and a rhythm that recalled hebdens pre-dance floor days at times both melancholy and hopeful is a fusion between s festival-dominating dance music and his more humble beginnings the energy here isnt exactly new nor all that energetic but it is aglow with comfort and compassion hebden established his signature early on in his career infusing electronic sounds with a tactile warmth a style that in the early 000s was sometimes referred to as folktronica with plucked instrumentation and wafting chord sequences the best moments of reflect those older days while reconciling them with hebdens more recent dance floor leanings is a uk garage track with a luxurious breakdown so long you forget youre listening to a dance tune mixes barely-there breaks with synth sweeps that recall selected ambient works dusted off with a plucked music box melody its deep reassuring embrace is hard to resist seems designed to lull and relax its listeners complete with shorter tracks that act like pillowy resting places between the heavier tunes which themselves rarely break above a whisper is one of the lps most euphoric tracks but its also serene the lead arpeggio moves carefully and the hi-hats hiss softly as with much of hebdens recent work though its daintiness can work against it violin samples turn the brief from meek to maudlin and the drowsy trip-hop of sounds like a rough buddha bar demo the albums closer feels like an anticlimactic end lacking the grace and interplay of a similar track there the albums signature string plucks chime and twinkle over the beat as if they were dancing on it is a record whose heart-on-sleeve sentiment occasionally gets the best of it but its tranquil spirit and moments of hope make it almost transgressive at a time when other artists are channeling s climate of fear and frustration into dark angry sounds that alone is a bold statement though far from perfect is one of hebdens most intimate and personal albums with all the idiosyncrasies that come with that

as laura sparrow has quietly become one of vancouvers most respected selectors es crafted a style that sits between cliques in her home city finding a kindred in spirit in the perpetually underrated local dj scott w and throwing trippy afterparties with visual artist nicolas sassoon e plays records that are tougher than the tranquil mood hut jams straighter than her peers and lighter than what the citys techno devotees prefer with sparrow makes the leap into production and her music occupies a space as liminal as her djing her tape for takes influence from the most solemn corners of detroit electro and paints over the familiar parts with brighter colours sparrow has a no-frills all-hardware approach though its far from primitive or grungy e prefers crystal clear tones; her synth leads are as bold and brilliant as finely-wrought jewels built with just a drum machine and one or two other elements her airy tunes leave every sharp corner or round contour open for inspection this sound palette puts all the focus on her melodies which are remarkably tuneful despite sometimes lacking the tension of a more experienced songwriter the austerity of sparrows arrangements paired with her ear for sing-song melody makes for quite a combo the brooding basslines of dont prepare you for the chiming arpeggio that comes bumbling in and on she paints broad affecting strokes with the homey charm of fellow vancouverites fl rist and d tiffany has its darker moments too but theyre never suffocating has an evocative mystery behind its sullen exterior while evokes the exquisite loneliness of tin man is a study of that particular feeling of isolation the sound of one person and their machines in the dark its solitude projected six different ways from the happy-go-lucky to the forlorn a modest album that cycles through only a few sounds during its 28 minutes can feel slight but more than anything it just feels like a debut: shaky in some parts and nearly assured in others in a scene full of laid-back groovers and lo-fi diyers sparrows starkness has an allure all its own
s eponymous label has become a choice outlet for experimental and techno music in sweden (the styles seem to be at a high point at the moment thanks to labels like staycore dr mfakulteten northern electronics and kontra musik ) you might consider the label purely experimental but its first compilation ep is full of club bangers each track is rough and ready favoring distorted low ends and pummelling beats on the a side s has shuffling metallic percussion provides the straightest cut in off beat hi hats boomerang clang snare syncopation and preacher vocals bring it home s own up sounds like it uses the simplest of samples staccato stabs one note bass to create rhythm but the compositional layers and effects are subtly complex it complements s more abstract a gratifying and delirious track with synth spirals and a disintegrating vocal loop its not often that you get a succinct release that feels representative of a particular sound and place the labels move into more clear cut dance floor territory feels natural and full of potential
lthough electronic artists have long raided it for samples genuine brazilian music is something of a niche market outside of south merica itself thats where london based have laid out their stall however; offering not just the wares of brazilian influenced producers like flytronix and mark pritchards troubleman project but also importing new indigenous acts such as sabrina malheiros alongside reissuing rare masterpieces from brazilian legends like and far out boast a back catalogue that has won them many loyal customers not least gilles peterson kenny dope and 4 hero all of whom have mixed editions of the labels brazilika series s with many specialist concerns those compilations could all seem slightly samey if youre not actually an aficionado yourself most people can tell the difference between samba and bossa nova but dilettantes may hear a lot of brazilian music blending into a blur of thundering percussion sultry jazz and tin vocals glorious though it so often is the third brazilika mixed by ndy votel was the exception to that get one and youve got them all rule though subtitled subtropical sunstroke psych out votels contribution took far out on a sharp swerve left into the strange fringes of brazilian rock to unearth old artists who seemingly had as much in common with the oddball psychedelia votel puts out on his finders keepers imprint as they did with the more traditional tin music which is far outs normal stock in trade it was a true journey into uncharted territory in a way so few compilations of any genre really are and its territory that far out delve even deeper into with far out spaced odyssey widening the remit to include jazz folk and electronica from the 70s to the present day this vinyl only compilation serves as an eye opening reminder that theres much more to brazilian music than carnival dancers whooping it up to samba bands in rio de janeiro indeed s or s sound more like the soundtrack to some hippy free festival on the weird hinterlands of folk where tunng reside things then get even weirder still as an unsettling ambient mist envelops s before being blown away by the short space rock storm of s nd although they might be synonymous with the vintage sound of brazil themselves take a ride on this spaceship with the sprawling psychedelic jazz funk groove of and the mellifluous keys and broken beats in s remix of ultimately far out spaced odyssey belongs not to any single country but to a world beyond musical boundaries and most definitely in your collection
quarantine s debut full-length was a hugely accomplished record hailed on this site and many others as one of the best albums of 2012 but the predominance of halos voice proved divisive on her second lp she loses the vocals and lets her machines do the talking it doesnt feel like a wholesale artistic reinvention but it does show halo edging away from the abstract nature of her early records towards something tougher and more immediate maintains the techno trajectory of behind the green door her ep for from earlier this year any fears that this approach has dampened her musics personality are eased by the piano keys and synth droplets on the first track dr a deft composition that leaves you wanting more but the winsome mood is blown out of the water by the woodblock techno of which is busy and cluttered one of those tracks that shouldnt work but really really does it pulses throbs chops and changes the sub-bass wallowing and the percussion smacking on the drums are flattened and dulled so one hit smears over the next as always with halo theres a tactile feel to these productions: you can hear her touch in every subtle tweak the abstract synths that have always marked halos music are still there but theyre welded to a more robust rhythmic framework the title track glues casual neo-classicism to drum machines her current sound in a nutshell a sweeping kick drum-free sketch gives us a chance to take stock seems to play with frequencies on the very edge of human hearing as max d-style synths add warmth to murmurs of bass the album ends where it began as sees halo (presumably) playing piano to a backing of subtle electronic ambience the albums cover art which was drawn by halos father gives the lp an intimate context the image has no direct connection to the music (it was drawn in the 70s before halo was born) but its intricate strange and beautiful much like the album itself
co-founder mr ho has long used his label (and sub-label klasse wrecks) to release his various collaborations and techno permutations all of which have an infectious playfulness to them more often than not hos records include co-owner luca lozano who adds a more serious edge to the music but now he joins austrian producer florian blauensteiner for a second time on where 2013s gratitude ep was a celebration of big bass-driven house music the pairs new 12-inch is more about broken grooves ear-catching fx and dance floor levity both and waste no time establishing their meaty rhythms and rarely take a breather from their mid-120 bpm pulses latter makes wide strides back and forth as it gathers percussive momentum while the former deliriously bounces and skips in place only pausing for a few measures to toy with glittering keys and then drop them entirely its endearing how single-minded ho and blauensteiners tracks are on the b-side sw indulges in the opposite sued label boss plots a winding course for his mix of moving at a jaunty pace through nearly 10 minutes of busy drum patterns and spacey synth work as much as the tune plays like a zoned-out jam session theres just enough structure and arc to keep it from going off the deep end if sw doesnt overshadow his counterparts on the a-side he at least gives them an ideal contrast

theres a certain type of tenderness that shapes a lot of the catalogue whether were talking about the fibrous hum of theo parrishs hand made or the porcelain-coated melodies on telephones the ocean called a loose thread of soft timbres ties these records together that goes some way to explaining why s debut on gerd jansons label is described by janson as music for big rooms wide eyes and small brains that may not sound too flattering but in the spirit of s directness there arent many better ways to explain it the breakbeat mix of has the potency of nostalgia although the same sense of joy is in the original thanks to the arpeggio the two versions share taps into a more recent past its insistent ravey chord progression loosely mimics s 2010 track existence until it takes a hard left into guttural bass stabs and hissing hi-hats is by a shade the deepest thing here but its reese bassline and cascading melody at times as urgent as a fire alarm mean that its just as giddy as the rest

it ll probably be a long time before the clear theme of emerges if one does the moment the only broad trend seems to be a continuation in interest of old school sounds made new in one small microcosm of the dance universe though many artists seem to be of the same mind: an awful lot of techno/dubstep fusion records these days seem to focus on the end of days example shackleton has just released death is not final and peverelist infinity is now on this 12-inch weighs in with one of the first tracks that tries seriously to bridge the gap between dubstep and techno except from the other direction: is a techno track that incorporates aspects of dubstep rather than the other way around (dub/deep techno doesn t count of course being techno made in a dubby rather than specifically dubstep fashion ) s such it s the more unusual of the two sides here leaving out the kick drum in favour of a dubstep style broken beat that wraps itself around two rival basslines it s ten minutes long using only the slightest trace of melody as a counterpoint to the sinewy unfurling of percussion and bass unfortunately the technical virtuosity here isn t put to very good use that aforementioned melody is a tad uninteresting and the track lacks structure s a listener you re hard pressed to predict just how far from the end you are at any given point and there isn t enough tension to make the long listening time feel justified on the flip jonson is more on home turf and more fully in command for the pocalypse uses a more conventional structure introducing itself with a mournful vaguely subcontinental sounding horn which builds slowly to a back-loaded climax of squealing synths that is all intensity in short this tune pretty much does what it says on the tin which is not a paltry accomplishment for something labeled pocalypse

its easy to see why powell is such a fan of both see the past as something to appropriate and fuck with dealing with rave in their own noisy ways and theyre both out to push the boundaries of dance music (founder roc jim nez de cisneros and stephen sharp) joined diagonal at a label night in london in 2014 which was recorded and released as a five-part cassette compilation by reel torque but s proper diagonal debut was last years flapper that a 20-minute-long endurance test that sent a single acid line boinging and squirming into the void their latest is more of the same only slightly longer and much much faster is another exercise in rave synthesis a self-coined concept have been plundering since 2010s rave slime they have produced several eps albums cassettes multimedia pieces and art exhibitions since all from boiled-down techno tropes (such as the hoover) that are reassembled into angular repetitive non-dance floor compositions is a bare-bones record micro-compositional and highly concentrated its designed to bore into your skull numbing it or deeply stimulating it youll find yourself focusing on the minuscule nuanced complexities as they explode into a rollicking squiggle of unpredictability the music is almost functional though thats probably not the point of these tracks
no stranger to the remix on either side of the fence s next contender from his night will last forever lp receives three mixes by two artists an unusual proposition with convincing and differing results superpitchers version smears the original blips and tones into long throbbing pulsars becoming one of his most satisfying recent productions where skipped superpitcher bounds wide-eyed and woozy for nine searing minutes the kompakt pedigree is immediate in the drums and offbeat bassline which could be michael mayer until the chord change comes in and were swooning delightedly in heartbreak s melody is diced and strewn like pixie-dust peppered with delay then left to grow nostalgic while the audience is pounded into a cologne trance reverie after this troy pierces two versions sound flat but once viewed in perspective they reveal their own lesser charms b1s painted by scholars mix is the slightest the low-end transformed into neat pops beside an acid pulse choked into mere gasps the melody resurfaces as tidy pings while the bassline threatens to growl but purrs as snatches of guitar-like feedback sneak by b2 and his black boots remix is similarly petite only funkier: here the tiny particles scatter and weave like villalobos fragments of delay attaching themselves to whatever they can grip halfway through some pads sweep in and almost take charge before a family of woodblocks rattle by aided by tweaked pulses superpitcher has the hands-in-the-air covered but pierce and his black boots will sit nicely in many an early evening set a fine and varied record
on the otherwise impeccably mixed first disc of the rools for rules compilation on bear entertainment instead of a calm beat theres a rushing noise at the end of sankt gorans angel babe the tin man it announces the arrival of the you earthlings a track that stops the mix in its tracks and demands your attention the while of the same cosmic disco ilk sounds murkier and somehow more cosmic as though the tapes have been unearthed from the studio with the dust still firmly attached to the acetate as the novelty of the dr who vibe wears off however the insistent and stately beat takes over and space-y synths deliver an earworm of epic proportions of is similarly off the wall mixing sleigh bells and presumably the titular mermaids chanting in another language over strings and a breezy beat while the b-side evokes moroders chase in its unyielding energy and sighing synth line both have the same aged feel of the and both are fantastic an excellent release

the lads are at it yet again following a set of solid release on electrofly this time they make an appearance on baroque s sister label records and they grace its 20th release with a true 4/4 stormer not only does it come equipped with the original mix of but canadian duo benz md turn on the style on the b-side first up though is the original mix solid from the outset the baseline in this tidy track is very solid and acts as the spine to the most part of this production manipulate some higher end sounds throughout the track creating a bit of a mindwarp throughout and in summation creating a bit of a 5am peak time monster here the flip is not to be taken lightly either as benz md work their magic too creating another progressive peak time stormer a cheeky melodic hook does the business throughout as the beats roll on steadily in its aid atmospheric strings and soundscapes help the track to create a great vibe throughout kindly helped along with a smooth driving baseline fro most part very solid work here from with both sides shining just as bright as each other be warned though this is only for late night use
math rock has always been a genre title as dubious as any but at least it made some literal sense se are complicated proficient rock structures whose clarity and decisiveness belie sophisticated inner workings like their ancestors don caballero and storm stress since their first p in 2004 fit the term to a tee what made the new york supergroup a greater crossover success however was how they translated the music s complications convolutions and contortions into something almost normal ir peak to date 2007 s mirrored didn t just posit math rock s baffling equations it also solved them in terms everyone else could understand ight years later the band has parted ways with singer and founding member tyondai braxton released a collaborative vocal-centric second album and come full circle with the instrumental it s tempting to call the trio s latest a return to form as more than a few of its 12 tracks carry the dna of mirrored and gloss drop but are far too talented and ambitious to double back on themselves ian williams finds new sneaky ways to exploit his ambidextrous synth and guitar performances dave konopka the secret weapon folds his bass guitar and pedalboard into strange shapes john stanier continues to keep true north with his powerhouse drumming still theres a disconnect in and the problem stems from the band both over- and underplaying their strengths best work is a labyrinth of rhythm dynamic melody sound manipulation angular groove harmonic discord and hairpin turns this is on : is a malfunctioning robo-funk roller with adhd and both and carve out spicy dance floor ideas from a glut of micro melodies and rhythmic input latter song in particular recalls the increasing claustrophobia of mirrored s tij or gloss drop s white lectric and holds just enough back to leave room for the listener to enjoy the choreography a song like tips the scales the piece jumps straight into shrill harmonic chaos and slants upwards tracing high-frequency synth whirrs and indistinguishable percussion onto its flat surface noise wouldnt be so unwelcome if it seemed poised to take us anywhere ostentatious stuff sticks out more next to interludes like and which are more or less rudimentary sketches in the context of a album and yet those are often the songs that wrap up all too quickly band have always peppered their records with short tracks like these the brutish yendecker is still the most satisfying example so it says something about that its simplest ideas are also its most interesting maybe thats because if theres such a thing as peak maximalism the band seems dead set on finding it through most of which makes sense: dont release albums so much as unveil science projects demonstrating what unprecedented concoctions theyve devised for us to marvel at in the past this meant theyd hand over a gadget full of esoteric circuitry masterful engineering and kinetic potential this time however its something more functional familiar and safe
is a collaboration from german producers manuel tur and adrian aka urban absolutes of paskal urban absolutes their first record together is uncluttered and excellent with warming deep house structures overlaid by simple beautiful surface ingredients the title track starts on a thick bass roll but only gets going after a rattlesnake snare flourish latin-touched percussion dominates the mix peppering its foreground in the same way high synths do in a number of turs best tracks on the flip is prettier and just as enlivening its low-register piano line is a delight and feels earned once it fully kicks in kuniyukis remix of the track doesnt improve on the gorgeous original while keeping much of the piano and adding some spacey features however his version unfurls into blissful sparky deep house
if theres one thing that characterises - as a dj its his regular presence on the microphone giving his sets a personal human touch much of that is down to his genuinely charismatic nature but it helps that he possesses such a rich and deep speaking voice when it comes to doing vocals on his studio work its this spoken word style that he usually employs to great success the lead single from this years next level album however sees him take a shot at singing instead those of you whove heard sex rain from his debut album carnival house will already know that singing isnt exactly eds forte like that particular track the vocal on im comin suffers from bouts of flatness even distorting the audio at points but beneath it is a solid deep house production that ticks plenty of the right boxes as far as melody and groove are concerned that said there is a certain fragility to the delivery that some will view as a positive quality but you get the feeling that splicing together multiple vocal takes would have made it great rather than just good thankfully the release is rescued on the flip with two strong remixes from levon and aybee goes for more of a dance floor-focused vibe on his version spacing things out with deep reverberated synth tones and a strong shuffling groove before deploying a stridently rolling piano riff however its oakland resident and deepblak boss aybee that provides the highlight of the package building things up with a series of delicately whooshing chords before reintroducing the rugged melodic bassline from earlier in the track

jack haighton recently described s curious musical persona on greatest hits : tipsily debonair like a rocky horror tim curry without the limp wrist yet the steady quality of their work over the past three years is almost the opposite of that appeal the ep makes it easy to hear both the stability their work rate suggests and the off-kilter quality that makes them unique the title track is a case in point moving easily between fairly mellifluous tech house and something earthier thanks to the gravelly vocal and the guttural woodwind accompanying that accompanies it handing it off to matthew herbert was an easy call he too loves to marry grubby leftfield timbres to strict four-on-the-floor thump the steadier the pace the more surprises you can throw on top his remix of is the most careening work hes done in a while giving off the feeling that hes trying a little of everything and feels like a practice run for something more focused s fellow man seuils dub meanwhile couldnt be more straightforward the beat is slowed a touch a funky guitar lick is gently filtered the hi-hats get their turn in the sun and the bass growls invitingly it isnt tipsy just debonair
disco has come a long way in the last forty years and never could that be more obvious than when listening to japanese duo kz and kent has honed their own grown up slow release style to perfection over the last decade both as s and producers they favour a steady and studied incline as is very much the case on their tantric new mix d for mule sub label charm here is in the chase: right from the f theres an inherent sense climax that never really comes (in a good way) records are seamlessly blended and sequenced throughout with each one building on what went before for instance the way the beachy guitar trills s make way for gummy beats and more prominent strums passage records doused in bright colours and ringing harmonics from the likes lone and seem to have you craning upwards as if youre at the centre a radiant glow about to be beamed up into the cosmos during the italo dazzles 80 by youre so high you wonder where things can go in the second half but the pair respond knowingly stripping things back to a chugging kick drum and more sombre mood just when they needed to nd then they re build once again first with funk bass then the high rise and fall a heavy kick and onto the thickly plucked riff which sounds as good dubbed by as it did in original form on ndrew weatheralls recent masterpiece t this point kz and rent have piloted quite the trip and as such lovingly coax you down through grooves like ears and oby obiass humid remix me smart and sophisticated this mix is a more lasting experience than a flash pan pleasure
some noticeable trends have trickled through s output these past couple of years one is the drum programming which is robust but never overbearing this is partly down to the influence of label founder lovefingers real name ndrew hogge he spent much of his youth drumming in various bands and admits hes picky about kicks and snares res also a shared sense of melody one thats lodged somewhere between playful and bittersweet synths channeling marimbas and steel drums usually do the trick: take the extravagant switch-up five minutes into tambiens 2014 tune re you in touch w/ varan or the more gentle ascension of powders humid wind or basically everything on young marcos iology album melodic instrument of choice on s latest 12-inch s is the kalimba a type of a thumb piano from frica it provides an incredibly pretty introduction to the eps standout moment rest of the track grows around it like ivy with a synth arpeggio eventually overpowering the kalimba -side takes longer to reveal itself relax relax feel it against the backs of your legs says a sampled voice whose arrival cues the track to gently burst into life will powers -style meditation/self-help vocal has been done before in dance music not least by tornado wallace on his 2013 thinking llowed ep for and it sounds decent here but the track doesnt equal the charm of

as reaches its 50 milestone the label is turning up the heat with and his pathwork ep part of the ever impressive tigerhook corp randall turns in two solid productions in the first disc of this release tonite featuring ursula rucker is on the a-side and it begins with some clean and crisp drums that is shortly followed by a smooth and subtle baseline accompanied by some delicate whispers by ursula the full vocal shortly appear in a subtle subdued fashion while quirky effects give the production a catchy hook all in all it s a deep yet strangely enticing track the bitter truth starts off with a positive announcement before the beats kick in unleashing a smooth drum pattern and eerie atmospheric effects the track ebbs and flows for a few moments until a deep base haunts the airwaves while filtered and distorted vocal wails float in and out a clever and haunting production this one the tonite accapella follows with short vocal snippets from the a-side track all in all pretty solid productions and what you would expect from a member of such a pool of talent such as the tigerhook crew
and the smattering of associates who have featured on his label fachwerk take techno seriously but not too seriously: theirs is a techno thats fun reduced to be certain but never at the expense of a certain playfulness about the way they put sounds together the aptly titled fachwerk ep brings together the aforementioned with partners in crime and for four berghain ready tracks that are neither utterly mindblowing nor easy to brush aside anchored by a sample that shouts at you in as good natured a way as possible s actually seems to cheer you on in your dancing rather than just pound some moves out of you he collaborates with on which begins simply enough hats big kick a warped sample before some unexpected bass squelches in leaving you disoriented but plowing ever onward s also plays with our expectations though it takes the opposite tack: it opens with a heavy grind but some ur ready chords quickly swoop in and lighten the load considerably s contribution the percussion exercise is the collections most staid inclusion; you may find that the title is about all you can say about it regardless the ep is still on the whole worth your time especially if its been awhile since you visited their twisted take on capital t techno
three tracks from s latest album from heart its a start a work art were taken from one of five scratchy acetates cut in 000 that a worn-out dubplate could be the foundation of a new atobe full-length is proof of the demand for the producers music and perhaps the esteem with which hes held in recent years the artist has been written into the dub techno canon as one of the genres finest producers thanks to releases like 0 4s butterfly effect more atobe music has trickled out since then including another album world and a -inch from heart its a start a work art is another record of stellar quality from the elusive artist atobes arrangements changing at just the right moments while barely changing at all are what makes his techno outstanding shares trademarks a patient drum pattern a haunting chord progression a muted sound palette with some of atobes best work once atobe introduces an extra synth lead and at one point a brief piano motif on they catch your ear without interrupting the tracks patient flow rest of from heart its a start a work art seems like a scattershot selection of atobes work tracks from the acetate are more straightforward versions of the subaquatic dub techno of his chain reaction -inch ship-scope re are two beatless interludes and that home in on atobes idiosyncratic sense of texture and melody with the eerie yearning quality of his best work present in even these reduced morsels demdike stare have unearthed a remarkable amount of music from an artist who until three years ago had released a solitary -inch from heart its a start a work art s patchwork sequencing and the sources of the tracks themselves suggests that there may not be much more to find its the least cohesive of the three atobe lps that has released so far but atobes talent is so strong that it hardly matters in fidelity mood and style the album varies a great deal across its 40 minutes but the quality throughout is astoundingly high
londons label got off to one hell of a start last year opening with the one-two punch of definition-skirting zeitgeisty meanderings from adr and no ufos the label took a hard left with electronics without tears an essential collection of foundational electronic music from radiophonic pioneer frederick judd its something of a dangerous proposition to pair classic with contemporary but the labels mission statement of sorts 1950-tomorrow new-archive light-dark is a fascinating one in this retro-maniacal youtube-addled moment bristols nick edwards aka has been the embodiment of this attitude for the last few years releasing music on labels as diverse as further perc trax and punch drunk that sound both vintage and crispy-fresh (and surprisingly label-appropriate) his debut the ep continues this journey: whether caught in a thick drone or on a minimalist musique concrete tangent s latest is as outside of time as it is right in the moment on opener mill we get something surprisingly songlike zaps and delay lines dancing around a sluggish but straightforwardly post-punk bassline as residual gurgles subside enters with a moan of a melody and panning dubbed out squelches that evoke the sort of seasickness you might experience on a ghost ship after the cartoon-like interlude we get the noisily loping jugglin the collections most minimalist and perhaps catchy inclusion meanwhile has a ghostly melody schoenberg might have dreamed up had he spent his days noodling on a bass guitar in his parents suburban garage it makes for an awesomely creepy ending to an ep youre not likely to shake off anytime soon
whether or not manchester duo are interested in remaining enigmatic is besides the point: theyve given themselves an almost defiantly un-googleable name thankfully their music scattered across labels like horizontal ground idle hands black sun and their own imprint speaks perfectly well for itself the three untitled tracks on this second self-released 12-inch offer plenty of soot-blackened techno thrills in line with some of percs more unrelenting recent music (a new brutality springs to mind) lower in fidelity and less fluid than british forebears such as regis and surgeon but lacking the willfully murky approach of karenn or blawan they occupy a particularly hard-nosed and brittle space industrial gets thrown around a lot to describe the newer crop of dark british techno artists but in terms of their sound palette justify it more than most these tracks chug like steam trains grimly monolithic and pumping out choking clouds of grubby muck the jagged melodies of pound up and down like pistons s surface has arcs of raw electricity that seem to spit and crackle from exposed cables; theyre drawn along by thick woody kicks and the sawing welding and hammering sounds of heavy factory work
along with paradox finlands janne hatula is best known as one of the prime purveyors of drumfunk a style of drum bass known for its virtuosic chopping of breaks a trait that now sounds dated to many ears after publicly announcing his retirement due to frustration with the music industry is back with a new ep and a slinkier sense of drum programming though its at drum bass tempo the half-stepping lurch of makes every drum hit feel pounding and precise the drums are big metallic and far removed from the jazzy touches of his past work they keep a curious slightly broken orbit around the bassline while careful synth work and vocal snippets give it a claustrophobic feel an industrial makeover for s usually limber beats has a similar vibe but with an orientalist twist: the rolling tabla-like percussion is nice until the vocal sample pushes it over the edge into uncomfortable cultural pastiche its a solid if slightly clumsy counterpart to the much superior flipside
real name bas bron is a master of melody his strange but soothing synth work left its mark on 2015 with whats a girl to do imaginary lines and an excellent split ep with young marco each release imbued with rosy hues and electro crispness became a vinyl collectors gem the dutch producer returns with his first record in two years released on the ep presents a bolder more fleshed-out version of brons sound each track is strewn with melody but theres less melancholy than usual s title track is anthemic a departure from imaginary lines an lp that according to angus finlayson didnt overstate its case burly drums sky-high synths and cascading breakdowns combine for brons biggest-sounding tune so far with its downcast atmosphere is closer to what were used to but its free-jamming lead and funky bassline seem more extroverted than before starts with chunky piano riffs and picks up colorful spurts of synth before ending in a pool of soft glowing pads like brons best work it charms the longer it goes on
steffi has unveiled her new label seemingly at the exact right time deep house is all the rage again people are in love with limited edition vinyl and when you throw the words panorama bar on the one-sheet its almost a buy-on-sight situation dresden resident whose tracks are regularly played by the panorama bar residents especially steffi and tama sumo was a perfect fit for the upstart imprint his infectious druggy-morning sound is perfect for the delicate selectors that fawn over short-run vinyl-only releases the a-side of the release delivers two versions of the title track and in a bold move leads the side off with the remix by basic the original slowly lurches to life with a patiently evolving heavily filtered set of pipe organs all while the shoulder-shaking jerk to the percussion and resonant low-end come together to produce an original and masterfully crafted track the remix is the equivalent of a screwed-and-chopped version of a hip-hop track bsu does a brilliant job of providing an almost indecipherable edit and its an absolute monster on a big sound system crisp boomy and layered in all the right places proper applause should be awarded to the canadian for properly executing the remix to such a complex track rounding out the ep sadly feels like an afterthought compared to the entirety of the flip far more palatable in production than the title cut and its remix is a polite uplifting house track that would sound more at home on plastic city or freerange in no way is it a bad track and more than likely it will find its way in to dj sets more often than its partners on the wax but it in some way sticks out more in an undesirable way in relation to the grime of the ancillary productions
marks s return to releasing his own material after a seemingly endless string of prime cut remixes his dusky remix of mari oines vuoi vuoi mu his dark and dubby remix of ooka shades vertigo and his crackling revision of kraak smaaks no sun in the sky are all recent evidence that schwarz is a master of getting unexpected and inspiring results from other peoples material his latest twelve however finds him remixing himself offering a final draft of one of his own tunes from (included here in its original form) the soul of is an aural apparition: a backwards tape edit which will raise the hairs on the back of your neck this ghostly refrain is punctuated by a fiercely plucked bassline delicate pads and mourning string swells which pass by like a car on a highway it all adds up to a haunting and elegant deep house experience s with many schwarz productions is meticulously constructed from choice timbres but in its more muscular form its solid enough to move more deeply-inclined dancefloors i could even imagine carl craig capping off one of his sets with the tune if he was feeling particularly intrepid (or had run out of his own productions) the blueprint for the track appears on the -side in a skeletal form side from the relative sparseness a pleasant yet ill-fitting chime intro is the most noticeable difference between the versions ut when compared with the -side s wispy execution seems somehow lacking: you can hear why schwarz returned for another crack at it unlike his reinterpretations of jimis and leave my head lone rain from last year this is less a variation in the jazz sense than a rough draft needing to be fleshed out still im glad it was included: schwarzs tendency towards releasing versions is a great opportunity for new fans to look back at his earlier work may have flown under the radar after its march release perhaps because relatively few djs were able to integrate such a complicated and musical track into their sets but that doesnt diminish its standing as one of s best tracks and a high point for himself
ryan hemsworth has made a career of being shy those qualities made his earliest music stand out he took ideas from hip-hop trap and downtempo electronica and painted them in gentle brushstrokes but as he gained popularity and signed with canadian indie giant last gang his music grew glossier and crossover-friendly with guest spots from artists like r b singer tinashe last year the toronto producer turned his ear back towards the underdogs with an outlet for near-unknowns who make hemsworths kind of childlike music racked up over 20 releases in a year but hemsworth himself had yet to appear on the label his debut is also his first major release since last years emo-influenced alone for the first time lp its a collaboration with seattle producer lucas and though its hard to say exactly what the outsider adds the music they make together looks to the early days of last words the scruffy synths and plaintive guitar strums on the ep feels like going back to basics the track is among hemsworths prettiest built around a single vocal gasp some sound fx in the background and not much more the drums are surprisingly rough which gives the ep a homemade feel the dreamy time is the work of a rap fan raised on dntel its knocking boom-bap beat is cushioned by comforting synths bird sounds and guitar while feels folky with rustic strings and mumbled vocals on the duo pair tender cello with brainfeeder-esque found-sound percussion is a hip-hop lullaby with lazy ambling percussion most of taps into hemsworths past but highlight negotiates his present with a big sweeping melody and svelte synth textures it stands out on an ep that otherwise feels like a comfy sweater
tenth release from the aussie digital label is the debut from cristovao mestre aka kicking off the ep is seven sins though it takes a bit to get going it s a nocturnal beauty that s as deep as the pacific ocean working with a floaty-bass kick and minimal vocals the track built for the club nothing crashing or high-energy for peak time instead seven sins lays out a calm house beat to make people groove along from left to right with their ears intact deep electro contact continues the trend for more earthly and more atmospheric sounds with a deepening of glitch for good measure and techno synths slowed to a halt you d think you had already taken one too many drinks before the track even got started dec is between tech-house and techno like half-techno; it s not minimal enough to be minimal but not hard enough to be techno final track for the three-cut ep is tornado man a plumpeduptechjoint that s as acidly as you can go these days trancey strings with an electronmatic vibe that s all four-to-the-floor carrying a beat that latterly tries to beat your senses into a bowl of jelly it s techno for tech heads
tony williams debut album earlier this year showed him slowing his frenetic footwork down a bit a formula that worked as often as it didnt he returns half a year later with a four-tracker that sounds like it was birthed from the same sessions but mostly lacking transistor rhythm s growing pains might just be the biggest track yet on the surface its another cookie-cutter exercise repeated vocal sample simmering organs horn stabs but everything lands with such gracefully flowing force its like a mushroom cloud rendered in wispy vapour trails t uh really goes boom everything else on adventures in rainbow country is inflated to the same monolithic scale classic ghettotech and electro turned into a caricature the constantly descending synths of wouldnt sound out of place on mad decent and the whimsical has taunting arpeggios that spiral like video game jingles from those descriptions these tracks should sound downright silly but theyre presented with unusual and unwavering pulverizing force the odd one out on the ep is which never quite congeals into more than the sum of its parts luckily for him the other three are his most seamless frankenstein jobs yet
this second edits comp from paris dirty crew affirms that for pilooski and friends everything old is still new again unlike many re-editors though the dirty team doesnt limit itself to re-cutting gems from the fertile underground of dusty disco and the breadth of material on 2 shows just how wide theyre capable of casting their net should this comp make its way into your hands consider yourself well-armed: the next time you play host you wont have to show off with a cultivated playlist simply let this thing roll from start to finish as it represents a range of people-pleasers that dont resort to the lowest common denominator never a mean feat while pilooski and the dirty crew are adept at wielding the edit knife the opening track is solid evidence that they also know when to leave well enough alone not a paw has been laid on the haunting far-forgotten folk-funk tune glastonbury it opens with an incantatory druid melody that suddenly sprouts a deeply funky drum backing a brazen genre-bend that sounds like james brown doing the wicker man if the track didnt have the word reissue stamped on it youd be forgiven for thinking it a mash-up its fascinating hybrid form is a precursor to the past-present re-edits time warp that gets fully inaugurated once a loud 808 thump suddenly materializes beneath the deep bayou groove of elvis presleys crawfish lyrics-wise the image of procuring such a creature from its muddy shelter and then preparing it for dinner doesnt seem terribly different from the process of digging up a bunch of lost sonic delights and dicing them up for todays palettes here the recipe seems to involve sprinkles of lightly descending phaseshift and shining loops of harp glissando later pilooski cohort joakim cuts j j cales ride my high into enough of a dreamy up-tempo breezer that you can see how psych-rockers like spiritualized once got so blissed out on the blues having pulled off a similar transformation of j j s they call me the breeze way back on lazer guided melodies while the compilations second half delves into the 80s with a steady medley of electro-infused tunes the kind of slower-speed oddities that seem to indicate that in dance music its kind of hard to be weird and fast at the same time one of pilooskis greatest talents is his remarkable ability to let a track build steam his edits often chug churn and throb forward like an approaching freight train yellow powers hai samurai is a particularly striking example of this a dense 80s electro-disco tune that slowly and steadily grows in pulsing intensity pilooskis take on the thes giant however does more or less the opposite taking a stripped-down approach to a synth-pop groove thats allowed to ride out unperturbed before climaxing in a syncopated drum burst and then in a bit of fresh air after a long spell of deep and wonky weirdness the final track brings us back to a final fresh-faced soul-stomp an edit of del shannons gemini along with crawfish its one of the standouts here marrying a lovely minor-key ditty to a powerful gary-glitter-style stadium shuffle a joyous curtain-closer
it takes all of about three seconds for s 1990 classic to reveal itself for what it is: a sumptuously mechanistic and enduringly soulful piece of etroit techno of the kind that has helped make etroit techno mean what it means today among its many impressive attributes is the way it moves less by way of momentum than by way of mood the pace changes significantly through a few distinct fits and starts and rarer still the whole track sounds as if it has strangely started to think about itself as it cycles through different stages of contemplation and release comes here in a release split into two parts in martin onds original 1990 version and an 1991 version that is more roughly hewn dreamy and atmospheric quite different really others on the docket sharing remastering by redshape include s in which bounds by with a heavily arpeggiated billow and john carpenter-like keyboard and a markedly distinctive blend of murky tribal banging constricted and reduced into something completely singular follows with a funkily blipped-out sense of euphoria and goes comparatively spacious as the result of a collaboration between onds and fellow etroiter anthony shake shakir theres an incredible amount of range covered here all of it somehow suffused with the same sense of place
whoops somethings got john and justins back up whats eating the usually reserved pair oh just the usual stuff household bills the daily grind techno losing its flippin focus that sort of thing the pr blurb that accompanies this four-tracker is laced with barely concealed aggression: rallying against the soft bubbly trance-like mutations (boo ) prevalent in much of todays sounds their mission statement is direct and noble: to make 90s techno die-hards proud (yay ) to that end theyve kept things simple - each of the four analogue attacks are constructed from the bare minimum using the bare minimum the wonderful sets the stall out the acerbic kick thudding toms and wonderfully loose heavy hats stand guard while a modulating raw synth causes trouble the pairs trademark swing is present but the real beauty is in their control of the elements: knowing when its correct to add and when to subtract is simpler and harsher: a violent fx-heavy wibble weaves through until the jackhammer 808s take it up a notch the oscillating warped bass riff that runs through dancefloor winner is both filthy and funky complemented by bleeps that recall the pairs incendiary mind bend and again some choice razor-sharp percussion closer with its buzzing frequencies bubbling bloops and free-for-all fx - lacks the clarity and focus of the previous three their mission to start technos equivalent of a flat earth society to rid the world of digital dross may be doomed from the outset but this is a damn convincing clarion call
when was announced as the first ep on new texas label southern belle it was just another step on the path of rashad hardens unstoppable ascent but now released shortly after his sudden and tragic death takes on enormous significance as the footwork pioneers first posthumous release like all of hardens music theres an air of excitement about that makes it almost painful to listen to in the wake of his passing four tracks are slightly cruder than the smooth soul he mastered on last years uble cup needling bassline of the title track is especially harsh and once the rotating cast of talking head samples gets to the promethazine section it feels suffocating of course harden who told me only months ago that every day has been dope for [him] wouldnt want us to feel sad when listening to his music and with these classic-style teklife bangers theres no reason to collaboration girl is a foul-mouthed ghettotech jam full of pop that pussy screams joins them for the near-schizo which goes from chipmunk soul to barking juicy j samples but its s you a collaboration with - that chops up chaka khans 984 smash i feel for you thatll really break your heart if you let it playful drum programming turns the sax jittery and the frantic rush of vocal hooks over the next four minutes is rashad at his most triumphant harden always had a way of turning footworks sonic assault into something propulsive and encouraging s hard to imagine a better send-off for such a talented artist than a perfectly executed cut-up of a classic and its equally as difficult to think of anyone doing it better than him
its easy enough to think of as synonymous with pacou doubt the label founders sonorous chords and thunderous kicks have knocked more than a few out of the park for the venerable publishing house but id argue that the labels particular take on detroit is most exciting when the visitors are at bat the latest guest to step to the plate is pittsburghs opening track capitalizes on the sort of cavernous depths and chrome finish you expect from one of pacous dubbier tracks or maybe mike huckaby (himself a cache alum) rudiman traps his broken chords under a canopy of tangled textured percussion and then soaks everything in delay the dense sound design is familiar but theres something particularly humid about it this time and as i catch myself thinking that ive just heard howling wind and a distant animal cry im reminded of just how enveloping and organic techno can sometimes be but immersive environments arent the only things on rudimans agenda has a similar density and depth but its emphasis is more on searing acid grooves to catch that though youll first have to break through the frenzied neon streaks of pitch shifted synths darting across the tracks surface in much the same way they do in derrick mays icon switches to an emotive deep techno palette of excellent vintage and its no less generous with melody lmost placid at the beginning its gusts of synthetic strings and gently cascading keyboards are barely anchored by echoing handclaps but then comes the overheated g ttsching styled strumming to add an electro urgency that really gets the track surging t too tough really to see where all this classic techno craftsmanship fits into pacous idea of techno
has a long history of swimming the darkest of the trippy techno waters with her own fullpanda imprint but she finally stepped outside her own insular world back in 2010 with the strong sonic state ep on dam xs label that release was well-timed with a resurgence of heady industrial-influenced techno and at the end of last year she followed it up with an even better effort for in some ways feels like a more straightforward techno missive than sonic state lacking the structural detours of the latters b-side but its no less challenging or indeed impressive begins with throbbing and distant clanging a smokescreened industrial landscape quickly cluttered by a raw chord sequence and a dizzily disorienting motion-sick hi-hat pattern and the whole thing gets submerged in blurry filters instead of a proper breakdown listen distractedly and its your average dark techno banger; listen with a more discerning ear and its a smudged impressionist canvas toying with the stereo spectrum in a similar way the bits and pieces of seem to ghost in and out randomly from the fog of machinery that blankets the tracks nether-regions while pulls no punches sending a straightforward techno track through a shifting wormhole of dissonant chords and shifting textures
four years after their debut release background information on berlin house trio is still scarce but their stock-in-trade is by now common knowledge bumping uncomplicated hardware-created tools are the order of the day and each of the three cuts here excel under these parameters as with their seven previous eps is presented with minimal packaging and no track titles the a-side is little more than an elasticated bass drum claps and hats and a repeating green velvet-ish vocal loop but it works superbly the s primary selling point is its skittering metallic key pattern which conjures a mildly introspective take on jeff mills the bells ominous bass groans and the odd distorted vocal snippet complete the brew the projects a gurning acid-tinged bassline onto a stark percussive framework closing another ep thats low on flab
in the past the zenker brothers label has dabbled with compilations but the series would appear to signify a stronger commitment to the format on the a side this first one features two of the labels previous signings plus two new ones on the flip leads off with a delicate slice of dub which recalls voices from the lakes recent album in the way it pulsates organically throughout a tiny metronomic clanking sets up the mood supported only by minute changes elsewhere when big things do happen the introduction of a cymbal or rippling dub chords for instance the impact seems profound from a fledgling serb by the name of isnt so subtle it does however impress with its command of melody like placid waves its blunt chords rise and fall with a beautiful rhythmic intensity on the other side gives off the impression that hes been hanging out with fellow argentinian jonas kopp another of s artists his big flabby kicks and caustic hats are exactly like those kopp favours the similarities end there however where kopps work is mostly dark is lacquered with glistening strings and a cheerful synthesised whistle its warm and inviting despite the pounding underside last s solidifies the vague detroit influence running through the rest of the record its archetypal loop techno featuring a rapid and constantly rising organ sequence spooled out over shunting hats and claps
earlier this year dj metatrons 2 the sky sold out with the speed of a stadium tour with one fan commenting that they had literally pulled over on the side of the highway driving home to buy [the] record this says a lot about today once something intimate its now an institution continuing to widen the reach of its melancholic sound not only has the label upped its number of releases and sub-labels it now also features artists outside of the core crew first came the huerco s remixes for olins from iceland and now its which hands s 2014 lp over to lawrence losoul ezekiel and mainstay vril the eps first and last tracks rework album closer while the original piano ballad evokes quiet scenes of dusk lawrence crafts a shadowy house groover for the deepest part of the night ezekiel known for his abstract electro-acoustic compositions stays closer to the source materials delicacy lulled keys are still the focus though here theyre broken up like snapped branches and paired with dusty snubbed percussion losouls take on is a stripped and muscular pumper its stark groove still in the clutches of the originals hypnotic gloom on vrils extended version of he obscures its striking crystalline patterns with a dubby techno fog no track on outdoes the originals but the overall richness of styles has a draw of its own
this second release on berlin label kasette is from newcomer and judging by his original is the on the thats an accurate moniker this is messy stuff res simply too much going on for much groove to grow here - it sounds like somebody downloaded one too many soft synths and couldnt leave it alone gets it more right on which is less ket mess and more stand-up-and-dance more lucid if you like re is still an ad hoc feeling to it but its definitely quite playable is the also gets two remixes the first from phage is marco resmann from pan-pot and luna city express) whose recent plumbers workshop on klang was proper fourth gear dance music ir remix doesnt quite forget the elasticity of the original but thankfully it straightens the creases out of the track not bad but with so many labels releasing tracks it s hard to stand head and shoulders above isnt it second remix is a collab between mikdat and which is very good minimizing the circo loco samples and maximizing the groove of the track here the vocals the pads the shake ups and the break downs sit in the right order bravo hombres all of the tracks come firmly stamped as techno with an experimental edge re is definitely a certain crowd who would love this record all day long but i myself am inclined towards a little more soul and sugar still the is definitely worth a listen
credit is due to mark fell and for luring errorsmith out of his studio retirement well semi-retirement: in the past half-decade erik wiegand has issued a handful of singles as half of mmm keeping alive the ravey spirit of the duos 97 hit donna the mmm material indulges wiegands peak-time impulses; his thorny computer-music side showcased brilliantly on his long-dormant solo project hasnt been so evident this collaborative release revives it though not in a way weve quite seen before in terms of a middle ground between the two producers falls a little closer to fells tantric beat work-outs than wiegands wilder excesses the tone is colourful but ambiguous the structures slow-moving lengthy a-side cut grips onto an asymmetrical groove and doesnt let go its hard to tell whether the results are meditative or uncomfortably tense partway through falsetto voices sing harmonies low in the mix a strangely human touch in the robotic setting these voices (wiegands maybe) return on the rhythmically straighter this time processed so they slide nauseatingly off-pitch the effect is jarring but still oddly cheerful on 80 the pair fire off a bewildering salvo of metallic concussions feels slight compared to other projects from its creators but that doesnt make it any less fascinating
you could tell me this was a long-awaited reissue i wouldnt raise an eyebrow as timely as the title track sounds steely but sweaty techno with dubby inflections its got a tribal surge that feels closer to the mid-90s (which may be because its the new record from a steadily prolific veteran with about fifteen years under his belt whose early career was tightly intertwined with artists like the black dog baby ford ) the pounding techno of isnt too distant from s well districts rumbling stabs industrial rhythms or modern loves dubbier releases the difference is that theres no interest here in paring down the strobe-lit hedonism moreso it reminds of some of basic channels early tracks or to look in a different direction jeff mills steers nearer to tresor in feel with a rubbery wobble of bass some sci-fi contrails regular subwoofer depth charges to help novices locate the club from around the corner its a potent couple of tunes fully satisfying an appetite for deep muscular techno but offering something quite distinct from the tropes tendencies of recent dub techno the second side runs at a far less driving pace both pair restrained house beats with airy synths the vangelis- -a-rhythm-track atmospherics are certainly familiar but all the same its bright future-romantic ambience conveys an awe thats quite contagious in any event its a deep breath at sunrise after the first sides fevered race through gotham
still music has commanded worthy attention after rick wilhites nalogue quarium its smaller sublabel stillove4music has no definitive musical mandate but excellent releases are as good a genre as any nd thats exactly what provide on this excursion in various types of house its easy figure that out by the title track which makes use of a vocal sample that chants the mantra goin 2 over a stabbing synth line and echoed claps somethings makes use of soul vocal elements a nice contrast its more repetitive a-side sibling and though the four- -the-floor never falters a flowing funk breakdown wards the end is expertly pulled back gether the last leg of the journey is a slow powerful deep house track a nod wards mr fingers juno 60 the ep is a very polished production and if anything this may be its greatest flaw ny rawer however and may have strayed in murky nostalgia
when it comes to label showcase albums things don t get much more interesting then bedrock s layered sounds the 2nd installment of the series arrives at a time when bedrock the label is at perhaps its most exciting time with artists such as terry grant weird continental types pole folder luke fair and many others all delivering must buy releases what bedrock also does well here is deliver a double album that features many unreleased mixes of back catalogue gems a point well made on the more downtempo first disc terry grant s i ll kill you softly is an early highlight on layer 1 unleashing the smooth and seductive vocals of jennifer horne there are some delightful smooth productions here such as the hypnotic mellow sounds of yunus guvenen s open arms as well as astrid s delicious vocal remix of all i know luke chable delivers a real tasty treat in the am bee en tea remix of melburn while voyager and kris avedon deliver their 2nd track in the disc with the melodic and spaced out sounds of downtown bubble nick muir john digweed team to deliver a smooth and groovy remix of glimmer by quincy jones bill cosby the hallmark vocal effects of steiger s postcards from the edge feature as does the stunning downey remix of jiva s strange dimensions a real delight thanks to its vocal wails and smooth melodic touches terry grant finishes that album as he started it this time with john debo delivering a very smooth conclusion with his remix of i ll kill you it concludes what is quite simply a very tasty and smooth first disc that showcases some very high quality remixes of bedrocks biggest anthems it doesn t take long for layer 2 to lift the pace with the chunky broken beat sounds of fretwell s gritty remix of bedrock s forge and then the smooth baselines of reality theory opening this disc superbly many of you should know how brilliant the grayarea remix of bedrock s emerald is but if not then you will discover its brilliance early on in this mix the mix moves into 4/4 territory and unleashes some smooth and chunky baselines with the help of aimless dame and then dousk s very solid pa dida there are some smooth melodies as well from the likes of derek howell and pob taylor while tim skinner martin accorsi add some twisted techy edges midway in there s some good funk thrown in for good measure by luke fair with lokitas which then moves into some more twisted breakbeat sounds brought to you by weird continental types and then elite force the tough gritty baselines of nick muir s remix of pole folder s salvation on slavery sins drives the album home nicely in the penultimate track a track that merges smoothly into the driving sounds and epic moments of max graham s stoppage time remix by guy gerber it concludes quite an interesting disc that moves from an array of different sounds quite smoothly and somehow all gems together like a john digweed mix well if you are a fan as i am then you will definitely be impressed with this mix layer 1 is worth the cd price alone with a mix of some real stunning downtempo versions all compiled together superbly and with though unlike the multitude of label albums you often find on the record store shelves later 2 you most likely have heard before but its again compiled in a very artistic way adding to the strength of this very solid release layer 1 1 terry grant - ill kill you (softly) 2 voyager kris avedon - the march (original) 3 yunus guvenen - open arms (original) 4 morgan - all i know (astrids downtempo version) 5 luke chable - melburn (am bee en tea mix) 6 yunus guvenen - indigo (original) 7 voyager kris avedon - downtown bubble (original) 8 steiger - postcard from the edge (ambient mix 2) 9 jiva - strange dimensions (downey mix) 10 terry grant - ill kill you (john debo ambient mix) layer 2 1 bedrock - forge (fretwell remix) 2 kvk - reality theory 3 bedrock - emerald (grayareas speakeasy mix) 4 astro glyde - aimless dame (rjones delayed dub) 5 dousk - pa dida (original) 6 derek howell - happy to be sad (original) 7 pob taylor - aura (northern lights mix) 8 skinner accorsi - playing for digweed 9 luke fair - lokitas (original mix) 10 steiger - postcard from the edge (breaks mix 11 weird continental types - phat as (original) 12 elite force - sk8r (original) 13 pole folder - salvation on slavery sins (nick muir remix) 14 guy gerber - stoppage time (max graham sidechain remix)
this is the third in detroit label s occasional modern underground music series of compilation eps this edition features solely motor city based artists and its from rush hour alumni thats the most instantly arresting a no nonsense house banger it cranks up slowly through an intoxicating mix of tumbling kicks a croaking acid bassline and diva ish vocals before finally hitting top gear with a hands in the air at sunrise synth line other cuts are more slow burning synth chirrups and echoing vocals of s create a spacey aesthetic crunching bass and crisp drums complete a moody brew walks faces defiantly away from the floor its smoky wisps of synth slow mo drums and glowing pads have a pleasing early warp feel but the track runs out of ideas well before it ends by closes in experimental fashion with freeform keys and thudding bass rubbing up against a wall of pads and female vocal snippets its an interesting but not overly essential end to an ep whose a side comfortably outshines its flip
gian and massimiliano pagliara play very different records the former plays sinister electro while the latter looks to melodic and glimmering house still theres something fitting about their collaboration for the latest lackrec 12-inch perhaps because the berlin label often touches on a number of club styles take its previous release lack012 from di-x as sbc which speeds like techno but beams like house on gian and massi craft another pleasing overlap: acid-flecked electro with a warm glow you get a sense of the eps landscape from its titles names like and reflect the soft atmospheres that surround the crispy electro drums each track is a subtle shift on this idea the title track has a cosmic drift with chords and melodies that float over a sharp beat gets trippier its frenzied drums and sticky acid line pumping through a smeared backdrop with a singing bassline and funky squelches rounds out the record with the brightness that makes lackrec such a vivid source of club beats
straight out of dallas texas comes the progressive/breaks duo known as and theyve seen one of their releases put on the boomtronics compilation which was released last year which is very representative of their sound - techy deep nu-skool breaks is their latest effort and is out on it starts off with an interesting introduction - warped hi-hat samples before the breaks kick in its a very sublime affair to kick things off - a deep bassline with lots of tweaking and manipulation in it plenty of atmospheric samples lying on top and a breakbeat pattern worthy of koma bones style production its a good tune definitely one for an atmospheric nu-skool breaks djs box you can check out sound samples of this and other material at s website
berlins house fraternity (and sorority) come out to play on this ep extract from prosumers new panorama bar mix compilation the vibe as you might expect is decidedly old school with piling up elements piano synth vocal samples crowd noise and much more into a euphoric mess its almost overstuffed but not quite house music house of cards is the alias for someone that most should be able to guess from the name if that isnt enough its a loop y little number whose streaming hook will tease you all night long its surface level love though and nothing deeper the gem here is also prosumers opening track on the mix s is probably best suited for opening or closing duties its weepy vocal and minor chords wont exactly have you dancing swaying sure crying possibly those are the records however that you remember the next day
james clements 2010 album nothing is certain not only rejuvenated the san diego producers career but more importantly it started him down a winding path of musical exploration by now hes moved on from drum bass to something more open-ended a style marked by cinematic atmospheres and mournful melodies hes also reignited his passion for ambient (a style hes been dabbling in since well before nothing is certain ) signing to bcs and now delivering his third full-length for the label in as many years its telling that clements doesnt use another alias for this work really does sound like only collapsed and disintegrated res a stillness to clements ambient composition that matches s preoccupation with nature se tracks are like field recordings from some imaginary world re are rustles here and there and implacable distant noises carefully built ecosystems are contained within each one clements is a master of creating moods and setting scenes: evokes a massive space with its yawning melodies while the airy sends a chill through the room while there are no real hooks on the way clements sticks to a classicist model of ambient music is riveting in its own way melodies unspool fluidly over the course of six or seven minutes gently repeating like a woven tapestry but with enough going on underneath to make every track fascinating lp ebbs in and out of more lucid moments too like the plaintive guitar and bass work on the quavering or the almost-startling presence of vocals on only which sounds like the previous eight tracks layered on top of each other delivers full filmic scale but the conclusion feels earned after the slow drift of the rest of the album complex but rarely dense puts a lot of different ideas into its slowly simmering pot its a wide-ranging style clements has already shown off with his podcasts which connect post-punk and 80s pop with electronic music his love for groups like cocteau twins is obvious on and it comes through in subtle ways the watery echo of pads on or the shimmering post-rock of light discerning moments like these keep the album from congealing into beatless mush when is playing it becomes your surroundings rather than merely soundtrack them

its not too hard to see why d koze signed for his label it sounds strikingly like international pony in fact especially given the flourishes of chicken-scratch guitar the loose drums and live bass and r b vocals that coast just this side of parody but theres nothing goofy about the track fluid expertly shaped and layered its a straight up lovers jam and as sensual as can be if anything is even deeper therell be no mistaking this for any other chord-heavy house tune thanks to a vocal refrain i woke up with your name on my lips that recurs throughout the tune without ever wearing out its welcome (the title a reference to uthern rappers cough-syrup-laced beverage of choice presumably explains the chopped-and-screwed lilt to the sample husky slurred hypnotic ) but its not just the salient ures that make the track exceptional; anyone could take a phrase like that and pair it with a moody organ chord progression over a jacking house beat hell were drowning in readymades like that but takes those pieces and runs as far as it can with them at least as far as someone can get when theyre wading through codeine from the dubby breakdown to the long arc of the whole track its a trip and surprisingly forceful given its soft sounds and slow tempo (the bassline and handclaps work overtime to keep things lively ) is a beautiful bright-eyed house tune that plays a re-sampled piano solo awkward and jittery against spongy muted chords you can really hear the difference between sampling and synthesis here: as with pepe bradocks music everything here feels slightly unstable with every raw edge creating a tiny filigree of discord the result surprisingly is far smoother and softer than youd ever get with mere machines more than bradock though the track feels like an old pal oey track from the vocal sample ( every time which sounds an awful lot like oeys party time ) to the four-minute running time
the is -product of two of dutch coasts greatest nu jack 303-toting talents coming toge r in studio danny legowelt wolfers and brian orgue electronique chinettis strange frightening yet exhilarating vision has only been realised on vinyl a few times previously but each missive is worth checking this release is no exception the opening title track redefines term epic but naturally this is no hands-in- -air prog euphoria instead its a dizzyingly fluid arrangement that shifts from powerful claps and eerie synth lines into claustrophobic crashing snares and an atmospheric string sequence sees duo revert to a deeper approach with trippy 303 lines underpinned a warm purring bassline it sounds like it was conceived to provide listener with a brea r because flip side features a salvo of bass-heavy tracks of three provides most visceral approach rumbling along with an ominous ass-quaking bass however contains its own dance floor immediacy in form of spine-tingling snare rolls while is a gloopy dirge powered acid-flecked bass licks fashioned deranged provocateurs is one of coasts most intense contributions to chicago jack italo horror soundtrack continuum
in his diy video for the devilish from s first solo ep for funkinevens apron label the london newcomer skulks around an urban setting at night the screen subtly flickers as sinister images share the frame with his wandering while his thick-skinned house works out a heavy relentless groove the end has emerged from a market to find himself transported to the bright bustling streets of tokyo another layer of hallucinogenic disorientation the video nicely sums up the other tracks on also push a dark distorted aesthetic the record seems tailor made for funkinevens label with its grimy analog mixdowns and rigid detroit-isms but none of it feels contrived s clipping 909s and retro sci-fi fx act as frisky accents to the bassline the warehouse-ready sepentinas anchors itself to an industrial drum sequence as it tries on a series of blown-out percussive layers and familiar as the motif is sounds too in-the-zone to be referencing say british murder boys only senzo wears its influence brazenly; three minutes of muffled drum machines and schlocky horror soundtrack vibes is a poor way to close an otherwise formidable release
is still alive and kicking but a lot of it just isnt very interesting anymore was started two years ago in foundational london record shop lackmarket when it pressed up two slabs of lithe white-label dubstep it finally returns in with a third vinyl-only release from former drum bass producer two tracks whose massive sense of scale sets them apart from their heavy-lidded contemporaries recalling the glory days of distance balances precision drum hits with synth guitar and threatening wobbles only instead of ham-fisted machismo were suspended over a pitch black valley of reverb s grip on dynamics and tension is extreme even for dubstep and the two tracks pull on the genres thread of anxiety until the whole things a pulsating core of dread taking a relaxed back seat on first listen is more trip-hop than dubstep only the very light reggae flourishes and the voracious lfo remind us which genre were listening to and thats probably why these tracks sound so fresh in the first place
is a deep optimistic soulful jazzy collaboration between dj spinna (aka vincent williams) and new york duo heavy (nicky guiland and casey benjamin) perfect for summer days/nights this release also includes remixes from osunlade (head of yoruba records) the club mix kicks off with a slightly broken instrumental followed by a jazzy piano the vocals of nicky guiland which thankfully are not overpowering combine with a deep soulful melody to build the track up to its peak when the rhythm and samba drums kick in this version should mix well with a masters at work or mark mac (4hero) release for those of you who dont like vocals check the club instrumental mix which has been stripped of the vocal on the flip osunlades is more latin tinged with heavy percussion stripped out cosmic melodies and a deadly bass line a cleaner cut it still preserves the deep soulful vibe but allows the vocal to roll more freely in tandem with delicate chords which push the track forward a typical osunlade remix it works in elements of jazz samba and heavy percussion with rolling and punchy beats as with the a-side there is a similar instrumental version too is another strong effort from dj spinna with spot on remixes keep an eye out for further releases from mr williams maybe he can indeed change the world </b
under the moniker parisian peltier sylvain has just a couple of years worth of releases on relatively small labels like syncrophone and plastic c to his name construct form is his own new imprint with aims as yet unclear ased on this first record however it might encompass both contemporary and bygone sounds the -side takes care of the latter using a groove la chord -style construction its built around a single motif which sylvain runs through various mutations moving the notes enough to hold interest but keep the hooks identity intact gain like groove la chord and quite a few tracks from that era the lead synth has a stabby swirling quality undulating violently through the tracks 909-sourced drums while some may find a piece like this derivative so late in the game its nice to hear it executed so well in -form things slow considerably taking the tempo under 120 its just one signifier of a more current composition while its counterpart is overtly big room this one seems tailored for an even bigger space one starting with and rhyming with nerghain dessicated but forceful kicks pound out a rhythm assisted by equally parched cymbals and claps this lumbering skeleton partially obscures the marked influence of dub as found in previous work like dark nebula most of the interesting bits lie hidden in bottomless currents of bass their minute but powerful changes easy to miss
is label boss of moovment records out of montepellier and the is his first outing on intec with releases such as docker on kompakt s speicher series ploof daddy on ovum as well appearances on eukahouse and wagrum this frenchman gets around pooks has also firmed his footing in europe with namechecks from techno djs such as marco bailey and valentino kanzyani the title track is bumpy mid-tempo minimal with a shifting bassline tone that just about keeps it from becoming an average plodder there are no melodic elements here just sinister spidery acid lines that create a menacing air as the build-up raise the ante towards its end jocker lacks a real groove but it s jerky patterns could shake up a dancefloor it s unlike anything i ve heard on intec though so perhaps the novelty factor may work in its favour blue scream is much more of the pooks brand of techno this time built around a wailing melodic snippet quite similar in construction to some of alexander konig s tracks its trancey feel may cast your mind back to the bellboy catalogue in particular with its euphoric edge this could well see the most support out of the three tracks on offer the ep finishes on much the same note as it began on housyway a vague backward glance at oldskool acid house more spooky doings here and while pooks shows his potential for nice sounds the track attempts to weave a hypnotic groove without ever quite achieving it intec appear to be testing the waters possibly hinting at a shift towards more minimal house recent releases from smith selway pedro delgardo and leandro gamez have all been more peaktime techno affairs so this ep may puzzle younger intec fans in particular who might have been expecting a less subdued project definitely not one of the more memorable intec releases
on corner a four track ep marking launch of new brooklyn label starts off in inarguably great past and winds up in more fruitfully undefined present old school house track by new york producer (a sometime trumpeter for metro area ) couldnt be more of a throwback if it tried with buoyant piano snippets of soulful vocals and antic hi hats t sound like a bunch of spare change bouncing on a baking tin by berlins marries a similar early 90s house style to what sounds like some almost balearic guitar which cuts through spells of piano and hazy notions of syn sized flute both tracks are artful and certainly well done but both are also a little too in thrall to lineage for ir own good on flip are two tracks t venture out and find ir way into some majestic and certainly more surprising moments by english producer rackem is basically a slow simmering few note house throb but in fits and starts it throws out some great bracing horn sounds and trilling strings refined and dexterous enough for classical music by brooklyns is stranger and more affecting n anything else here: a big gloopy mess of a house track padded with slurping synths and what sounds like tape run backward picked apart its sounds could be sourced as historical but swirled toge r as y are y manage to connect in ways t sound new
are important because they represent an attempt to bring two musical ingredients live performance and improvisation to the techno party a genre where live more often than not means pressing play on a software program hether it s a matter of the technology not being up to the task yet or the difficulty of playing instruments which essentially play themselves true live techno performers are still few and far between and bands even rarer still it is an unsatisfying situation for both musicians and audiences alike: solo live p a s can often lack the spark of musicians feeding off each other in real time and you ve got to feel sorry for the artists who for lack of a better alternative make their living running through sets of the same pre-recorded tracks weekend after weekend no wonder they look so glum it s a pity then that cobblestone s debut album fails to live up to the band s stated mission it s not what you d expect stead of spending a week doing studio sessions jazz style and delivering a coherent document of their present sound the album is cobbled together from various previously released eps and favourite jams and the result is a mishmash with little sense of defined place and time four tracks on the album have been released previously in identical versions and the hits and dia in also return on the bonus this recycling wouldn t matter so much if the band itself didn t put such a premium on immediacy and spontaneity but the result is disappointing for those listening for something now things start promisingly with the lovely openers and kicking off the record in a gliding expectant mood but when the jumpy single the arrives the spell breaks and from that point on you re not listening to a coherent artistic vision but simply a collection of tracks some of these tracks are excellent though ironically for an improv group the most structured track is the standout culled from cocoon compilation g is a classic techno builder present here in its original form and as a live jam on the in bonus disc live version is satisfying too and very different proving that the improv claims of cobblestone are no joke other highlights are a straight ahead funk-techno track and which has an appealing whiteboy afro vibe both are spacious cuts with killer basslines that will play out well in the clubs tellingly these tracks are the least jazzy i know i know complaining about being jazzy is like complaining about tallica being metal but with two mad soloists on board in the form of jonson (bass) and tate (live keys) the jazz cuts on are often simply too busy to appeal much both the title track and the reprised as on the bonus disc are one-upmanship jams at their worst grafting the least appropriate jazz form the virtuoso solo onto the techno format like the emperor said to mozart there are too many notes more successful is where the jazz element is not keyboard shredding but subtle drawn out horns giving the track room to breathe and dancers room to move all in all i don t think you can judge the experiment a failure by this record that s something which stands or falls out in the clubs but as a document of the band and as an album is a huge disappointment i would recommend that djs pick up the 3x vinyls to spin the standout cuts but given the ambitions of the band thats not exactly a ringing endorsement
borrowing from 70s and 80s funk is nothing novel but few do it as well as san franciscos b bravo who now backs his meaty groovy sound up with a full band his latest ep with keyboardist teeko for san fran outfit shows him at his most triumphant is a pretty damn accurate title as bravo teeko lay out all their sonic trademarks methodically and leisurely winding synth lines twirl and pirouette vocoders mumble and each bar hits with an impressive force thats nonetheless gentle and caressing his sanguine groove is alive and human the kind of thing jimmy edgar might make if he was a frontman for a band rather than a bedroom producer rest of the ep is interchangeable variations on the same theme a pleasant blur of boogie a is even more squiggly curling each staggering beat around a squeaky vocal most successful is murdas me) which bolsters the duos core sound with emphatic pitchbenders and punchy horn samples ir attempts at electronic/acoustic fusion arent always so serene however and has a raspy female vocal that seems to get lost in the duos thick woods of intertwining melody lines and offbeat boogie ep wraps up with a which incorporates live piano and what sounds like live bass for something that veers dangerously close to session musician-ism but survives by way of its own conviction

i loved s frankfurt sour which kicked off the ra motorcitysoul podcast and ran for its entire ten-glorious-minute duration following barebones detroit house tropes all throbbing analogue components and a dystopian bleep riff which could and did go on forever it might have been made ten years ago yet still sounded fresh as a result came my way with serious baggage and while it by no means lives up to its predecessor what could it delivers enough punch over its varied tracks to be worth investigating lead single is the weakest thing here formulaic tech house made up of commercially slick loops which flail about but go nowhere its a slow building track with a bass drop midway bringing the only drama its brought down by the irritating hey vocal which persistently unvaryingly repeats itself chinese dub puts things right its bolder rhythms bringing an immediate hit and a chinese zither break adding a welcome kookiness most importantly the vocals gone odder still is a fusion of wispy traum wooziness with deeper drums bittersweet trance melodies are tapped out on dinky chimes and dog toy squeaks skirting dangerously close to cheese but coming out clean two strong tracks then but still disappointing compared to his earlier work
best known as producers (remember chart topper story ) or as residents at london club nd duo bushwacka are perhaps a surprising choice for s longst ing mix series t s been four years since their previous mix ight which did mix the old with the new but stretches the concept to breaking point: disc one focuses exclusively on house classics while disc two compiles hot new(ish) tracks result predictably is two very different outcomes retro chic is not something that is best known for but on disc one few artists from the golden age are left unchecked unior vasquez anny tenaglia ajmere all mashed up in a rapid fire y mixing style that screams early nineties problem with the mix is not the programming or the mixing both of which are top notch but its relevance in this context: this is the first g mix to be retrospective series fans expecting the best in current progressive are likely to be nonplussed anwhile the target audience for a mix like this hardcore househeads are not exactly g followers isc two focuses strictly on the latest developments in house music so it is no shock to find the big names in minimal well represented espite being surefooted catchy unfortunately there are not enough surprises in the track selection ll worn hits such as s an t ompare samim s remix of onsuelo ie s get another rinsing making this disc in its own way as familiar as disc one some great cuts from dam contribute a nice crunchy techno bite but there is a nagging feeling that this mix has all been done before bushwacka have tried to bring a fresh approach to the series there are places which work well on both mixes but overall you can t escape the feeling that this is inappropriate stuff for g maybe with the dearth of decent prog out there in they ve run out of suitable c idates
take a look at s blog and you get the feeling the lads behind it like the simple things in life beefy house and disco banter and burgers staying on brand the first release on the northern irish duos new label keeps things nicely uncomplicated n ep of unashamedly retro house music of seems to take the best obscure 90s cuts from their blog fillet out the choice elements and then stitch the whole thing back together with a hefty dose of bottom-end take exhibit : parping mk horns drum programming that could be from a nice ripe record and cut up vox that may or may not have been lifted from an early kerri chandler effort its a cut and shut of a record but theres simply no denying what an effective club track it is continues in a similar fashion its all swinging new jersey snares splashy hi-hats and naggingly familiar sounding vocal stabs the highlight of the ep by quite some distance is of mixing euphoric pianos and high octane vocal ticks the record has an air of tony lionnis epic found a place about it: albeit with an added garage bump thrown in its the kind of record that instantly paints a smile across a sweaty club at 5 m unfussy and straight to the point its quite simply a banger many producers or label owners for that matter take years to find a voice thats theirs with this ep and a hugely well-received release on fever records are already settling on a style that they can ostensibly call their own even if most of the best bits would seem to be borrowed from house musics class of 94
if tommy four sevens 2011 album primate wasnt easy on the listener neither was it on the artist himself trading standard percussion for samples of trains and tinfoil twisted into rhythmic shapes primate was an admirable attempt to move away from technos production-line sounds yet ironically the musics metallic clanks made it sound and feel like a production-line grinding into life mostly churning out slight variations on an industrial techno template despite the unusual components hed constructed it from tommy four sevens collaboration with james kronier aka alain is something much more individual an engineer at the one million mangos studio in berlin alains influence is most apparent in the sound design: where primate groaned under layers of fuzz and distortion gleams in comparison though its still as bloody and raw as a side of meat hanging in an abattoir the most marked progression is in the structure rather than being straitjacketed into a linear 4/4 thump tracks like feel loose albeit with basslines that reverberate with tightly-coiled aggression indeed the rhythms of make it sound more like a diseased machinedrum track than anything from tommy four sevens back catalogue a more melodic sensibility has also come to the fore with its sombre yet soaring synths came as something of a surprise when it was released as the albums first single and while thats far and away the most tuneful moment here other tracks contain snatches of space and melody amidst the darkness notably which evokes the post-apocalyptic landscape of cormac mccarthys the road still will satisfy those seeking brutalist warehouse weaponry much of the music here still sounds like tortured cables being stretched to breaking point whether or not those noises come from more conventional sources than the field recordings used for primate isnt really relevant for here have created an album where the finished product is much more interesting than the process
hands and brotherly love are in the air as the jonson siblings nathan and mathew pool resources for in the case of nathans project that means unleashing an enormous stomping peak time techno blitz with embossing it with a brandy sample that stutters and whirrs like uk garage gone nasty look past the vocals and theres a breathless galloping rhythm track underpinning them with machine gun bursts of hi hats a breakdown that sounds like big ben reprogrammed by dr evil and waves of malevolent synths the hrdvsiovsiivosvsiosvin remix easier to say at 4 m when such babble is more acceptable attacks the original with squelchy roger troutman cosmic funk keys and crunching electro beats but understandably finds it difficult to keep pace with the originals intensity the fruits of mathew and nathans joint venture has a brooding stripped down techno tude it glowers from the shadows created by a low slung indie style bassline and jerking percussive fizz and pop
as a species were obsessed with our own demise films tv shows and news the consensus seems to say that were heading towards a dark and dreadful future disagrees im all about utopian futures he told fact last year the rbma alumni is a positive futurist and the music on his debut album mirrors that outlook it lands on the audiovisual platform (real name alan stanley soucy brinsmead) set up with zora jones in 2012 has only recently started functioning as a label that is releasing music but it remains an online multimedia hub (each track on the album available on s website comes with its own interactive environment ) the music on s is as colourful as the labels visual identity the album is a sparkling synergy of club pop and choral music its resolutely bright and uplifting due in part to the high-pitched vocals that surface throughout is one of the more obvious examples of all three core elements at work there are angelic choir boy vocals enormous strings and horns and a bass music rumble dark moments are rare on as a whole is deeply inventive and the tracks will slay dance floors cant is a catchy bass hit theres a touch of sepalcure about the lush dedicated to dj rashad is a chipper footwork track the best here though is a screwy crunk classic and one of the albums few aggy moments forward-thinking dance music tends to be difficult to digest its about taking risks and shattering the rules brinsmeads music both risky and moreish dares to imagine an uplifting future
what is it about this label and its name whatever it is this label is producing some of the top stuff at this moment a relatively new label sees its 7th release with the vancouver based producer (label also based in british columbia canada) flexing his technical ability conceiving two brilliant tracks one of the which typerope has been championed by the likes of the techno legend richie hawtin and ricardo villalobos (featured in his latest cocoon mix cd taka taka) typerope is the kind of track that lingers in your mind for a while in a good way armed with a highly infectious melody beefed up with a big bouncy funky bassline it is not surprising why this track is being supported by many djs the second track on this release is aptly named magic through music the trippy hypnotic sounds that echoes in and out of the fluid melodies sucks you into a dimension where sound-scapes reaches far beyond the horizon an incredibly beautiful track that must only be heard in order to comprehend a job well-done by m jonson other releases on this label is also worth checking out not forgetting the first release which is also done by the man himself
is a live dance duo from london and wales not much is known as to what mfa stands for or even about the twosome who is comprised of one ali and rhys pair first meet at school in 2000 and then again in 2001 a quote on their website: 2001 - ali and rhys meet again ali proclaims his love of dance music while rhys prefers the super furry animals strange but humorous material if you asked me wasn t until 2002 when the par started to write music with a few tracks under their belt john digweed picked up one of them and played it on his kiss 100fm nights later orderman himself james holden got a hold of the par and has now released their newest piece of music: like the previous releases from c you see an original cut but this time there is no beaty tool instead we welcome an alternate mix by petter (who s name has been everywhere at the moment) and an experimental fix from themselves original is a lo-fi dubby sound meant for the home eautiful slices of dubby-tech house with compressed guitars and abstract sliced vocals are the main course from start to finish the track is minimal in nature you can hear the influence that oards of canada have on the two music moves so gently and softly you get lost inside of it efore you know it the track finishes and somehow seven-minutes have passed s a bit hard to describe but the song is almost invisible you know something is there but somehow you never notice it i like this track and i think you will too fix is filled with random fx s and rolling electro bass experimental electronica it seems that no one is doing it these days oodles of eerie sweeping fx s and few sliced-up vocals creep in for the breakdown in the midst of rolling heavy beats following it with acid trips to end the music a 180 degree from the original not wanting to stay in one element you can hear the diverse range and talents the duo has with the swedish producer peter nordkvist on helm you knew there would be no worries involved petter s version is a furious acid-tech mix while the original and fungle fix were experimental mixes petter devises a lighting bolt to hit the floor track is spacey and wicked heavy acid rains rising melodies and smooth beats releases out from the version something exceptionally fun for the dj to play that fits very well in a progressive set techno or breaks set a sick remix that not only massive but scarily good james holden s dreams have come to fruition; emerging as one of the most creative and forward-thinking labels to come about since the early days of hardkiss and guerrilla this latest outing is a balance of quality and class has created something of a hidden gem if i must say most people may not understand it and most will probably not play it in a club nevertheless if you own a copy you ll come back to it with no fear of the unknown i wish the best in its young and vivid outlook
when your first record is as breathtakingly beautiful as peru chances are youre going to heap a whole load of expectation on your own shoulders how you handle that weight of expectation is borne out through the rest of your career as however long said career turns out to be people will always quite naturally tend to judge against their initial experience of you nd while his latest ep isnt as spine-tingling as his debut it certainly suggests that theres plenty more where that particular gem came from the entire ep occupies a particular space; muted tones and heavily filtered washes create a happily downbeat atmosphere that never quite breaks free of the shackles of solemnity not that its trying to the title track does little more than introduce a few weary oooh s and a couple of lazy claps to the proceedings and yet dull it most certainly is not adopts a more upbeat chicago vibe while by far the most clearly dance floor-focused track on the ep hits almost tech house territory with rhythmic vocal stabs and a fiercely energetic collection of hats what stands out most about salas is the sheer depth of production on what seem to be quite simple tracks if that seems like a contradiction youre probably right more than most however salas seems able to pull you deep into his work even if theyre not to your particular taste something that makes me excited to hear what hes going to do next
favors a subtle pared-down aesthetic but dont call it minimal the label a berlin concern with links to leeds and newcastle owes more than a little to perlon their first release even came from audio werner who put out a standout mid-2000s 12-inch for the legendary imprint but it wouldnt exist without uk dance trends from garage through to hessle audio boss has naturally embodied that mix of influences as well as any of their other signings where his one previous ep colours laid the groundwork goes one step further fleshing out the skippy atmospheric style one might call signature sound the title cut is precisely that: a clean path of precision drums cut through icily melodic canyons in terms of sound design is the records highlight sitting at the exact midpoint of well-calibrated danceability and warped gas-style ambience in form though its a bit bloated could have wrapped up about two minutes earlier or found a more winding path down the slopes crafts something more engaging out of the same formula even if its pads lack the same detailed psychedelic twinge here incorporates a couple of critical breakdowns and resets which lets him stockpile some much-needed tension while keeping the arrangement uncluttered his best work yet though is a peculiar agglomeration of distortion dissonance and rhythmic drive is obviously a fan of adventurous combinations and somewhere just shy of two minutes when a reverbed-to-infinity flute cuts in over his well-wrought drums you can tell hes hit on a special one
feed me records have put out successive releases since its inception that has kept us guessing as to what will come next and following on from the current offering- raven gipsy ep from moonbeam we see their eighth offering in the shape of a tight progressive number from tim davison dale anderson the more i know gets a distinct sumsonic flavour on the a side with a paul rogers remix taking off from the start with a pensive groove thats brought on by neat percussive rhythms and a subtle bassline which is added to by another as a melody develops through the use of mystical flute sounds while this is happening a gradual build of vocally synth patterns alternate with the melody producing the result of notching it up a level events are slow moving but the overall effect comes to fruition in an unnoticed way blossoming at the break with blissful female vocal cut and soothing pads to create the high point on the b side is the original mix which comes as a peakier dose with tougher beats behind a scene of atmospheric pads and delayed hits bouncing off each other as underneath a deeper side begins to creep through a sparkly rhodes melody emerges from in between the mood as proceedings break with the slightly energetic melody bringing the energy back up nice its may not be as peaktime as weve heard before but its another strong offering from this portuguese imprint that leaves the door open for where you want to take it in a set

in this age of cultural superabundance listeners often turn to labels for guidance dont seem interested in this role as strict curatorial filter instead they favour more is more as demonstrated by the labels tenth birthday series: ten 12 inches released over a year featuring artists as diverse as call super egyptian lover and gigi masin connections between those featured are often hard to decipher but the seventh instalment is an exception uniting diverse producers in strange psychedelia frenchmen of different generations open and close the ep s is a curious beast twilit techno pulse suggests one mood but the italo arps deliver another and a four note melody is mixed piercingly bright like the audio equivalent of a laser pointer to the retina versatiles gilbr explores subtler contrasts uniting all manner of muted sounds hand drums flute freaky oscillator sweeps over the 105 bpm throb of by resonates nicely with both tracks weighty slow mo groove matches gilbr the salon resident is after all the master of the leftfield chug and the ambiguity in its competing synth parts echoes offers some contrast to set the palate tingling he cant quite expunge ruffneck uk swing from whose grainy drums frame bleak blaring melody
news from our beloved therapist that is the chief audio therapist dave seaman is that his record label is five years old to mark the occasion the head honcho has put out this is a double cd which includes some of the labels past releases mixed by himself (cd1) and several of the tracks on cd1 and other unreleased pearls in an unmixed format (cd2) a first glance at the tracklisting for cd1 and it would seem seaman has been having it large in the home of socrates with quite a number of tracks coming from greek producers and indeed cd1 kicks off with a slice of grecian progressive breaks quiet from nick john dalagelis as the breakbeat a spacey fizzling harmony and howling voices take control the first moment on the mix appears in the from of an accapella of infusions legacy the catchy lyrics of synesthesia coloured blue aquaman knows what to do nicely complement the greek intro and lead into one of the hottest talents around habersham the awesome hi-hats solid funk and even some melodic drums loosen up things on habershams dryspell while those who like tech-edged electro sounds will appreciate the next three offerings from kosmas epsilon which build up to the first climax monster puppy has those typical awesome antsy synths and a slight breaks-oriented rhythm; sounds which are both delightful and a delight to dance to after the breakdown the bassline of the monstrous puppy starts to rumble; its hi-hat stabs intercepted more and more by the slamming v-sag interpretation of ill ssa there can be only one a collaboration between kosmas epsilon and viton is a proggier perhaps chable-esque piece - dark driving bass drums like guitar laden riffs that are loosened by airy vocals and synth riffs the skies suddenly clear as german oliver moldan delivers a funky percussive and wet variation of the phil k habersham track cloudbrake underlined by the accapella version of dave seamans own my own worst enemy the rework of cloudbrake from the tribehouse resident focuses on the guitar sample and ethnic vocal - wrapped in a jacket of funkier and more tribal elements - before being followed by moldans marraca h under his prawler moniker marraca h surprises with a balearic/latin character and changing background bass synth eliciting images of limbo dancing and booty-shaking madness the breakdown sees an arabic vocal thrown in before leading into hand claps which rise to the surface moldan is currently in the process of finishing his artist album and if these tracks are anything to go by it will definitely be one worth checking out marraca h dissolves into the deeper alternative mix of finding from greek producer stel feat john elliot with seaman; its changing bass structure making it sound more rock music oriented discreet acid noises and the male vocals of john elliot finish this track off nicely before hybrid step up with their storming 4/4 and breakbeats matrix dub arrangement of kiss for the dying from prog veterans killahurtz (lee fredericks nic britton and mick parks from tilt) hybrids distinctive way of juxtaposing beats with computer beeps trademark synths and running drums is the second peak on compilation make no mistake about it if this were rock music head banging would be mandatory tone depths dark dub of to the moon picks up the pace and tightens things up; its harder drums interlaced by hypnotic noises and layered by vocalist matt shapiro after the second beat eclipse seaman prepares us for the landing with the dimi phaze remix of phatjaks dirty sunday featuring a 70s style bass its like a nod to an old tv series giving the compilation a somewhat nostalgic fade out this therapy is much more enjoyable than the latest session with your shrink and in my opinion is a definitely a standout mix compilation for this year its just too bad that its not covered by health insurance
s has had a hand in plenty of the citys output over the past decade engineering for transmat tour managing derrick mays hi-tek soul project performing at demf/movement festivals in 2001 2004 and 2009 but he hasnt released much of his own music; according to discogs this is only the third release on his own records after a 2005 cdr and a 12-inch the following year pparently the main cut here originally appeared on that six-year-old cd which might not be too surprising; with pinging keys faintly reminiscent of the escalator company and shuffly congas and shakers recalling icans latin-tinged house its a timeless type of cut archetypal and yet also almost self-effacing might not notice it on first or third listen but those chiming chords have a way of sinking beneath your skin speaking of ican santiago salazar himself turns up on the remix spinning the chords of the original into a tense coiled uptempo jam driven by hissing hi-hats and plangent synths; you have to turn it up to fully appreciate the glissando whistling in the background reynolds other two original tracks gs and for a feel more like sketches but theyre both worthwhile the first takes thrumming carl craig-style chords and pairs them with a neatly collapsing martial drum break; for a is deeper and richer with parallel synth lines rubbing sensually against conga-driven disco breaks the latter at just 3:33 long is the shortest thing on a record whose tracks never break the six-minute mark but it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do mapping the precise dimensions of a tentative mood and a more determined groove lets hope we dont have to wait another five years for the follow-up
after a very busy year in which he put out more than a dozen records veteran producer is keeping pace in early with his fifth release so far it comes through leeds-based and you should know whats on the menu: deep analog house (and a touch of disco) that oozes soul title track keeps things nice easy and constantly but gently boiling over with blissful strings ups the tempo and darkens the strings summoning the nocturnal funk that wade is so well known for though it does sound a bit formulaic id say is the best of the originals as wade jumps back and forth between a low-key swagger topped with cheery vocal samples and a wonderfully cinematic keys and guitar-led instrumental three cuts are solid grooves that couldnt be mistaken for anyone else two remixes complete the package and wisely neither tries anything radical mr s version stretches out slides in a few shivering dub chords and squiggly synths and aims for a different sort of deep a digital-only remix from fina head and tom trades some of the originals laidback charm for higher bpms and a heavier approach with a fortunately short monologue and some interesting vocal loops linked with wades strings they help keep it classier than the usual tech house fluff
briefly appearing with three mysterious self-released eps of dark lean dubstep menace sadly disappeared in 2009 back into ghostly realm from whence y came before we could properly size m up thats why ir unexpected return on modeselektors label was such a lovely surprise: new tracks for label took previously sulking dubstep to new levels of junglist agility held down with a garish sense of occult this may be due to fact that y may have jettisoned a member in meantime but things as y tend to always be with are not exactly clear on that front n any case way weaves between styles and genres is almost steampunk desaturated retro sensibilities rendered in modern clean lines and art deco shapes a stunning fact mix was a good hint as to se split allegiances somehow stitching toge r jungle classical og dubstep and dm with an ear for extended blends that matched rhythmic complexity of ir own tracks suffocatingly dark it also made out to be well kind of scary ts fear that debut album feeds on ir music was always a little foreboding but its never been this directly threatening the sensibility manifests itself twofold split almost evenly throughout albums two halves first side creeps to life in a suitably spidery fashion establishing its curious mood of mock macabre and hammy horror from get-go opener wastes no time mixing trademark wildly-knifing drums with an assortment of real world sounds: bass guitar frantically dashed piano figures and horror movie motifs their unique palette strikes a chord thats psuedo-baroque: alternately throbbing and sweeping strings are draped all over record providing melodic accents here and brusque countermelodies re s second half sees crawling into sewers for something more concerned with chewing up continuum than mincing flesh album highlight shouldnt submerges things in sludge ala recent andy stott material all burnt handclaps and possessed arpeggios while n pulls apart jungle rhythms sounding like a garage beat caught up in a tornado never content to do less than three things at once however record marks a return to morbid with linking s atrical inclinations with straight dance music the housey hi-hats feel cruelly mocking and 808 rimshots hint at ir bass music compatriots for something that feels like a menacing perversion of chicago house revival really an album like shouldnt work as well it does: combination of junglist dread and b-movie devices seems too easy and transparent to be anything more than superficially pleasing but its not just about cross-genre inventiveness: its s visceral but measured impact taking jungles best attribute nimble yet punishingly tactile slam of breaks and fashioning an exacting but no less pleasing take tickling all same pleasure centres never quite picks one single niche to navigate but doesnt sprawl ei r packing a whole lot to chew on in forty minutes t turns out that is so much more than scary: its a little brilliant too if you can see past all that horror makeup
warsaws tom stempniewicz used to be a dubstep producer but his second ep for features two slabs of burnt-to-a-crisp techno or something close to techno anyways is essentially a brutal techstep tune thats been unspooled deep robotic vocals sludgy basslines and big-room drums sound like noisia and although its fascinating to hear these elements presented in a less claustrophobic manner (there are still some heavy-duty drops) its cartoonishness could be a turn-off for some is faster with coiled drums that slam in a pseudo-dubstep style and a spoken-word britney sample that elevates the track to an absurdly epic level remixes are as good if not better than the originals deft turns into a drum bass banger but he retains the tunes distinct sense of space turning in a twisted rework that recalls recent tracks by fracture and om unit unknown to unknown associate kodiak makes into a mangled number that hops along like stunted uk funky bamboomans remix is even weirder keeping the skeleton intact and adding jazzy noodling and other little sounds here and there
with george levings forging on with the name alone as guy brewer shifts his attention to another project dusted marks the end of an era for one of drum basss most lauded outfits their first and only album call to mind is rightfully considered a late-period masterpiece the kind of record that gets a full remix album three years later and still feels completely relevant this ones a collection of tracks from 2003-2008 most of them recorded around the call to mind sessions and they share in that albums sterling musicality and minted melodies but not its adventuresome spirit where call to mind effortlessly worked in all sorts of influences for a vibrant multifarious whole dusted despite its odds-and-sods nature actually feels a little more unified around a single vibe ts a jazzy muted one with tracks that shine with a sepia-toned nostalgic hue appropriate for a collection thats essentially a bittersweet farewell things start off typically with as piano samples twirl around a crisp drum break like a woozy spinning top soulful vocal soundbites heart-swelling basslines and mournful horns echoing in the distance this is at their most identifiable and that describes quite a few of the songs here twists saxophone samples and choked vocals around steel-plated beats while so many other tracks spread shimmering samples tinkling glass keys and icy strings to create sublime arctic soundscapes an undeniably pretty album dusted s formula of brittle metal and lush rushing synths starts to wear after a while especially since it lacks the percussive diversity or structural unpredictability of call to mind t sounds more like a collection of singles one that doesnt hold enough variety to hold up over the course of almost eighty minutes towards the end of the album they start to show some wandering eyes: emerges from gravelly washes of synth into a dissolute shaking skip that sounds like burial if he used jungle as his template rather than el-b while sounds like wormhole -era neurofunk slathered in hollywood polish the album closes with the wistful mixing cobbled-together breaks with sprightly pianos: its pretty much acid jazz and that it doesnt float away on its own disinterested lightheartedness says a lot about this duos distinct talent for keeping the physical edge in even their prettiest audio daydreams as if almost defensive of the albums perceived quality as a leftovers collection the duo single out as a track deserving of inclusion on call to mind in a press release while its certainly not the most impressive track on the release its an appropriate microcosm for dusted as a whole as jazzy synths murmur quietly underneath drums and pads so crisp and refreshing they sound like they could quench thirst bubbles and rises but never quite gives in to climax and thats kind of how feel about dusted ts a collection of tracks from some of the most brilliant minds to ever produce at 170 beats per minute but its nothing you havent heard before from them diehard fans will fawn over tracks like and suppose thats who this compilation is aimed at newcomers are better off going to call to mind and when theyre sufficiently in love and clamoring for more dusted will do nicely
when richie hawtin was invited to play at the guggenheims international gala last fall he took the opportunity seriously instead of giving the crowd of celebrities and socialites a typical hawtin set he holed up and wrote an albums worth of new material material to be specific which meant brooding techno in the vein of his finest work now mute have packaged that set as a live album the closest thing to a new record since 2003s closer more of a tantalizing snapshot than a proper lp leaves a little to be desired but it also shows that hawtin hasnt totally lost the genius that made his early work so beloved doesnt offer any surprises for fans of vintage hawtin but theres a real thrill in hearing that unmistakable synth line hit in bare and unfussy the album recalls closer which put a more polished spin on the formula works with a similar palette: strands of 303 pitter-patter drum machines and somber synths that feel out the space around them perhaps owing to hawtins latter-day big room leanings that space is suddenly huge and enveloping even with the minimalist style otherwise the ibiza flourishes are kept mostly in check aside from a dramatic synth swoosh here and there only the bobbing tech house bassline of or the regrettable whoopie-cushion bassline of pander to the kind of parties hawtin most often plays these days the rest of is careful and methodical theres some heavy duty low-end but its restrained even the bleeps and playful hi-hats of which sounds like it might burst at the seams dont deliver the resolution they promise instead hawtin fades back out with the spare squeezing some final resonance out of those well-worn sounds this one is the albums best it could easily fit on a classic record but its an ending that will inevitably leave some underwhelmed its likely a result of circumstance: you cant just let it rip at a fancy gala which makes it frustrating that hawtin would release instead of a proper album its easy to daydream about the kind of post-production wizardry he could have applied to a studio recording and as much of a landmark as the guggenheim gig might have been for him its less exciting as a recording the first new material in over ten years was always going to carry some high expectations and as solid as it is this one doesnt quite match up the way its presented feels like a bone to chew on while we hope for a fuller meal

venezuelan producer named this one right the track is frothy yacht-disco synth pop with a lightly faded surface like a well-thumbed photograph of a sunset its slightly melancholy the milky tone of both the synth and the plucked rhythm guitar have that effect after all this time the early 80s they evoke having gone through the stage of cultural kitsch and back through again to where it evokes a more innocent era the tune has recurred in my head a few times before i realized what it was too always a good sign the rest of the ep keeps pace is a straight up disco edit a nice two-for-one move (rather than keeping productions and edits separate as a lot of producers do) particularly with something this inviting the track never burns up its subtle working primarily off of some wispy strings vocals and keyboards and thats what keeps me returning gets remixed three times twice by toby : part 1 is a little squarer rhythmically the bass drum stomps harder underneath a squelch disguised as a snare and the tracks melodic elements are given some added depth and gloss part 2 puts the same basic elements to use under a slinkier groove with heavier dub touches than on part 1 which largely just grazed the techniques the third remix is by eddie whose congas-and-handclap fits the jazzy guitar and twilit synth part even more easily than s original
few producers are lucky enough to release a debut ep that features remixes from the likes of gerd janson and philip lauer fewer still are skilled enough for their originals to deserve equal attention but a bay area native whose first release appears here on the increasingly vital crafts swollen basement techno with a deftness that belies her inexperience on its in the way diva vocals slide across the beat imbuing her warehouse-filling synth riffs with narcotic disorientation on quoi a less booming cut that fizzes with sharp hi-hats emerson again gets playful with her samples giving us a couple of undoctored bars of french rock roll she then chops into pitch-twisted techno its pacey powerful and exhilarating emersons only weakness is in the edit both tracks are over seven minutes long and lose some of their impetus in the final third which is where tuff experience shows both takes on quoi from the spiralling disco-house arps of the mix to the snares clattering over the mixs bass are taut and nimble both are dense but are sliced into movements that build and release tension subtly compared to emersons originals with their adolescent energy theyre a touch more nuanced but as criticisms go im nit picking the ep is a promising debut from a name to watch
for longtime and cobblestone jazz fans will be manna from heaven more a portfolio than a cohesive album its eight tracks comprise an eclectic look-book styles throughout which the canadians production trademarks (meandering melodies; distinct echoes his jazz and classical musical education; artfully blended live and programmed instrumentation) are all present and correct opening three tracks could hardly be more different if it werent so loaded a term you might describe as progressive house: sparkling wide-eyed and underpinned by subtle shifts in tempo and percussive idiosyncrasies of harks back like cobblestone jazzs cromagnon man to mantronix and the haunted sci-fi soundworld early detroit electro meanwhile is deeply strange a near eight-minute lo-fi miasma slow rippling synths queasy strung-out chords and stereo-panning effects it sounds like some recently rediscovered early kosmische experiment closing title track is balearic and almost beatless covering similar ground in a grander more polished style its easy to admire: this is intelligent well-crafted music but as you plough on into (all jolly jazz-funk keys like parliament seen through a deep house filter) or (somewhat rote epic tech house) the journey begins to feel aimless even in its best moments such as a shimmering curtain tiny bleeps n bloops is far from earth shattering more fundamentally these tracks dont hang together as an album most them are new but some date back several years to jonsons days in vancouver altogether it sounds like a grab-bag uneven in tone and in quality in particular sounds more like a tentative private sketch than a fully fleshed-out idea his fans might find this fascinating for anyone else there are better entry points into jonsons catalogue
canadian duo jared simms and voytek korab aka and their eponymous label have only been around for a couple of years although theyve got their dj and party wings from as far back as the 90s theyve also apparently got something of a different taste individually all of which points to the kind of freshness that comes out in but on the other hand a lack of finesse which isnt particularly prominent on the original yet shows itself more when it permeates through to a few of the remixes lets not be too hasty: is pretty good retro electro-styled stuff its got a dark electroclash vibe: tight drums with zappy fx drawling too-cool-for-school vocals and 80s bass yes weve moved on since fischerspooner but mfr do a decent job of bringing it up to date for those of you with an addiction to acid mike s remix should satisfy for a while with a line that squelches squawks and twists with the best of em and build a moody loop which growls menacingly but before long you realise its actually harmless: it doesnt do much apart from upping pace from a plod to a march near the end good work that bit but it carries on for too long beforehand fellow canadian maher s mix similarly starts off promisingly but the inclusion of brash drums over the top of the ones that were good enough already kind of kills the slinky mood set by the quiet monobass its a shame because without them itd be idiosyncratic and tasteful what with all the little bits stuttering about parisians nomenklatur get the candles out in the cathedral for a gothic sombre affair thats powerful but a shade off being really good maybe it could do with more variation in its billowing synths or maybe just more billowing synths theres good stuff there but production standards these days being what they are these last three need the ideas to be developed well too having said that theres plenty to like in mfrs and mike s versions
kasey taylor s imprint kicks into gear with this two track release from the duo of parham ilsoe a release that featured on hernan cattaneo s renaissance release earlier this year first up is love sequence a track that is quite minimal but smooth and somewhat tasty from a-b the beats are smooth throughout as are the subtle but chunky baselines and the track somewhat delivers with subtle sounds and grooves as opposed to obvious riffs rise sequence is definitely more upbeat and forceful with its chunky drums patterns smooth baselines and melodic hooks that feature throughout a more classic progressive feel here in a release that is quite traditional in its progressive approach
its a problem that most music makers would kill to have how does a producer follow up a world-conquering club hit particularly one as distinctive robotic hypnotic dventure do you try to strike gold again by repeating yourself with a facsimile of that track or do you head in a different direction in the hope that djs will follow in the case of nyc veterans john selway and elliot lysses taub together known as the answer is to split the difference the 2009 track was one of the signature moments of the ongoing piano-house revival powered by superhooky (and monstrously huge) keyboard work; it must have been tempting to recreate the tunes magic by simply slamming out another set of pavlovian chords on the ivories and leaving it at that but such is not the case on the new dancin : the boys havent forsaken their trademark instrument entirely but for the songs original mix theyve set their way-back machine to a decade prior to piano houses 90s peak specifically to the kind of early 80s proto-house that was coming out on labels like streetwise and 4th and broadway loping electro-boogie beat killer synth bass pattern rockers revenge-style synths and fabulously party-time vocal work from great weekends cole williams its the kind of tune that would have done rthur baker proud for those craving some good ol banging keyboards theres the aptly named piano mix which sees the duo pounding out a set of well-chosen chords over a charging housed-up beat and stripped-down bass there are still plenty of 80s references some of the piano flourishes strongly allude to the era and you gotta love those ping-ponging hand claps but this will likely be the mix that gets played by the retro-avoiding crowd (for those who need things pared yet further the package features the piano mix ) is dancin as ecstatic and immediately grabbing as robotic hypnotic dventure probably not what could be but considered on its own it sure is fun
over the past year the name has become synonymous with distinctive crossbreeds of technos measured lope and the brutal geometries of grime so far in hes applied this approach to the excellent raw code with peverelist and mirror song alongside julio ashmore ut solo is where thrives whats often striking about the producers recent work is how provocatively slow it sounds sure hes always displayed a taste for empty space and a determinedly stiff sense of groove but combined with an increasingly rough workmanlike sound palette tracks like des isous and jam01 become lumbering weapons dance floor tools that bludgeon you into submission released on young glaswegian label finds at his most direct and aggressive ll the familiar sonics are in place ugly distorted kicks and claps; octave-leaping strings; armloads of sub-bass ut the track makes literal the styles debt to grime: its been described as an ode to ruff sqwads raw to the core and it shares the same galloping sense of propulsion stark on-off dynamics and eyebrow-singeing bass stabs karenn seem like a shoo-in for the remix given their similarly aggressive tendencies ut the duos remix doesnt quite reach the originals intensity preferring to stomp along to its own diabolical tune all scorched synth work and hi-end drone its a solid effort but the real hero is the original

the label headed by ra columnist jonathan lisle heads into its 5th release with a two tracker from ads with the a-side utilising the vocals of massive attack s sarah jay this release follows great outings from jacob todd and kaybee first up on the a-side is feel it too and it features the trademark sound that has already developed smooth flowing broken beats surrounded by some solid atmospheric effects and stabbing sounds the baseline throughout the track is quite solid giving it as good chunky feel as well the track gets a little more upbeat late on as swirling melodies come into the track on the flip is the deep song which as the name suggests is quite deep compared to the a-side especially with its rather large deep driving baseline the effects and sounds throughout are cutting edge and i must confess this is definitely the highlight production of the two a very nice release yet again from the imprint and it s the deep song that shines for me in this outing
is a new berceuse heroique sublabel for raw uk shit expressing a desire to return to golden-age jungle rave but with a fresh twist with this in mind the label has been shrewd in recruiting anonymous bristol producer for its debut release rt has explored a range of styles over his three-year career and done so proficiently if not always thrillingly but his best tracks betray a subtle junglist influence whether its the rolling grooves of last years tales dystopia or the metalheadz sound palette of 2013s legacy the lost and riveted the tracks here are s most original to date both contain the same base elements windswept chords loping drum tattoos and little else but theyre formed into strikingly different forms s sombre funk is freighted with melancholy while on the b-side some minor tweaks saturation on the drums a touch of dissonance to the chords gives us an apocalyptic peak-time banger there may be plenty of coal-black bristolian techno around at the moment but none of it sounds quite like this
belgian dj/producer returns to the mix compilation market with a double-pack cd that contains 37 tracks in its entirety his last mix outing 160 minutes was a mixed bag that offered up deeper explorations alongside his more upfront set material a man who has written plenty of his own material plus an array of remixes bailey has built a strong following for himself throughout europe in particular cd 1 opens with a ricardo villalobos remix of sieg uber die sonnes cleaning windows which throws some diverse portions of sound our way an automaton vocal from chardronnet keeps this quirky exercise moving with stekkreflekks from robag wruhme and his wighnomy brothers cohort duplicating their trademark jarring rippling rhythmic shuffles that sometimes stumble over each other things are ambling along nicely as guido schneider gets busy on the remix of regenschauer ; globules of metallic-synth trickling away with little breaks to allow an aphex twin windowlicker replica-in-rhythm to fracture the track dominik eulberg gets a look in with his grunting wildschweinesuhle as we are given a farmyard feel to bleepy minimal house and catapulted into a more uptempo groove courtesy of chardronnet vs afrilounge sensible rudiments of electronic sound see the mix open out into wider frequencies as our ears get some stimulation tracks from the vegetable orchestra and ray soo add a monotone touch before bailey uses half-beat juggles and 2 dollar eggs gelb to revive the momentarily lost quirkiness in-form producer trentemollers polar fridge gets us vibrating with his brazen take on surging electro we are then shadowboxing with martinez as that beat em up vocal fragment is woven under a graduated sequence of synth-noise by the time axel karakasis shows up for work with freno were definitely not locked into a predictable trench but rather involved in a good ol skirmish mathias kaden und schaffhauser throw some cheeky bouncy action our way with trentemoller getting a remix call-up by the latter its clear weve moved quite some yardage on the field of play since the game began but theres still more time left to meddle with marco its a significant point on cd1 as one feels the energy is never more apparent than at this juncture a dose of acid in my fridge from dinky gets us on a nice trip and were now floating as little truncated melodies find their way up the garden path; this 4-minute diversion indeed giving us some respite from the punchy beats of earlier der muckenschwarm gets us booting along again with some squirming squelchiness proving itself to be a malevolent yet effective update on previous electronica david k provides an intriguing take on that german-arcane sound from times of yore as we almost plunge into complete darkness now its time for a treat with a sparkling refreshment served by gabriel ananda; glitter drawing somewhat of an analogy to his 2004s sussholz with its alluring strings and chords that do in fact seem to glitter mathew jonson another in-form producer figures here with some zombie bikers who have apparently returned to terrorise your neighbourhood cd1 ends with the aptly-named the beautiful beast from max cavalerro its harmonic whirlpool of rhodes-chords recalling a time when life wasnt so complicated and our disorder is for now abated cd 2 doesnt hang about to consider how we got this far but merely pushes on with b-pitch control and paul kalkbrenners gebrunn gebrunn - so good they named it twice a female-vocal snippet intersperses with guitar-licks and murky beats before ellen alien adds her vogue with more weirded out oral wit huntemann gets the second installment moving in earnest as bailey continues to run amok with an unashamed finger in the eye to those who expect any kind of control on this dangerous liaison tom hades rocks the box with some marauding noises before scottish maestros slam hit us with some renegade electro as bailey again beat-juggles and bounces on the half-beat fires short spinbacks and also uses a stutter-effect to inject an intensity into the matter bailey uses his own bollocks (no not really) to bash our heads with more disparate noise as we begin to fear things could get ugly electryk fm gets a makeover from scan x as things take a trancey diversion off the beaten path using melodic shifts tony rohrs tested well gets us gritty as we really get down to the nuts and bolts of this mix now out in deep waters far away from the safety of land donato dozzys solid really muddies this water with some filthy acidic bass and eerie synths the little games are over and marco means business as motors sweatbox turns up the heat with a wirey piece of 909 mayhem and all the right ingredients to cause a near riot on any dancefloor novamutes ability to release avante garde techno continues and this sounds very like something you might hear from the plastikman himself tiefschwarz get a revamp from alter ego as some old-skool hardcore sounds are given a makeover; a beat-driven hi-end attack on our senses providing a brief interlude before hiroaki lizuka unleashes a monster with radiant mr varela makes an appearance as agressiva gets ruthlessly chopped with the previous track and a huge continuous spinback signals that bailey aint hanging around at all today this is bailey reverting to the more traditional techno sound that we have come to expect; the belgian showing that hes not one bit ashamed of his roots and hasnt forgotten how to energise his sets at just the right time darkcore industrial elements take over as the 65d mavericks inflict suffering in a way that is customary for someone like dave clarke neat scratch-beat-mixing launches a redhead track upon us as perfunctory components and sounds which take us back to some of cj bollands pioneering work from times gone by are woven into the mix this piece of driving euro-synth burbling techno adds a richness in texture to the sparse minimality of previous tracks on this mix as we are almost home dry and in from the storm that bailey has orchestrated secret cinema get a re-rub from contemporary genius joris voorn we begin mellowing out with some beautiful pan-asian kettledrum lilts mixed with shimmering sounds of the ocean showing that is not lost on variety the spice of life stoppage time announces that we have reached the summit after a long but rewarding climb and the vista from up here is breath-taking this is a real epic gem from guy gerber and really finishes the mix with aplomb bailey illustrating he has really put in the work in to bring us to where we are combining a polished surface with an unrelenting staccato of synths closing out the mix one cant help but feel that all this is pointing us toward the future and not a moment too soon i must admit that it took a few listens for this double mix to really sink in i had to let it marinate before i could really appreciate its flavour but i think the wait was definitely worthwhile has matured a little more by exploring new territory here with a fun approach while having the ability to hold on to what really makes him tick combining electro minimal house techno and basically everything in between this mix requires an open mind and some patience to really comprehend where bailey is coming from but i do think you will find he is coming from a very good place indeed

remember once a deluge of choice dj material the cologne powerhouses floor ready sublabel released 13 speicher 12 inches at their peak in 2007 its output has slowed to an unsteady trickle nd with releases mostly coming from german techno artists or within the kompakt extended family extra has admittedly been short of wow factor recently so on paper a split release from ostgut tons h ppner and glaswegian party starter untie is exactly the sort of intriguing (if not double take inducing) lineup extra could use right now nd while the resultant doesnt contain either artists most distinctive tracks theyre a breath of fresh air nevertheless h ppners has a hit of kompakt impresario wolfgang voigt coursing through its veins with gas style murk flowing up like muddy floodwater through otherwise squeaky clean sound design untie opens with a quasi melodic drum break that wouldnt sound out of place on an old villalobos remix ut as mallets begin tapping out a simple melody starts to settle into the shuffling sound hes known for even if (like h ppner) hes let a cool forest breeze temper his usually sweat stimulating sound
andy moor puts on his disguise as for this next release on a very busy man indeed andy has been hard at work remixing the likes of the very untalented avril lavigne to the very talented likes of radiohead and leftfield this time he is hard at work putting the finishing touches to his very own production in u don t know the man doesn t muck around as the original mix is a full on peak time progressive anthem a nicely crafted analogue rolling baseline is the main feature early on as it unites nicely with good atmosphere as well as a cavalcade of melodic undertones and patterns vocal excretions make their way into the production midway in as the track features a pretty stylish breakdown not once but twice in the track all in all this track is full of great energy but what else did you expect from moor the dub mix on the flip is definitely not to be overlooked not one to be lazy andy has made some significant changes most noticeably using a totally different type of baseline one that is not as empowering but funky nevertheless two more solid breakdowns are featured but despite this the track maintains a pretty solid flow throughout quality a very nice release here for andy moor and a release that should definitely put more central on the map
next up on the main label is a release from the duo that is stathis lazarides paul goodison they make up and their latest release was snapped up by steve lawler for this main imprint the lost children remix is up first and the track is quite intriguing to say the least it is quite smooth throughout thanks to some chunky beats a nice groovy baseline and some great sounds and melodic pads the breakdown midway is very cheeky with beats scattered then taken out making an interesting mid section until the beats come roaring back in the original mix for me doesn t have the energy that the a-side had in abundance unfortunately however it is clear to see where many of the great features of the remix came from a pretty solid release here on with the a-side in particular the highlight
i saw dj for the first time in 2014 his set brought together continental house and restrained flavours of two-step to awesome effect he presented a tougher straighter sound that was quirky yet techno-oriented when i last saw him a few weeks ago this shift in focus is mirrored in his productions 2015s not a story was high on bass but its rhythmic character was serene clean and swinging is clearly the work of the same producer but the vibe is more hostile and alien (even more so than the recent ek box 12-inches produced with katsuya sano) while head binh generally has as little as possible happening in his tunes baggss four-tracker is action-packed calling to mind the unhinged edge of bleep and electro and the wackier strains of detroit techno the title track is s outlier suggesting vulnerability through its melodies features the ubiquitous lfod filters found on and much of binhs and spacetravels productions but is buoyed by a bassline combining jaunt and menace in classic bleep fashion both sides have their merits but the b-side is more unique on starry glints filtered cymbals and a woah-ing mid-range make for a nuanced mixture so the sizeable dosage of bass is the cherry on top has a similar sound palette but the simple recurring pitch shift of the bassline keeps it packed with urgency while keen followers of labels like will recognise s constellation of references theres still a fine line between pastiche and a genuine article this 12-inch is an on-point case of the latter
why stick to the things that ive already tried asks noah lennox aka panda bear on pantha du princes latest single its not meant in earnest though it rather nicely explains what hes up to here: trying out something new not that this affair is wholly without precedent: bear and prince have crossed paths before when pantha served up a stunning remix of a track called peacebone by this band that noahs in called animal collective as a singer lennox revels in collage layering and manipulating himself using voice as an instrument but never allowing technique to trump expression on lennoxs breakthrough solo record person pitch his voice keeps its forthright honesty and simple beach boys tones no matter how its being twisted treats you to the full panda and pantha tag-team with catchy brian wilson pleas and haunting bells over minimal beats and while it works for the most part it feels above all like an experiment: at times inspired at times teetering a bit on the novelty of hybrid form that said if indie kids and techno kids listen in closely theyll hear a blueprint for future genre-smashing the tracks experimental quality leaves ample room for dial friends to crowd in and go to work and the results speak well of all involved the standout arguably is four s version which displays a loose house-y groove not that far off from his recent love cry single the addition of phased-out drums twinkling keys and upbeat bass along with touches of the emotive pitch-bent synth and anthemic bursts of vocals seems to occlude a bit of the vaguely mash-up-like quality at work in the original feeling quite fleshed out and proud it could be a single in itself monsieur shows up twice to the party flying solo he offers a clubby roller that effectively berlinizes the tune and together with carsten offers a detriot-tinged spook-out that seems like its receding down some infinite nightclub corridor cast in shadow and neon with vocals left in mournful shreds lawrences ears are tuned attentively to those beautiful bells ah those bells over a spare shuffling drum kit he lets them ring out in space alongside a lovely palette of xylophonic ring and sonorous clank walls takes the opposite path yielding a church-a-pella a beatless and cosmic display of lennoxs pipes in boy-choir glory swathed on either side by heavenly ambient ripple its the sunday mass mix sunlight through stained glass
if like more militant labels and organisations you view techno as an ongoing struggle between genuine and opportunistic n marks a massive victory for real producers while id be wary of subscribing to such a creed re is no doubt that this eponymous debut ep is a hugely impressive work the author has spent an inordinate amount of time and effort listening to and seeking to recreate drexciyas e real electro but on closer examination its clear that convextions sensuous melodies and rhythmic complexities as well as cinematic ambience of sadly absent detroit escalator co project have also left ir mark on spooky electronic textures unfold recalling stinson-donald partnership but pulsing bass pushes arrangement to a place that house and disco djs will also appreciate goes deeper featuring glacial chords yet fluid acid pulses keep track dance floor-bound by time melancholy synths of appear however releases slide towards an introspective place is in train this mood is also evident on menacing low end gurgles and mysterious atmospherics of and while low-slung jack of marks a slight return to floor its execution is so mysterious and evocative that one quickly forgets about backing the black-hoodie wearing militia will claim that machines marks a victory for underground against soulless dross but irrespective of your viewpoint re is no doubt that is a lovingly-crafted effortlessly beautiful release

is the latest project from musical miscreant and classic co-boss luke solomon it sees him team up with journeying guitarist andy neal to craft something a world away from his last outings on say fullbarr or crosstown the dance floor hasnt been ditched entirely you can certainly still get down to these in the right context but gone are all traces of house techno and electronic repetition in place of lazy but strident dub tempos big licking guitar riffs and woody instrumental funk doused in reverb and echo great sweeping guitars open with a truly gravelly resonance a fluttering harmonica then displaces you somewhere in the uss deep south while more twanging guitar notes ping about with all the rawness of contemporary cult blues hero seasick steve is similar in its gauzy guitar density and sluggish nu-disco tempo but this time you could imagine the track fitting into an unreleased version of pink floyds dark side of the moon for its lead solos gaunt vocals and proggy undercurrent is much lighter rumbling along on ramshackle lines of drums guitars horns and no doubt many other indecipherable instruments not so daniele s remix of the italian disco king punctures his version with a spaceships lasers beams brings the kick drum to the fore and strips the soul of the original vocal away to leave something much sleazier in its wake fans of timothy j fairplay andrew weatherall or trentemoller will certainly enjoy this one

from its ception editions megos impr t has been anyth g but predictable releas g everyth g from gnarled noise and neo-kosmische post-techno and italian prog but even that assortment is little preparation for s as its experiments pop bubblegum mark a wholly new step for the label is the project of toko yasuda an artist whos been volved with several die-friendly groups not least among them blonde redhead and enon although an electronic record at its core is more about pop songs than the labels trademark experimentalism sound on offer is a sort of style-mishmash dance-pop that seems almost a typically japanese take it f ds easy association with an array of movements and artists from the last two decades from shibuya-kei pixeltan at the same time it slots nicely next the contemporary likes of heatsick (especially on the low-slung funk of the title track) and 100 silk how it clearly doesnt take itself o seriously while retro-lean g f ds yasuda all over the map goes for dreamily lethargic balearic-lean g downtempo with a saxophone even emerg g at one po t roll g on the other hand has a k d of urban freneticism that recalls out hud it really comes a head its f al section as yasudas stretched moan echoes out over a hyperactive landscape if anyth g dissolves the disparities between these tracks its their underly g sample patchworks which range from telephone sounds animal noises a spoken passage about the north w d and yasudas alternatively un telligible and quirky lyrics her voice is very fey and accented but may or may not semi-rhyme krispy kreme with whiskey irish cream and the chorus of is the puzzl g you are the one that im th k g of on some level these l es must make sense yasuda or anyone with a lyric sheet but as they are they contribute a lot the records addictive jumble may stutter and step like a robot on meth but regardless of its idiosyncratic terior or what shes actually s g g its ludicrously catchy and a perfect hallmark for such a confus gly fectious record
the 2013 blue gardens album on keysound recordings was the last release from londons e m m a its where we really got to know her warm colorful and synth-rich post-dubstep sound she hasnt been completely inactive in the interim as she shares the regular angel food show on radar radio with aimee cliff e m m a s return to production is essentially one new track so its hard to gauge her development since 2013 but releasing on a net-focussed label suggests some kind of shift e m m a s signature sound is still a rippling arpeggiated synth but glac feels less aligned with the club than her earlier tracks she opts for rock drums reverb gated snares and the kind of bassline that puts her in the realm of john carpenter it feels like a shift towards the cinematic and away from blue gardens uk bass iglews atmospheric remix is a great companion as is the beatless mix the ep shows a tidy progression through a central theme and is an intriguing palette cleanser for whats to come from e m m a
ena and felix k were practically made for each other both got their start in drum bass and approached the genre sideways becoming standouts in the process and theyve both since moved on from 170 bpm dance music felix k used his prolific label to zig-zag down all sorts of avenues while ena settled into the samurai label family touching on techno ambient and modular experiments the two artists first came together under the name 943 for a 12-inch of left-leaning techno and now theyve regrouped as flxk1 ena for a longer more cerebral session oscillates between heads-down tinkering and broken wheezing dance music with the wandering focus of a private jam session when the two work up a beat like on the tunnelling c1 or spellbinding opener it often feels tenuous as if the drums might fall into the foggy abyss below you can picture them furrowing their brows as they try to wring something recognizable from the equipment the duo is at their best when tapping into something that feels completely alien like the trippy sonar pings in b1 or the halloween spookiness of c2 ena and k create textures that range from earthy to ethereal sometimes all in the same track the more obscure moments here might only appeal to gear heads or experimental music fans while the beat-oriented tracks have a dreary sway thats for sinking into instead of dancing the music is more in line with felix ks blackest ever black ep or enas divided series is equally intriguing a chance to hear two crafty innovators put their heads together and see what bizarre shit they can come up with
release code : dor031 the label praises itself on quality and this release is no exception the name is the moniker for none other than the hong kong based dan f from disuye records who have currently been stirring the break beat world with some amazing futuristic productions and this is no exception side a: original mix firstly youll notice this tracks baseline - it seems to warm and relax the mind and is the perfect beginning right from this start you just know this track is going to be a great relaxing/chill-out type of progressive sound and with the title it is definitely appropriately named the track features some very nice effects which give the tune a really futuristic and techy edge its not the easiest of sounds to describe but give it a listen as its quality and i love it side b: spincycles midnight growler remix you know from the kick-off that this track is something unique its interesting baseline takes you into the track and added too it is some very light techy sounds that take you for a bit of a drive the track is very different not really classifiable as percussion or tech-house when a track is not really classifiable yet it is one of total quality a lot of the time it ends up being something special and this track is one of them spincycle s mix has apparently already made it in with the cooler crowds in london and its easy to see why give it a listen - its not for everyone but it is definitely for some overall a great vinyl something fairly different and cutting edge which has a really great vibe about it
we all know the drill: a tune gets made then shared among the producers circle of dj friends and associates this happens right across dance music within the crews of hot creations and innervisions through to outfits surrounding hessle audio perlon and [a:rpia:r] then a few months or even years down the line the track in question might get a proper release but theres no formula for deciding what ends up on wax in minimalist dance music some of the hottest unreleased tracks seem unlikely to ever come out while others hit shelves just months after being debuted at a party s appearing on his three-track ep is one of the bombs were lucky enough to get our hands on relatively quickly a few top-tier romanians rinsed it for much of last year: petre inspirescu played it at sunwaves 17 and rhadoo opened his set with it at nus festival in croatia a few months later its easy to see why it stood out among the more abstract unreleased material that inspirescu and his friends play its crisp and delightfully functional with a bright and spacey aesthetic based around splashes of catchy melody its joined by and two more low-slung cuts that are similarly groovy but darker but if youre the kind of dj who plays stuff like theyre bound to come in handy
is the debut vinyl release on records and the first solo release from themselves since 2013s kikkerkelik for vlek that ep leaned towards conventional house and techno gestures albeit conventional by the standards of the oddball belgian scene the trio inhabits by contrast presents a subtler and considerably stranger sound on tranquille gitflo synth pads pool like light cool and weightless while fragments of voice dance through at irregular intervals the whole thing never really goes anywhere without ever quite staying still the rest of the ep is similar complex and fluid in a way which suggests weve stumbled on some rich hidden ecosystem is sparser its single synth line teetering unsteadily over weighty percussion +quarry s pushes the trios sound towards the druggiest corners of the berghain dancefloor like everything on this ep the transformation is carried out with the subtlest of tweaks a foggy drone here a wash of hi-hats there but that doesnt make it any less compelling
given his track record it would be fair to assume that any ep jamal moss green lights for release on his mathematics label doesnt consist of conformist flavour of the month dross of proves that moss hasnt changed his stance produced by ostensibly a relative newcomer but thanks to discogs and myspaces identity forming capabilities we may never know for sure flits between a range of underground house styles sometimes even within the space of the same track napoletano provides a sublime opener with seductive guidance/ -style jazz house on the title track then revisits classic heard deepness with the resonating bass and raw beats of planeta on del napoletano looks to jazz influences again but this time the riffs are spacier the beats lazy and lopsided and the overall feeling one of reckless abandon but the same warm production feeling applies while the discordant bleeps of mici are the only weak link in the release jamal mosss remix of cida as is the wackiest track more conventional than his recent double-pack what isnt moss starts with a typically gritty jacking arrangement however pretty soon hes introducing eerie oriental stabs ghoulish synth lines both of which are eventually subsumed as the underlying acid bleeps mutate into an unstoppable wave of ferocious acid excess weird and often quite wonderful
electronic musics fixation with science fiction has always been there and probably always will be james clements is an old hand in this regard with his futuristic music often using the power of depth to achieve an immersive pull following a memorable collaboration with ulrich schnauss and launching his diode imprint last month the san diego-based brit delivers three typically cinematic productions for londons is the eps toughest inclusion two frenetically paced drum loops clash before sweeping synths and vessel-like pulses are introduced title track is more of a soundscape lit by droning chords and twinkling chimes while is a dubbier cut reminiscent of g-stones output in the late 90s those who follow will already know he doesnt trade in mediocrity se tracks arent career-highs but theyre still finely crafted additions to his catalogue
s entry into fabrics famed mix series comes at an unfortunate time iconic club has been shuttered its staff laid off leaving future of london nightlife seemingly endangered by developers government authorities and those who think of nightclubs as a haven for degenerates real name paul rose recently moved back to london and was last dj to play at fabric and none of unfortunate events had unfolded when he handed in yet its impossible to listen to his mix without se events in mind rose has used 42 tracks in a mix that runs about 75 minutes building dense rhythmic constructions out of minimal dj tools as though he viewed objekts kern vol as a challenge artfulness and complexity of can be seen as a riposte towards those who seek to belittle dance music and club culture as mindless fun while also serving as a functional summary of a night in room stead of cramming toge r se 42 tracks with a breakneck mixing style most sections are essentially mashups of two to four different cuts various rhythmic elements are teased in and out before rose moves into ano r cluster of productions unless youve somehow heard all of this music (which includes currently unreleased hotflush records from newcomers like and ) simply following along with tracklist is difficult to say nothing of actually mixing it its easy to imagine rose toying around in ableton on long haul flights piecing toge r se rhythmic monsters like a jigsaw puzzle rose has had a varied journey in dance music he explored connections between dubstep and techno with his sub:stance residency at berghain tried his hand at poppy big room tracks and n dipped back into ominous atmospheres with 2015s claustrophobia though bursting at seams with new club music is far more restrained than s dj kicks rose now sounds interested in subtle melodic textures and interplay between tough minimal dj tools short hes not looking for big hooks or easy hands in air moments early in mix he uses mike servitos reshape of s but ra r than dropping in yazoo style synth that defines track he only snatches intros slamming drums while lo fi inclusions from labels like opal tapes and l a club resource may raise some eyebrows likes of s with its dubbed out synth stabs reminiscent of levon vincents late jam fit right in res often a rhythmic formula at work too when chain rattle percussion of s enmeshes with disembodied two step of s its like north london meeting his berlin counterpart in a dark alley all of extra effort has paid off: is a killer dance mix first a technical exercise second pent up strings on truncates remix of s perfectly set stage for s shift out of s into s unreleased is a basic filter sweep mix that could be done with any setup like finale of a fireworks show mixs final 15 minutes are stunning mashes his exclusive deep techno track into s consumers before introducing funkiest bassline on from y set stage for a beautiful four part ending that includes cinematic s jazzy downtempo take on by las s propulsive and a snippet from s 80s gay porn soundtracks rose ends his painstaking mix with a flourish accomplishing his goal of exploring a dizzying set of moods and rhythms while hovering around 128 bpm that deceptively low key showmanship was made possible by years rose has spent playing and listening watching dancers at clubs like now quiet farringdon institution
few did rolling low-slung house better than the swiss duo dished out a string of records between 2006 and 2010 each pushing dubby side-long minimal workouts rinsed by everyone from reboot to ricardo villalobos the house landscape was different back then groove and functionality reigned supreme with german institutions like get physical oslo and mobilee ranking among dance musics most popular imprints landed on the classier end of that summer-friendly loop-based spectrum though its hard to see the project gaining similar traction if it debuted today the glory days of this sound are long gone which makes the arrival of a new record all the more intriguing its impossible to tell whether the two tracks on were produced recently or left over from the late 2000s both are cut from the same cloth as all previous releases long bass-heavy and rolling each one is testament to the musics enduring dj appeal though both sides have a distinct mood 011 2 is bright and positive thanks to snappy drums dreamy chord stabs and a catchy female vocal snippet the a-side is darker and more stripped-back focusing on a loud bubbling bassline its a handy cut to have when working with a full dance floor and importantly a good soundsystem

alexander williams better known as is the voice behind modern house hits like benediction and infinity versatile and loaded with personality his vocals are distinct his lyrics less so he has a tendency towards tired clich s and awkward turns of phrase last years hot natured album showed how it can all go wrong i wasnt sure what to expect from p u m p his third solo album and the first since his rise to popularity his own williams gets willfully weird which means that even when p u m p falls flat on its face (which it does) its rarely less than entertaining williams starts the record off in fine form is as solid as this stuff gets a flamboyant -style jam with a killer chorus and clever lyrics but then hits wildly off the mark a lame attempt at punk-funk with call-and-response lyrics that drive it into the ground ( youre gay / i dont care / work it ) record struggles to recover from there a plodding meander called runs into p u s s y (where williams pledges pussy is all that i dream of ) then stumbles into a spoken-word monologue that makes him sound like a prince impersonator p u m p weaves between extremes so much it might give you whiplash p u s s y is followed by which could be the silkiest track yet a cocksure strut in the grand tradition of hall oates its fuzzy synth chords make up for its slightly creepy lyrics in terms of quality its so far ahead of everything else here that it barely sounds like it belongs on the same album n again p u m p isnt the most coherent record it winds down with a deeply weird saga that could be described as conspiracy theory techno is just what you think it is feeding into astral orientalism ( ) before closing with the confident collaboration a track so light and fluffy it sounds like its made of clouds all of those tracks sit next to which could have been spat from a song generator and the contemplative an instrumental with a welcome streak of subtlety at times impressive and at others cringeworthy p u m p shows to be more eccentric than hes let on in the past in a world of complacent tech house at least hes trying something new
are a uk 4-piece act comprised of 3 vocalists tamara cabba and nick with the beats and songwriting duties taken care of by anu pillai basing their sound around a healthy dose of electro there couldnt have been a better choice for a name other than freeform as they embrace a wide range of styles including house hip hop rock punk and techno is their first mixed compilation and showcases the freeform sound when they dj live as a bonus theyve included a remix cd where they remix some of dance and pops biggest names plantlife who impressed us all with their straight out of left field release the return of jack splash get the mix into gear with the last song dropping a stomping 4/4 electro beat psychedelic synth work with politically charged vocals freeform then pull off a remix of their own magnetic dropping rock guitars electro b-boy breaks and wobbly basslines with vocals performed by uk garage mc lyric l providing the base sample for daft punks robot rock breakwaters release the beast is a fine example of disco rock meets electro and this was done back in 1980 some music was definitely ahead of its time and this one is a perfect example skatta and kanesha karats send one out to all the ladies with all the ladies looking naughty and this gets blended in with tough electro breaks from kangos stein massivs eddik freeform then unearth another old skool classic in the form of funkadelics in the cabin of my uncle jam giving up a classic disco vibe which then gets the acapella of mr vegas pull up mixed on top those who are familiar with pitbulls culo single (which mr vegas appeared on) will easily recognise the vocal hook representing one of electros biggest labels crosstown rebels is the crocodile by wax featuring a massive arpeggio-like synth line which changes melody as the tune progresses and electro synth bass - this one has a lot of bite - with bounty killers vocal from eeeeaaooww getting placed on top freefrom then mix in a couple of remixes done of freeform 5 tunes such as the jackson remix of break me which takes electro back to the days when it was mostly synth based and loaded with arpeggios the paul woodford remix of what do i want from you goes on another stomping 4/4 ride with dirty bass arpeggio stabs and a disctinct punk chic feel the mix then moves onto a couple of dancefloor oriented rock tunes in the form of pink greases the pink g r ease is gonna make you sweat and soulwaxs (taking time off from their 2 many djs alterego) ny excuse - tunes that are recieving plays on both mainstream radio and the dancefloor mainly for their resiliance to not be locked down into a certain genre and provide something fun for the dancefloor although it can get really annoying its hard not to see the effect that roman flugels gehts noch has on the dancefloor with house electro and breaks djs all playing the tune in its various incarnations aphex twins windowlicker - the tune with the crazy video of booty hos wearing ugly faced masks with the main character dancing like michael jackson - gets mashed up with this and in a way makes gehts noch sound so much better the remix cd features 9 freeform 5 takes of classic tunes and begins with an old remix they did of isolees beau mot plage back in 2000 on derrick carters classic house label this one is certainly different from the freeform 5 we know today as it features a jazzier and funkier house vibe loaded with latin percussion jazzy flutes and a massive bongo and steeldrum beatdown in the middle lazy by x-press 2 is quite possibly one of the biggest tunes to come out in 2002 especially with talking heads david byrne on vocals freeforms take on lazy is anything but lazy and quite possibly one of the best versions i have heard incorporating an uplifting beat with that all-important aspect of percussion feel-good horn arrangements and a wicked bass line elton john is one artist who i would have never expected to fall under the surgical knife of freeform but it seems like nothing is safe from ff5 are you ready for love gets turned into a poppy house tune loaded with lots of electro hooks and a catchy bassline pretty poppy but since when is anything from elton not targeted to the pop market ff5 then pull off a remix of mylos musclecar with the ff5 vocalists adding their own vocals to the remix namechecking various american musclecar names and brands felix da housecats rocket ride gets slowed down and ff5 incorporate classic electro elements into their remix not to mention a wicked disco breakdown in the middle utilising disco guitar licks and disco beats what is awesome about the mix is that the tunes are blended together quite deeply and each tune fits in quite well with the following tune the acappellas that are thrown in add to the variety whilst not making the mix sound too busy as some mixes are known for the remix cd on the other hand gives listeners a sample of what ff5 are all about when they translate other artists tunes in their own eyes full length too so that djs can finally grab that illusive copy theyve been searching for
radioheads thom yorke likes to do things his own way so it seems fitting that the debut release from his group toms for the unlikely partnership between yorke and the red hot chili peppers bassist flea aided by producer nigel godrich and veteran session musicians joey waronker and mauro refosco would be somewhat unconventional in this case it means kicking off the bands catalog with a pair of remixes the side cut is a remix of nimals a downcast piano led song by oklahomas of the original song only the voice and the gloomy mood remain; the rework is based on a brooding bass synth that sounds like the saddest sleng teng in the world with keening pads and percussive flutter suggestive of early utechre the songs back half meanwhile sounds like recent four tet with bright tones perforated by scratchy clatter on the side toms for remix their as yet unreleased track gain four tet (or possibly luke bbott) offers the closest reference point as gently swinging bass arpeggios go burbling along beneath looped voices jittery tambourine and a flicker of organ despite its slightly restless movement a sense of calm prevails in this quixotic little song

as - samuel van dijk belongs to a venerable collection of dutch artists pursuing a refined modern vision for electro but compared to say the better-known delta funktionen the world of - is particularly dark and strange with tracks often so subtle as to be intimidating its worth making the effort to get acquainted as this nicely sequenced six-tracker for delta funktionens label demonstrates -118as productions have rarely sounded grottier than : the beats are chunky and crumple on impact the swooshes of synth fx clouded with noxious reverb the title track thuds balefully along near to 120 bpm cool minor-key melodies and a few string chords wafting slowly out of the murk weightier still is which whips itself up to a pungent climax if anything van dijk gets a little lost in the fog sacrificing some of the delicacy that marks out his best tracks blasts out the cobwebs thanks partly to its elevated speed and partly to its melodies some artful lead-lines and a terse midrange arp make it the eps most accessible moment from there van dijk strips things back is more or less just drums though its the most disorientating drum track youll hear in a while closer din is an electro loop as heard from inside a reverb chamber not much happens across its three-minute length but in -118as nocturnal world small events take on spooky significance
a while jonny white and kenny lasgow were on top of the game without you scored them one of the biggest house music hits in recent memory and helped them lead crosstown rebels to world domination circa 2010 but like most artists who establish a formula slumped into diminishing returns: uninspired sets and a disappointing follow up lp started their decline n a few months ago lasgow announced his departure from leaving white to carry on as a solo act is whites first move since taking responsibility for the project on the surface it looks like a reboot digging through sounds less obvious than the usual crosstown rebels and no 19 music fare tracklist is surprising to say the least previous mix cds featured the likes of fuckpony jamie jones and deniz kurtel; here we get underground newcomers like and plus dusty house favorites and fred p (who appears twice) as if to hammer the point home the hiss of s bookends fabric82 a flashing sign that this mix is meant to be a serious statement despite s associations with druggy party music as transparent as the move may be is a fine mix on its own terms and retains a few hallmarks we already knew white had an ear for throbbing basslines and they form the core of this cd starting with the deep heartbeat of s from there coasts through a strong opening section which includes a killer cut and works up a froth going into efdemins earwormy remix of kickin by its a seamless build familiar from s days as a premier tech house act whites mixing is as youd expect plain and patient re are some particularly nice moments that allow the best tracks to shine without interrupting the mixs steady flow fred ps knotty remix of s et is gradually overtaken by the wobbly whooshes of rooves 2 0 the boundary between the two collapses entirely to make a simple but satisfying blend other fred p appearance a remix of floats nicely into s dreamy before slams things back into high gear on classy selections aside little of is inventive new wrinkles can be found in the quality and imagination of the music itself but otherwise its all put together with the same low slung style that established long ago result is a mix that doesnt work as a reboot so much as a re examination its the sound of a long running dance act working to get itself back on track
theres something old-fashioned about s debut ep for lets play but for once its not old-fashioned house rather has an am gold vibe with clean melodies and group vocal lines its not often you hear harmonies like this on a deep house tune theyre complemented by a warm bassline that hugs the vocals without dominating the track uses garage-style cut-ups instead placing them alongside kitschy saxophone snippets and breezy organs recalling a different era of vintage altogether fellow swedes shakarchi slow it down to a more disco pace reveling in the newfound space by warming up the bassline and drenching the other elements in delay but its young who has the star turn with his no-holds-barred take on completely disregarding the chilled-out soul of the original the dutchman ties the bassline to the kick drum to make it a stomper and once the high-pitched lead comes in its game over pecking out a sing-song melody thatll make you forget the original even existed
sleeve of s latest p shows a photo of her as a 13-year-old beauty queen (she apparently did everything not to win including not entering the talent section but won anyway ) for the new york-based producer its a funny reminder of an embarrassing experience she tends to look back on 80s and 90s dance music more affectionately and these four tracks inspired by 90s rave are no different in places sounds more sure of itself than foxmans past ps on the label she started in 01 some of those records including her last p its you that drives wild oscillated between pop and house unsure of which sound to commit to and unable to reconcile them and are hybrid tracks that nod to k acid house and trance featuring buoyant melodies and in the formers case a churning 303 yre sometimes too faithful of a tribute some moments sound quite dated but its not enough to make them uninteresting foxmans music much like her singing tends to be airy and sweet but has a conspicuous bite lectricity best combines her silky vocals with this newfound snap when she sings you make me feel good the reverb gives her words a chilly detachment music has generous melodic elements gliding synths nuzzling acid a classic house bassline but no part outmuscles the others res also a nice balance to where gassy synths and off-key mallet percussion spool into a noirish mood when it explores foxmans darker side shines
over the course of a few years vaporwave shot off in a number of directions a once digital-only label that now releases cassettes and vinyl has helped steer it towards sweeping cinematic sounds and away from simple slowed-down loops label boss hke now calls their style dream music a world of distant voices soft-focus ambient textures and soaring melodies hkes collaboration with t e l e p a t h has been one of the most powerful proponents of this sound project started out as an attempt to make vaporwave without samples a repudiation of the genres foundation s self-titled album did a fine job of that in 2014 last years reissued by not not fun pointed towards bigger ideas pulling in more instrumentation to create something that felt epic and unguarded hindsight was a stepping stone to ill-advised chinese and japanese references are gone replaced by an imaginary world informed by the subconscious music is unlike anything hke or t e l e p a t h have done before s tracks move gradually each one unfurling like fractal patterns through their 80-minute journey the duo touch on dramatic breakbeat ( ) 4 d goth atmospheres (the vocal-driven ) sigur r s-style post-rock ( ) and beyond one moment in particular illustrates the leap hke and t e l e p a t h have made from their past music combines trip-hop and shoegaze into a bleary daze like the entranced overloaded feeling you get from staying up too late staring at a screen listen to the first release hkes and youll hear how much has changed that music was a solid entry into an established vaporwave tradition slowing down chunks of songs until they sounded otherworldly two and a half years later 2184 has made an album of powerful instrumentation towering melody and a creatively imagined world if is driving vaporwave forward is the first major landmark along the way

with an ep out right now on visionquest another forthcoming on wolf + lamb and here on italian label life and theres a danger that san fran trio could be spreading themselves thin that said theres enough musicality and invention here to suggest they could whore themselves to even more labels and still come up with the goods brainchild of ryan williams michael tello and sammy d have soul at their core here they shuttle back and forth across associated genres lead track stitches together avalanches-style northern soul handclaps and drum fills with sammys doo wop vocals before magically shifting forward four decades as an 808 arrives on the scene somewhat implausibly it ends up as a burbling menacing tech house tune next twinkling instrumental with its simple rhodes keys motifs and banks of congas is bathed in a balearic sheen on the flip (for vinyl buyers naturally) uses burial-like muted tom toms a simple three-note analogue synth refrain and some elegant intricate pads around which build a melancholic house shuffle with sammys double-tracked vocals to the fore label head manfredi romano teams up with tale of us for a subtler yet tougher (percussively speaking) reworking of its really rather lovely a moodier early hours (digital-only) re-rub of by tale of us daubs the original with minimal-style keyboard throbs rumbling bassline and a heads-down groove in sum theres a heck of a lot to like here
given the spotlight on the in-form martyn the unwavering interest in the relentless invention of surgeon as well as the high regard for s source material this release suffers a little from the weight of expectation nd while it hardly disappoints it falls just short of having the final edge necessary to exceed the sum of its parts surgeons remix begins forcefully enough with thick analogue bass and whipping high end percussion that leaves no room for air however their combined rapid pace and choking density seems almost too fast and too heavy for the atmospherics which are left to toil half-strangulated in the background this converts the originals soothing ethereal glides into a spooky horror soundtrack without some of the requisite suspense organic messy and t++-esque surgeons mix is complicated and fascinating but it can also seem like two tracks playing at once rather than a unified whole martyns remix on the other hand is far more integrated emphasis lies on s original mischievous melody with a typically crispy martyn beat served up front in the mix in place of the originals low lying scratchy rhythms of more variable success is a vocal sample repeating the title which ranges from being a little overused to adding to the playfulness rest of the mix is however pure class with martyns arrangements and attention-to-detail second to none
not surprisingly noah nthonys inaugural 12-inch under his moniker is geared more towards dance floor demands than his stridently exploratory debut album come follow me (released just a month prior) the release sees the producer jettisoning the noise and drone aspects of his sound concentrating instead on combining classic e m and modern dark techno of the plates two tracks its that most exudes e ms brooding muscularity moreover its base components (military march-n-shuffle iridescent strings chunky synth jabs lurching bass) are straight-up monolithic yet the crafty ways in which nthony manipulates each ones textural character allows them to gel gracefully into a throbbing heaving industrial symphony-in-miniature particularly arresting is the decay-verses-growth contrast between the kick colossal if crumbly always flirting with implosion and those strings which blossom into dub-drenched fractals comes replete with hyper-brittle hand claps silkily automated oscillations whiplash snares and teutonic murmurings that would make d f s gabi delgado-l pez proud s the track progresses it mutates from icy monochrome to luxuriant technicolor with throwback lasers (as well as a clutch of sweetly flavored synth-effects imported from italo) multiplying and darting about the soundscape marks as a name to be reckoned with one who deserves mentioning alongside fellow dystopian heavies vatican shadow and silent servant
while its fair to say that he faces stiff competition in his native holland home to legowelt i-f rachmad delsin and rush hour is clearly among one of europes most overlooked producers covering bases as diverse as stomping techno to soulful ny-themed garage with room in between to craft classics like fix voorn has been quietly putting out killer dance music for the best part of decades without any hype the first release on divine finds voorn in mellow soulful form the title track is a languid dubby affair propelled by a warm warbling bass that recalls classic derrick may tracks like icon available in three excellent versions also looks back in time to mid 90s us house as s velvety vocal tones and as always is a talker rather than a singer are combined with heavy drums subtle disco filters while replicating that distinctively dreamy production sound at which prescription used to excel given the tone of the release the inclusion of is a surprise set to a stripped back jack track highly reminiscent of a rap hit youll no doubt recognize an unidentified man whispers the kind of pre-carnal sentiments to vocalist shorty one that would make a porn star blush her response please come hurt me daddy/ baby girl is oh so ready/ be used and abused/ now beat my pussy up until its bruised to the sound of pre-orgasmic female moans like i said: voorn s music is nothing if not diverse

lorenz brunner hasnt moved far beyond the ideas on his most recent records placid and think twice draws heavily on the sparse arrangements and modest tempos of the former and the poignant reverb-soaked synths of the latter the two tracks here have plenty in common too: begins immediately where s desolate tech house leaves off with the same gnarled bass frequencies lurking under its 4/4 thuds such blatant connections make come off like an elongated intro for the more fleshed-out b-side t least is a decent take on brunners brooding dance music with trembling trance melodies flooding the greyscale atmosphere and simplistic beat theres a lot of interesting motion from the synths as they jump twist and hide in the empty space around the drums but to be sure little about hasnt been done to death not least by brunner by himself which depletes any lingering power from the formula fter the resounding impact hotflush and made together with 2014s caldera these tracks are more like drops in a very large pond
im always struck by how unhinged sounds: jackhammer bass brittle drums and other detritus fly toward you at a rate that feels well beyond responsible his productions many dating back to the ron hardy days are certainly rough around the edges ut djs know theres no substitute for the sort of ass-shaking his tracks encourage making his discography among the most expensive youre likely to come across on the collectors market thus when a new set of tracks drops its best not to sleep nd luckily for you luv the latest snag for nknown to the nknown is another excellent addition to the producers kookily timeless oeuvre skewing toward the more jackin (and admittedly perverse) end of the universe the two tracks on offer here slot perfectly with the sort of deranged party vibe tt has been cultivating of late on low mixxs unrelenting blown-out drum machines and what sounds like bass guitar rub shoulders with altered female vocals and weirdly sinister cat meows less grandma-friendly yet musically more subtle luv sees little wisps of piano-driven melody seep through an otherwise impenetrable jackathon though caked in grime and maybe a little silly these tracks still sound fresh and dance floors are likely to take these wily grooves quite seriously

s debut 7-inch contains both promise and limitation s their cheekily inverted name suggests nicholas kuceli and james dalgliesh (both refugees from death-twangers slug guts) specialize in synth-punk inspired by genre pioneers suicide yet its synth-punk also filtered through the analog pulse-n-fizz explored in the early days of post-punk by cabaret voltaire spk d f etc the result is a pair of densely constructed songs and woozy zone-out that belie the duos flair for methodically recombining their myriad influences nd hell it doesnt hurt that dalglieshs vocals monotone and hollow sound super cool and catchy while wallowing in narcotized desolation yet this historical m lange also means are beholden to specific retro impulses that in recent years have reached saturation levels in the underground from the current downwards stable to most of the sacred ones roster to the still-growing legion of minimal wave revivalists the sheer number of musicians obsessed with vintage post-punk is getting excessive in order to better distinguish themselves from the glut might consider updating their synth-punk attack with ideas unique to our current era if for example dalgliesh and kuceli could find a way to harness the maximalist dynamics explored by progressive heavies such as sightings wolf eyes or even will over matter then they very well could make that critical leap from the nostalgic to the truly modern
has received a lot of praise over his last few outings on yoshitoshi and shinichi with some very fine releases including the brilliant beneath the surface ep here we see get his turn on the new label yo with a remix coming from the very talented the greek who has been featured heavily on the latest deep dish global underground the main mix is a superbly crafted production of solid beats and emotive elements from the outset the mix takes you into some unique percussion with the vocal making its presence felt early as the mix drives onward the beat double kicks giving it that extra kick and makes way for the very smooth guitar sounding melody and light hit hats keeps it simply and minimal giving the different elements their time to make an impact as the whole feeling deepens with atmospheric synths while the vocal shows up sporadically the breakdown utilizes the early percussion then the swirling sounds flood over taking it back in to the groove that is then cut short by another breakdown of similar fashion no guessing what happens after that the greek remix has a little more up and go with driving beats from the start while accompanied by the reworking of the melody the stabbing chords are quite uplifting as the vocal spreads across the beat as the mix is added with more deepening synths and sounds the breakdown lowers the bass slowly as a gorgeous epic guitar lead breakdown is spine chilling while the vocal is scattered slowly the build to the beat is fantastic as the synths return to make even more hairs stand on end and more driving beats are forced to the surface the track rounds out with all the melodies coming in from everywhere this is a very solid release from and the remix from the greek has probably got the jump on the original but both together are class
s fourth appearance on phil the limited-run vinyl-only label owned by philogresz feels oddly dated his brand of intricately detailed deep house littered with fleeting piano licks and percussive trills channels the mid-00s microhouse of freude am tanzen where basses are chunky and samples flicker in and out each close-micd and almost too sharply in focus both originals centre on an agile sub each note offset slightly against the kick so the tracks move with a mild limp hinters proved himself apt at the deep house tear-jerker tracks like better life and take care had that stimming-like blend of texture and melody but in both and programming takes sole precedence but whether its the formers metallic clangs or the latters organic drums and horns both are too clinical to make an impact beyond an appreciation of their complexity the remixes however take a different approach torontos basic unit hacks away at s sheen with rusty drums and dissolves the piano riff in a bubbling acid squelch its as though hes held up a fairground mirror to the original and each element is reflected back bulbous and uncanny philgoreszs take on is more sympathetic extending the original features rather than breaking them the synths become warped pads the toms are wrapped in echo to fashion something far more substantial
returns for part two of his ep on with two brand new productions from the talented uk producer lokitas is first up and it showcases the smooth house side of luke s work thanks to a very tasty baseline as well as some funky guitar riffs and upbeat drum patterns the track flows nicely throughout and the end result is quite good 34k moves nicely with some pretty solid drum beats and a nice subtle electro tingled baseline that combine quite well mid way into the track with some twirling melodies another very solid production from the studio s of a very solid disc here from luke that is stronger for me then the first
earlier this year debuted on 1080p with a notable ep the canadian producer real name laura sparrow took the alien sounds of detroit electro and injected them with melody and human emotion that records follow-up arrives on another promising label: the project led by dj fett burger and jayda g (who released a split mix cassette with sparrow in august) s releases are anchored to the dance floor but sparrows record points to outer space the title refers to an annual astronomical event and the tracks take their names from celestial bodies even if youre not well-versed in polynesian terms for star clusters they still suit the music perfectly is a send-off into dark but dreamy electro with clear tones and spacious atmospheres rlyeh is the only aggressive track likely due to a turnaround by e-gzr (who has worked with another fett burger outlet wania) the vibe is similar on a smoldering electro stepper and are both filled with light but where the first is strange and sci-fi the second is blissfully soothing (its also the only 4/4 track here) on an edit from sparrows previous ep she adds just a fraction more detail to the void hits the coldest note the first 12 bars suggest a vile electro cut before its all enveloped in a gorgeous haze of blue the sadness is universal but constructed in a way that underlies sparrows special style
jack adams has been steadily pushing uk club music to its limits proving just how creative you can be while still writing bangers this years club mix of its peak where chords hobbled and skipped across an obstacle course of percussion was a good start to a demolition job that finishes his newest ep (and possibly the weirdest thing ever released on rinse) completely removes any stable ground and lets adams float through the same space that made frequent collaborator logos cold mission so mesmerizing at least has to ground it and the young mc sounds completely at home twisting around the space-age grime stabs and hi-hats adams instrumental sounds improvised as if it were following s lead around each sharp corner a testament to his ear for building oddly intuitive rhythms is a scrambled array of stop-motion sounds (mini spinbacks slamming doors lasers) with only a single hi-hat and jackhammer drums to pull the pieces into orbit it shouldnt work and yet when it starts hiccuping like a scratched cd in its last minute it has the galvanizing effect of a techno white noise blast spyro-assisted dont is its calmer cousin lurching on wobbly stilts before drifting away through an ornate breakdown that feels like it was brought in from another tune entirely its all held together by a hairline thread and that implied instability is fast becoming s trademark one that makes him one of the most consistently inventive uk producers going
2008 saw an awful lot looking back in world dance music with many art ts fering rev itations and re-presentations various classic sounds such as d co dub techno and deep house japanese label mule proved itself to be prescient indeed in predicting third se trends when it released again halfway through 2006 an outstanding collection lush deep house tracks originally produced and released terre thaemlitz in 1990s and early 2000s now fiercely experimental and intellectual producer returns to sound with h first full-length album under moniker however most definitely not thaemlitz cashing in he deeply suspicious deep house revival and in many ways an attempt to make us question what we think deep house means and to draw our attention to contexts that formed sound n a moment delicious irony thaemlitz lays it out on album opener ntro with a coolly delivered voice-over that deliberately evokes scores classic house monologues re must be a hundred records with voice-overs asking house answer always some greeting card bullshit about life love happiness not universal hyper-specific contexts which deep house sound emerged are forgotten: sexual and gender cr es transgendered sex work black market hormones drug and alcohol addiction loneliness rac m h v act-up mpkins square park police brutality queer-bashing underpayment unemployment and censorship all at beats per minute but album nt just an intellectual exerc e n course locating sound in a highly specific context thaemlitz treats us to well over an hour exqu ite deep house o r than a handful monologues and loops vocal samples thaemlitz eschews vocals and keeps things instrumental re are no wailing divas here but instead richly textured productions that are warm and enveloping full gently tapped pianos and flute notes floating even as tracks groove (and y do indeed groove many se tracks would be quite welcome on a dance floor) res a gentle fluid grace to res a definite twinge melancholy here too for thaemlitz deep house not music celebration but music sadness perhaps th sadness for original context that has been erased buried and gentrified perhaps its sadness original context itself perhaps its a mix both melancholy clearest on pt hrs almost nine minutes gently drifting ambience as a piano s tly dances over warm gentle tones sound a record crackling and popping and a womans voice reflecting on seeing somebody getting knocked around final minute silent except for sound vinyl crackling more than anywhere else on album th track underlines what deep house means to thaemlitz sadness pain threat sudden violence and fleeting prom e escape in a club an incredibly deep album not just in terms deepness house on fer but emotionally and intellectually so as thaemlitz maps out sound in a deeply personal way a meditation on meaning house a critique recent deep house revival an exploration one mans personal relationship with sound all se things not to mention being some best deep house youll hear in a very long time
thanks to their whimsical dj sets the have become ambassadors for vancouvers house scene despite only releasing a handful of records (plus the life in the zone tape that most of them were sourced from) they havent released anything in the last two years so their self-titled ep hits like a storm after a drought showcasing everything liam butler and jack jutson have to offer with five reassuring slow jams (almost a clich d title for a track at this point) has all the goodies weve come to expect from theres a boogie bassline pitter-patter drums and a sunny guitar that recalls the swampy disco mantras album a fan favourite thats been floating around for a while has a carefree whistling lead and a rhythm section that sounds like its out for an afternoon stroll two of the tracks and hint at the duos origins in the vancouver indie rock band gold the formers brash lashes of post-punk guitar and gremlin vocal sample are especially silly albeit funky that leaves a tasty morsel that explores the dub influence that runs through the steppers sound in a new way drums echo and wah-wah melodies sneak in and out while chords hang thick in the air a transition from house to skank that feels as comfortable as everything else jutson and butler do
joe ndrews and tom halsteads project feels like an opportunity to let off steam after their second raime album tooth introduced through the boomkat editions sub-label bk12x12 in late 2016 is a more brutal use of ndrews and halsteads encyclopaedic knowledge of garage grime and jungle than the subtler raime oscar powell who runs diagonal with jaime williams has said drum bass was his first real musical love so its little surprise s latest record lands on the label the lead track is allegedly based around samples from a discarded rework of source direct recycled into a full-blown production is chilling and stripped-back finds ndrews and halstead leaning on early grime for inspiration throwing their weight behind monumental sub-bass frequencies over these a tense interplay between sparse rhythms b-movie synth lines and vocal samples unravels is exquisitely produced right down to the way oddball samples land perfectly in its milliseconds of silence
safety net s ep for hippos n tanks was a bizarre hybrid of rave techno and pop where silky diva vocals collided with frenetic breakbeats and sugary childlike voices peppered james ferraro-esque synth tracks though some of its beats were identifiably techno the whole ep was such a hodgepodge that they got lost in its odd soup on his debut for fifth wall however makes his techno leanings all too explicit he pitches down his own vocals for the rigid title track using them as rhythmic accents al g with jangling percussi and synths that crunch and gurgle pleasantly more robotic vocals and swishy synths lend a characteristically oddball touch to the machine funk of on but whose three incarnati s take up two thirds of the eps runtime is excruciating reels off techno notables in a bored and heavily processed voice: who killed robert hood who killed seth troxler who killed juan atkins and so maybe the intenti is to show up the inherently reacti ary nature of the scene or perhaps its a clumsily executed homage either way not even a particularly garish synth can alleviate the tedium the plodding lines are pitched down (for all his wackiness s palette is narrow) and lavishly reverbed the alternate versi though the snappy snares and deep kicks j s remix are welcome they do little to lessen the vocals grating quality
having cut their teeth with releases on futureboogie and hot natured waif strays mos nelson and rich eanland seemed destined to join the fun going on at madtech such is the ristol duos rascally no-nonsense brand of house music dont is the pick with grunting bass keys underpinning a flurry of handclaps before its headline asset a rubbery pitch-bent groove steals the show if its aiming for big rooms which surely it is then it hits the bullseye the foot comes off the gas just a tad on with whip-cracking 909 snares coupling with pinging 808 cowbells nelson and eanland later push the track towards a sort of house/breaks hybrid there is little in the way of pretension here; waif strays aim is to keep it simple snag you with big hooks and to trust in the power of their drums
hacienda resident close cohort of new order and collaborator on a number of early 90s releases on labels like soma and eastern bloc waited a hell of a long while to release a record under his own name not surprisingly makes up for lost time sounding a lot like what must have been in the mans record bag some 20-odd years ago d be hard-pressed to go more old school than the main mix of with vocalist donald waigh doing his best jamie principle and dasilvas roland gear chugging along just as it always does its great but why bother rush hour has made a point of reissuing just this sort of thing so its not like the music box-approved originals are out of reach and theres honestly no updating or reimagining going on here the dub mix sounds a bit fresher with sparkling bursts of piano and ghostly wisps of the original vocal but i cant help but wonder why dasilva didnt take his decades of knowledge and push things forward a little brailles remix however finds a lovely balance between old and new by re-stitching the lightweight original into something equally dense and party-guaranteed both with sepalcure and solo praveen sharma has shown a knack for transforming vocal lines and giving them a pillowy midrange to rest on and his take on is a showcase for what this producer does best

through breakout eps for anunnaki cartel and mannequin has proven she can stir up a dance floor on her debut album the club takes a back seat to the artists creative vision and avant-garde sound design silvia jim nez alvarez has no formal musical training per se shes only been djing for the last two years and has performed a handful of live shows in that time shes a fresh and daring new talent whose interests span styles eras and continents lp is roughly split between soundscapes and more danceable tracks but those that nod to the floor stantaneous formation and arent clubby in a conventional sense beats play second fiddle to melodies and atmospheres and both built from granular bass-heavy foundations are the weightiest of these tracks s other half is even better begins with distant tribal rumblings then adopts a more threatening industrial tone change is seamless as is the mingling of hi-hats and field recordings of scraping metals another striking transition occurs on muted pistons pump persistently at the start; the sound of a persian santur wafts alluringly about the cogs and gears machines then give way to hand drum rhythms before out of nowhere a middle eastern bass skank ensues is a tribute to alvarezs parents and their love of jazz o is droning and formidable at first but achingly melancholic pads appear later yll leave you feeling wretched by the end now has a residency via mannequin at berghains s ule and a collection of inventive releases shes come a long way in a few short years not in an explosive trendy sense but quietly and genuinely if is the shape things to come there is much to look forward to

samuel ndr madsen may have parted ways with his drum kit in 2006 to make way for 1210s and a mixer but his knack for percussion never left him the danish producer is at his best when hes crafting rhythms and they make his tracks a good deal more evocative than they might seem on paper fter debuting on tartelet last year with some pretty standard sample-house hes gone a little techy for the ep his nsyde debut its not a perfect record but madsen plays to his strengths kicks off with a spacious silent state -esque stomp punctuated by a cowbell line imbued with the sort of detail youd imagine only a trained percussionist could bring madsens beat constantly morphs and modulates but his melody just three descending chords feels comparatively static and underdeveloped s melody isnt vastly more complex but it employs a devastating trick: madsen milks one chord for nearly the whole track so when he finally lifts up the pedal and releases the remainder of the chord progression your hands fly upward almost reflexively on their remix cid test alums chterbahn d mour unleash rhythms more knotted up than madsens but their drum sounds arent nearly as engaging luckily they bring a gooey acid in around the halfway mark thatll have you in the palm of their hand regardless
its taken fina records a relatively short period of time to reach its tenth release almost exactly two years since mic newmans inaugural ep the leeds label has adopted an adept a r operation cleverly acknowledging while never p ering to recent house music trends taking the imprint into double figures with a hefty six-track ep is local producer ethereal opener escorts you across swathes of lush electronics holding off the drop until well into the fifth minute it provides the release with a strong seductive start on remix duty jack keeps things simple maintaining the originals emotive veneer but with a touch more dance floor swing on dont taylor significantly lowers the pace intensifies the atmosphere making for an impassioned uplifting roller normal service is resumed on piano house burner as taylor marries classic zesty chords with the dulcet tones of luther v ross to give the desired climactic effect the dub strips away both piano vox to leave a surprisingly engaging groovier affair while long time associates clive da team up to offer the highlight of the release this time replacing the piano with a chassis that oozes nothing but classy conceit
its ridiculous in a way: i could open a window heave a rock and probably hit cords hq or plunk dr dunks himself (well maybe not but the label and its artists do reside in nyc) nd yet its fucking impossible to find any of their releases in the city or in the outlying borough shops instead the moment weww releases come off the press theyre immediately shipped overseas beckoning from phonica with that pricey overseas (not to mention pounds sterling conversion) shipping rate s the primary outlet for documenting whatever it is that rubntug duo thomas ullock and eric duncan are up to (not to mention being the original home of quiet villages mischievous disco edits) its oft-times worth paying the exorbitant amount lest i watch map of frica obby marie otterman empire or what have you get listed on discogs in the 79 99- 109 99 range scant weeks on dr dunks is yet another name for the work of eric duncan and while i cant parse if it really is to be played at 33 1/3 (per the label) i do know that it makes for a lackluster affair spun at 45 instead it fares slightly better starts with an echoing snare and fidgety keyboard line like something from a john carpenter or john hughes film before the jungle rain preset gets deployed duncan keeps some misty ominous chords wafting in the background and once some chinatown motifs get out of the way a knife-wielding guitar solo comes through only to revert back to 80s soundtrack fills rides a pitter-pat bit of percussion that reminds me of syreetas underappreciated tiki tiki donga (from her 1977 album one to one ) before expanding outwards its laidback pm-wise hewing closer to the alearic portion of the crate filled with more weightless synth washes and ever-present tiki-tiki touches with a gorgeous outburst of piano in the middle maybe not worth the 10 for shipping but you may have to pay that much more just to find it online now anyway nd dont even get me started with how they underpress these things

noise artist dominick fernow and order community alum make an odd couple the formers music is seriously malevolent hes a vision of pent-up fury when on stage howling down the mic over distortion and squealing machines ut the music can also be quite lovely in a macabre and deeply harrowing sort of way whether with purients twisted noise or the techno he makes as vatican shadow fernow invites us to dine at the table of extremes every time s incandescent rainbow-dappled techno sits at the other end of the spectrum and yet his collaboration with works sparkles with just a hint of melancholia and fernows presence seems small but integral he opens the piece with bleary incomprehensible spoken word sounding as if hes groaning from the bottom of a well slowly his voice is swallowed by fakes melody which includes a spangled guitar and saintly synth notes towards the end on the -side is nice pastel-coloured house music that gets progressively coarser its surprisingly a lot tougher on the ears than which is another part of this records appeal
i get quite excited everytime release a record and with the latest release by dan sampson jhereal they have yet again given me another good reason to get excited is the track and it comes with a storming danny howells edit it is the danny howells re-edit that features on the a-side and it is a pure summer house anthem a beautiful funky guitar riff starts the track with some nice atmosphere giving the track a smooth aura to begin vocal snippets build early on leading into the introduction of the smooth baseline that rolls nicely for the remainder of the track nice piano snippets work well with the full vocal line that comes in during some nicely crafted breakdowns resulting in a stunning re-edit by the howeller on the flip is firstly the intrumental mix which is a nice extended version showcasing the great sounds of this record such as the smooth baselines and funky riffs the radio edit follows and it is a short version focusing on the vocals of the track although the danny howells edit is essentially just that an edit it really does show how well danny has put the instrumental and the vocal delights together creating the full package something the original mixes on the b-side fail to do
this is the last time ill mention post-dubstep or future bass in this review you have my word its not that these tags are irrelevant to considering the producer born ryan merrys last set of original productions 2009s bouncy bassy predator mode ep exemplified what we pesky music critics are getting at with them they just have nothing to do with ts latest natures if san franciscos party (which t co-runs) has made its name bridging the gap between the wobblier dance music of the last half-decade and the more standard house that informs it then this inaugural release for their label arm represents a critical link in that bridge the ep is less striking for its bass weight than its profound effervescence the title cuts energy pushes hard at its seams with a galloping beat and face-first metallic chords upping the pressure with each reiteration of the hook theres considerably less melody on you could imagine it slotting into an scb set or maybe even ben klocks bag natures s remixers caught the bug as well even if its symptoms are presented quite differently lando s inspired rework cools things down though his peculiar melodic flip disorienting reverb and murky low-end are plenty unhinged in their own right jus-eds mix funkily mechanical as ever but with an epicness not often found on underground quality seems less about what he does to the track than what it does to him
it only takes a short scroll through s patchwork blog to realise he prefers house music as it used to be made his label has further illustrated the point putting out a handful of releases that heavily reference chicagos golden era its latest record goes one better enlisting the vocal services of one of the windy citys most respected figures title track is an uncomplicated slice of classic house all the hallmarks are there: warm pads bouncing bassline and invigorating lyrics courtesy of while its a formula thats very well established sols production values are tight enough to pull it off his own mix throws in some stabs and a rampant kick and clap combo to give the original a dose of peak-time propulsion before darts off towards shadier climes jackhammer snares and a wily synth line make it the eps standout same frantic percussion remains on providing the framework for the tracks fat feisty bassline it helps round off an effective release from albeit one whose personality is perhaps a little too trapped in a bygone era
ill admit from the start that im not firmly into the french ed anger/maximal type sound ut i was intrigued to hear what was up to after being bombarded by kernkraft 400 during my formative years (the commercial version was actually a remix by dj gius) and after hearing my views havent changed particularly but its given me more respect for the style you see florian senfter knows exactly what hes up to a massive bashy riff made from some demented gorilla smashing around on a set of toms further crackling rhythms a structure that suddenly fires nitrous on all cylinders and stutters the main riff nicely big fun in a vocal skit ( oh yeah the beat is going on ; you get the idea) its remarkable how much party he can stuff into a track without making it sound flat with overkill meanwhile has a squelchy screaming hook and wacky farting noises its telling that he had a facebook campaign where people sent in whatever samples they wanted for him to make a track out of never a straight face dj and art chop things up; here one section then another adds a piano sound that follows the original and big stop-start breaks into different passages with crashing cymbals not miles away from the original but changed with regards to flow art experiments with said flow even more and its hard to tell whether hes trying to make it more interesting or aiming for full-throttle club decimation and falling somewhat short the game oy sounds that come in half way make it clearer: hes adding playfulness to the original as if it needed it
laolus remix of dele sosimis is dixon and mes favourite track of the year that sentence says a lot about this 12-inch it was crowned an anthem before it even hit wax few seconds into laolus rework of and its easy to see why it appeals to the crew: the bassline is the kind of simple endearing melody that says a thousand words basically tailored for a dixon set the string-laden breakdown would be compelling even on laptop speakers never mind a huge system and elements from dele sosimis original a clipped guitar phrase here some funky drumming there are elegantly slotted into the groove its so manicured and unapologetically epic that its a surprise it didnt come from one of the label heads themselves (some originally speculated that it was me) that remix alone would justify a single-sided 12-inch but irfan rainy and rex leon (of manchester label rainy ) throw in a level-headed version that tones down some of the theatricality of laolus effort their remix takes some of the snappy horn lines and guitar from the original and throws it all into a slow cooker me and dixon are two of the worlds most popular djs and whatever you might think of them its hard to question their enduring popularity when they keep sussing out bombs like this

barcelonas lapsus records has shown signs of great ambition in its early stages by releasing a handful of objets dart that also play excellent music their latest comes with a well-designed heavy card sleeve clear vinyl and a generous eight tracks (all for the price of a single) by former drum bass producer pedro here however his sound is a vigorous blend of idm experimentalism blunted with a dance floor electro sheen that sounds something like a more synth-orientated byetone opener does what its name suggests and grabs the attention from the outset with its heavy kick drum and supple melodies running forcefully over a backdrop of grainy samples and menacing drones follows a similar trajectory before slows things down a notch finally closes the side with its ricocheting guitar-like riffs which combine nicely with more overt dub elements the flipside kicks off with the sound of dancers trapped in a force field on while adds a touch of vocals to its broken beat stagger is one of the standout tracks with its robotic almost gothic core managing to be both driving and pleasantly overbearing the fittingly named and equally excellent closes the set almost in techno country with enough dark ambience to scare even sandwell district while there is something special to every track the only real criticism is perhaps a lack of diversity to the sound but its nonetheless a feisty release from an intriguing new label
with recent releases from producers like dasha rush and orphx you probably associate dam xs label with throbbing darkroom techno youre not wrong but its first release of sounds a whole lot cheerier than usual its the debut s release from -man (in collaboration with erman rob strobe) and unconventional as it may be hes not a bad fit: the grooves here are a little looser and certainly housier than usual but they pack just as much as power as anything else on the imprint starts out innocently with particulate matter converging into shapes as bits of metal attach themselves to the frame and sequentially endow it with some bassy oomph when the snares come in they have a mischievous skip like they were stolen off some old forgotten house record its disorienting at first yet it imbues this slice of dark techno with a light-hearted sense of momentum the dissolution of house into techno is a real theme here: throws what sounds like buoyant hand percussion underneath a charging steam engine until it gets lost in the monochrome blur of teutonic revelry while deadens melody into a half-awake pulse dotted by dread chords and a skittering slippery snare/hat pattern
the image of the shaman is intrinsic to dance music and we dont just mean mr c and co pretending to be dickensian drug dealers on ebeneezer goode but while you dont need a phd in anthropology to identify the links between ancient tribal dances and the communal celebration of the modern club you do need a certain sense of credulity when listening to people blathering on about being taken to a higher spiritual plane during a tiesto set a phd in advanced techno would probably be an advantage when listening to however for whether as half of modern heads with gianluca meloni or the solo artist behind such tracks as 2008s no more the italian producers dark and austere techno is as determinedly highbrow as it is defiantly hard work his decision to base 2010s daughter of phorsys ep around the greek gods showed a man clearly unafraid of accusations of pretentiousness his debut album is similarly conceptual exploring both the idea of the shaman and his own interpretation of african rhythms africa is hardly uncharted territory for western dance music the continents traditional polyrhythmic percussion having been purloined by everyone from leftfield to dj gregory and the entire afro house movement but sabatinis approach is much different to simply chucking djembe samples over some loops indeed apart from the syncopated drum patterns its initially hard to discern any ethnic influences at all shamans path seems more alien than african: and ritua might sound like they contain samples of croaking frogs and tribal cries across the savannah but filtered through sabatinis circuitry they could just as easily be bursts of static and the whimpers of dying satellites heard across space while sabatinis stripped-back aesthetic and heavy processing means he avoids most of the tie-dyed clich s of ethnic music if youre not paying attention the mechanical scrapes and rattling beats of a track like can just seem like stereotypical minimal techno you wont need to put yourself through quite the same mental and physical rigours that true shamans do to achieve enlightenment here although you will need to put a certain effort into readying your mind for shamans path to reveal its full rewards if youre prepared to fully immerse yourself in it sabatinis exquisite production of otherworldly sounds seem to lead to heightened perceptions; previously peripheral noises like the low drones of coalesce into almost synaesthetic visions but be warned: the foreboding atmosphere throughout means that if shamans path is a vision of africa its much more joseph conrad than joe claussell an existential journey to the heart of darkness
though shes referred to herself as the first lady of beatdown kua marcelle grants work as is defined by vocals her voice evokes a sense of longing; distant wails seem to convey intimate feelings grant first came onto the house scene 20 years ago as a vocalist s a house music artist with an extensive discography its now clear she had more to say her first records were molten detroit-style thumpers which after a long period of rejection were championed by mike huckaby deep house disco edits and a techno alias called femanyst followed her catalogue is dotted with music that is in turns raw sassy and melancholy grants latest album burrows into a deep house sound with muffled kicks and decaying vocals cocooned into the mix thats no surprise considering the album arrives on skylax a prolific label whose catalogue includes reissues of k-s h e s routes not roots a series of eps and also an album on comatonse similar sense of isolation resonates on its drowsy pulse reminiscent of early 90s new rk house but doesnt paint a narrative like k-s h e k terre thaemlitz nstead it presents a variety of subtle afterhours tracks built around demure chords and heavily swung drums though is comprised of various styles of house its lulled tempos over time can seem uniform ts the vocals that make the album memorable delivered in floating desperate phrases the sung melodies become the heart of each track hurtin tops off its seasick chords with bellows of heartache dont t (f rl t ) the skeleton of a deep house track is flush with gorgeous lo-fi moans ts been said that words become unnecessary once meaning is understood that rings true on the albums strength comes in the message the tracks and grants voice especially suggest: if you are hurt can be a place to find solace
to be honest the press release for this 12-inch is so epic that the best thing to do would be just to quote it in full with full record geeks enthusiasm it details the cratediggers journey that befell mike simonetti and johnny jewel and lead them to no less than four versions of s a result simonetti and jewel take the artists slot on this one not only for their extended edit of the original track but for their digging chops in unearthing a little dusty dollar-disco diamond it seems like theres weird cover versions of this all over the world one surfaced in ustralia nother at a north portland rummage sale nother sung in was found by jewel in san diego outside of a record store in an alley behind a pharmacy which is how you know these guys are hardcore: they are literally looking for records in the alley outside the record store the original a lynchpin of the duos lauded lbuterol mix is an immensely catchy trash-disco delight with over-the-top everything: urgent horns handclaps scratchy guitar rousing melody and an unbeatable soap opera storyline that revels in the clich s of stardom dreams born and broken in california with its brutal near-ridiculous melodrama i could imagine rainer fassbinder spinning it the cover versions are a cabinet of wonders or hotel mini-bar of wonders unto themselves the version plucks the riff from claptons layla replaces the horns with bright-ass synths and retells the tale in dietrich deadpan suddenly conjuring not only smoky berlin cabaret but traditional schlager-schmaltz the and versions are close kin both slowing the tempo and upping the pathos with that world-weary feeling you only get in overwrought 70s rock
john talabot opened his recent dj-kicks mix with s spooky synth jam journey to the centre of the sun that record with its gloopy bells pinned to a beat that verged on narcolepsy set a pitch-perfect opening for talabots off-kilter house trip you can see why phonica were inspired to sign s follow-up but though treads similar ground the atmosphere that made journey so mesmerising has all but evaporated where previously s records have felt crammed under intense pressure into a tiny space is music in widescreen ll three tracks are live analogue jams with jazzy licks that whirl away like wisps of cloud but for all the prettiness of the individual elements theres a sense that sound design is more important than structure and are impressive displays of synthesis but too clinical and aimless to hold your attention starts more promisingly but it too soon introduces the kind of aimless scales a restaurant pianist plays to be ignored its a shame because clearly each part is lovingly crafted they just lack an overriding structure to pin individual moments of prettiness together
you have to admire lazare hoches initiative a few years ago the now 24-year-old student moved to paris built a home studio started his own label ( ) and began releasing music by himself and his friends i havent heard all of their records but i imagine i dont sync so vol 1 which hoche recorded with the dutch artist malin genie was something of a breakthrough catchy funky and elegantly produced its a never-leave-your-bag party record but even as the vinyl sold out the release met with little fanfare when it dropped in 2012 (aside from the inflated discogs prices) now remastered and repressed it ought to make a bit more of splash i dont sync so vol 1 is the kind of house ep that gives you everything you need: big kicks big basslines funky drum patterns vocals even lyrics in the case of s not subtle music but its executed with class and an impressive pop sensibility is the alpha dog here with its garage-y breaks smooth-as-almond-butter keys and cooing invitation to a one-night stand courtesy of mar is similar but dialed in a bit with a simple descending melody and more understated vocals oh has a more lazy humid vibe helped along by a winding synth melody who hits the hardest with a stop-start garage beat and a bassline so chunky it works as percussion but for me the pick of the litter is a soothing blue-note house track that feels perfect even before the subaquatic organ rolls in near the end over time each one takes turns being your favorite
previous eps for z udio siblings on the edge and smokin sessions align with synkro indigo and dfrnt as one of dubsteps more cinematic producers followers of the yardcore sub fm sessions however will be aware that his tastes splay right across the spectrum a scope proved most potent with his latest release on hip-hop dubstep and techno freewheel through spacious dubby vistas not as a frankenstein of their parts but as a sound in perpetual mutation displays his dexterity via the eps three-part title track which crafts the same palette of samples strings and gentle timbers into very different sonic terrains pt undulates along a steady 4/4 heartbeat that becomes slowly choked with chimes pt is flexed over fluctuating tempos before lapsing into an aching reprise yet its the floor-tapered that is the standout here transforming all of subtleties and dub techno cool into a warm and dusty swinger
s detroit continues its epic 50 year struggle while the auto industry bleeds out its heartening to see michigan get some love on the cover of matthew dears latest dispatch illustrated by dashes with a clever play on the logo to identify the motor city is a timely reminder of the states role as the perennial proving ground for new merican techno products these tracks arent fueled by the jittery end-of-days paranoia that kept 2007 speeding along like some titanium concept car rushing towards a nuclear sunset the scene in is much more organic as the title track lopes into your speakers and sets up shop with a few squeaky hinges and clanking gears its a rusty machine powered by a complicated engine of vocal samples that play the role of bassline hook and chorus throwing off disorienting helium moans and rib cage-rattling groans that scrape the bottom of the bass bin is nimble with an almost claustrophobic web of pops and clicks running down the center straightforward vocal loop echoes the track title and as the sounds pile up over the course of seven minutes i wait for everything to settle down into some kind of groove it doesnt happen instead remains an intriguing mess that earns its title is comparatively stripped down with a skeletal frame some broken-muffler high-hats and a slinky keyboard lick that keeps things moving its a satisfyingly heavy track with thudding drums and a hard bass floor but its all prelude that never quite gets off the ground lthough and are respectable songs that wont break dears winning streak the title track is one of his finest moments since mouth to mouth and justifies the entire purchase if only michigan could trade its music on the dow jones
s slow house mission continues with a track that clocks in at a smooth 115 pm be e dropping even lower an extended breakdown at no shit 75 pm in a recent interview with r matt tolfrey attested to its power and difficulty likening its bass to the low-end of a dubstep track and wondering whether it would even be possible to play it mid-set to a crowd without losing them its a valid concern but is too catchy to resist a song that just happens to be played at a danceable tempo most of its length at least meanwhile showcases jaars latin side mixing horns what sounds like guitar and plenty of percussion along with a breathless singer its digital latin house and it sounds a little hackneyed as a result an uneasy merging of analog and digital elements that are un tunately given shape by a kick drum bit like the kid at church who wears a tie an hour each week and tears it off the moment he gets outside the doors you get the sense that is just aching the sort of breakdown that makes so special
x y r stands for xram yedinennogo razmuwlenuja a name taken from nikolai gogols 19th-century novel dead souls it roughly translates as temple solitary thought which is a fitting name for vladimir karpovs ambient project the russian artists music whether it feels uplifting calming or unsettling usually seems lonely it might have something to do with his choice of equipment which includes old soviet-era synthesizers the solitary nature of karpovs music comes to bleak and depressing life on his latest album sounds as though its been made with hardware on its last legs synth leads are often foggy or overdriven from the moment you put on it sounds worn crackles surface on the beautiful which calls back to 70s synth records from the likes of tangerine dream or popol vuh karpovs music has mirage-like qualities his synth melodies warble like bent guitar notes while the melodies hang in the muggy air on the creeping basslines and melting synth lines of one of the albums highlights gentle repetition distorts like a heat-hazed landscape one of s unusual touches comes from the vocalist tosya chaikina who sighs and sings wordlessly over two tracks her fleeting vocals add mystery and sadness to karpovs music theyre gone as suddenly as they came leaving only desiccated synth sounds that feel even more desolate than before karpov likes to draw things out even his rhythmic tracks seem still take the 11-minute closer despite its discrete drum beat the percussion serves only to make it feel even more zoned-out as it builds in its weary way towards a sort-of climax many of karpovs past releases including his last tape for not not fun are typical of most new age music: peaceful relaxing and a little mysterious on theres something sinister lurking underneath the album seems meditative but it finds sorrow instead of calm in repetition the equivalent of fixating on a single negative thought rather than clearing your mind while electronic music continues to explore music that instils feelings of calm spirituality and self-improvement shows the beauty of solitary sadness
socal earic thats how philip sherburne described the second release from last year ive struggled to find any better descriptor los angeles crew arent redefining disco but there is something unusually breezy and very california about what they do (even if some of them arent actually from california) y wear the spirit of classic house flamboyance without just ripping it off and they fashion the retro futurist shimmer of disco edits into something meatier than just loops ir first full length house slippers expands the labels roster while maintaining their style of bottom bump kick drums and fluffy cloud synthesizers sasha s opening remix is in a nutshell s excessive and sprawling the intro alone is three minutes long but every pristine sparkle feels totally worth it pseudo michael mcdonald vocal is so overwrought youd think it has to be a joke but i dont think it is which makes it even better verything on house slippers pulses with that same disco heartbeat but shined up with an iridescent oil coat a tapestry of funk guitar samples on s is kneaded into liquid ven the skeletal mr verything by is quickly beset by silky pads to soften its jagged dancepunk angles of all the participants probably has the most star power but he turns in the compilations strangest moment is a burned out husk of broken guitars and harsh stutters n its all muddled by a concrete grinder bassline that threatens complete eclipse but it also proves that this crew isnt just about summery grooves they can do anxious as on permanent s stunning remix of and they can do regal as with s elegiac curtain call yre not all perfect s is a little too murky but most labels just three releases in would kill for a compilation this strong
even for the genre of cosmic with its inherent tendency for hubris lindstr ms ambition is dizzying three tracks on clock in at 28:58 10:11 and 15:58 this is to supposedly allow him to develop different themes and let them evolve but despite appearances the reigning king of the scandinavian disco mafia doesnt actually stray too far from his comfort zone of melody-based music and as it turns out thats a good thing because when he drifts away into a beatless ether he gets lost in space that happens on the title track the longest of the trio lindstr m admits the length may be a problem for some people but if the tracks up to it it shouldnt just look at ldies timeless but where the jungle masterpiece holds your attention throughout its 20-minute length drifts into progressive and ambient meaninglessness not even a synth line from cerrones supernature can stop it from disappearing up its own black hole ts still a cosmic journey but one that should have stopped after one galaxy re left peering out of the window of your beleaguered spaceship as the stars whizz by each one becoming more and more indistinguishable from the last disappointment of is brought into especially sharp focus because the two other tracks are significantly better and more dynamic can see what lindstr m was trying to do with the track by listening to which is reined in and given far more purpose and direction thanks to clearly defined sections opens with a kind of frantic miami vice -esque glockenspiel mixed into a balearic guitar that would do studio proud a restrained breakdown gives way to what resembles a tv movie soundtrack from the 80s all of it comes together at the end where it becomes with judicious use of a bing noise emotive instead of schmaltzy the soundtrack to a perfect holiday on a white island is more cheesy than weve seen lindstr m before but retains a cute nostalgia without tipping into naff on deas lindstr m goes exploring again this time looking inward to his previous material from the kind of mid-tempo groove weve seen from him many times before the track morphs into something far more intense and hair/arm-raising over a base of neon sprinkles more and more layers are added along with the kind of melody beloved of alden tyrrell which goes up and up and up until it reaches the heavens ts like lindstr m has taken the same principle behind feel space and maximized it making it a devastating dancefloor bomb cosmic sound is by nature a bit daft but the more epic it gets the more it runs the risk of taking itself a bit too seriously and becoming smug the track falls into this trap and hampers an otherwise excellent album ts particularly frustrating because shows that lindstr m can experiment beyond his fondness for melody and succeed perhaps rather than aiming for the outer limits lindstr m should seek out a place somewhere between there and his home planet m sure it will be beautiful
serge santiago and firas waezs purist house instincts are at the fore of this first release on lph white lets play s new sub-label opener feelin revolves around a brassy icep-ish vocal that duels with increasingly forceful synth stabs and high weaving pads ts classic waze odyssey: a rock-solid basement house cut with no surprises the second track is intriguingly enough a remix of a song ( cos ) that has never been released london-by-way-of-california newcomer urulus remix could however just as easily be the original ts a waze odyssey-style blend of echoing vocal samples atmospheric pads and an arcing synth riff meanwhile has a work-in-progress feel to it a lower-key slightly meditative mix of thrumming bass and vocal samples it doesnt hold your attention as well as the first two tracks do
i treat this record as a memory said on s latest release a three-track 12-inch centered on ben s remix of insanity from 2010 it revisits the days when techno and dubstep first began to mingle but more than that it memorializes london artist stephen gordon whose vocal turns as the spaceape left an indelible mark on the world of low-end-focused club music s first collaboration with spaceape was this anxious bass hybrid about of all things the difficulties of parenting so it speaks volumes to gordons skill as a lyricist and the strength of his delivery that insanity still feels more like existential poetry; even set against ben s hulking churn gordon resonates with each deep satisfying syllable balancing the reissued material is an unreleased tune called s abstract production gathers wispy pads and a cutting bass synth not unlike his track viper setting the choppy melodic pieces over field recordings and a dismantled drum pattern it shows an experimental side of the dutch producer that we rarely hear and works well to offset the weight of two such enduring tracks
joris voorn and edwin oosterwals built in washes of synth stabs never quite breaking out but holding suspended throughout its length its an approach that hasnt been changed on this remix ep but what ben and dvs1 have done to 2004 original is charred it into something much more intense and rabid s winner here but only by a bit his remix was apparently tested out before being pitched to and its aggressive and visceral built on a vibrating undercurrent of toms snares hiss and pummelling analogue its both devastating and sublime dvs1 goes along a less bleak but more unnerving line with his reinterpretations the focus is unsure in mix are we supposed to feel comfortable within trance of backing pulse or terrified by overdriven knell that inflates dissonantly over it in more vacant is it puppet master mesmerisation or anxiety
dbridge and radioactive man are their debut collaboration re comes via craig richards a label that has a history of hosting bass producers trying their hand at house (marcus intalex as trevino dominik martin) on the imprints latest however the title track is the only overtly house moment and the sure highlight heavy kick is matched with a classicist arpeggiating synth pairing mid-tempo funk with electro hypnotism the result being a welcome addition to whatever record bag it finds itself in with more straightforward percussion darnly goes subaquatic with a menacing low-end as its defining feature is all about snare and has the most broken beat on the release the emphasis here is on the drums which are crispy and highly swung nevertheless its the -side thats going to be getting the most spins
another month another emotional house ep from life death label is usually reliable but ukrainian duo s efforts fall flat with lacking the emotive pull mind against or the high drama ten walls overriding feeling on the ep is that riding out a mid-set lull ep is bookended by its standouts such as they are title track a combination glistening horns clitter-clatter drums humming bass and birdsong is hardly original but it rattles away pleasingly enough digital bonus track he and she is also mildly engaging its croaking bass and flitting melodies creating a sense progression thats largely absent from the rest the ep elsewhere both and do little more than oscillate prosaically for six minutes is simply a mundane spin on the title track when done well this style music establishes a welcoming groove and then dusts it with moments emotional intensity does the former but doesnt manage the latter
over the course of five years irish producer gary caruth has zeroed in on what he wants to accomplish with the music he makes as his first release gestures found mostly experimental uses for a wide array of samples and field recordings though it was generally beat-centric two subsequent eps honed those ideas for a pretty sound that split the difference between house ambient and brainfeeder-style beats it wouldnt be wrong to say that caruths debut album compiles the best aspects of the catalog thus far but theres something about it that goes beyond mere linear growth across the albums seven tracks (ten on the digital edition) it would seem that the now glasgow-based producer has turned a corner and found his niche this is deep subtly deconstructed house music with its feet in a classic tradition and its head lost in reverie as beholden to deep house as is caruths enduring love for hip-hop emerges here and there a head-nodding beat pairs with gentle jazz chords and a full-bodied bass synth in the second half of and the blend of ideas is entrancing to hear unfold over 11 minutes with its queasy vocal loops and stuttered skip of a kick drum is nicely reminiscent of early flying lotus but it also feels too straightforward on an otherwise relaxed exploratory album among the most club-friendly tracks is which has a lovely kind of disorienting blunted sway that recalls fred p likewise piles on the samples for a smoky and soulful groove that sounds barely held together and is all the more enticing for it a steady 4/4 rises about halfway through the piece; at first its little more than a quiet thud underpinning caruths swirl of vocals piano bass and hi-hats but it soon grows into a proper house pulse freedom and formlessness are key factors to this musics appeal so the moments when everything comes together feel special speaking to scotlands the national caruth went into detail about his love for field recordings and musics interaction with outside sounds the amalgamation of music with the natural environment is essential to [the listening] experience and thats something im trying to do with my music he explained you can sense that much throughout which is often so sparse and meditative that it seems incomplete without say the chatter of an audience or the din of a busy street like dj sprinkles midtown 120 blues these tracks want to foster specific feelings more than they want to tell a story and to merge those feelings with the unpredictability of life doesnt always translate well to attentive listening but when heard out in the world it flourishes
if you have a few records on your shelf chances are you looked forward to s hardware-centric techno is a specific and consistent product: smooth dub contours gentle inclines slippery grooves its never been avant-garde but few have done it to such an exacting standard i for one am a big fan on first listen s first record of the year is much the same as whats come before despite a recent reorganisation of who does what (elias landberg is now the sole producer though the project still tours as a duo ) and are immersive techno tracks that in theory should work well on both dance floors and in headphones nd yet they lack a couple elements that are crucial to s appeal firstly the neck-snapping swing typical of a great track like convolution mirage or man on wire is missing relies on a swelling hum and pitter-patter modulations to push it forward while asks too much of its spidery bassline and skiffing hi-hats which fail to give it the desired urgency they also both have an issue that might stem from landbergs change of approach each tracks central idea lacks the boldness and clarity that was more apparent on the concise elastic loops of say phantom and much of s work from 2011 and 2012 those faults make for a disappointing return

french duo n ze are back on get physical with the second remix -inch of tracks from songs on the rocks this time vakant fixture mathias kaden and my my member lee give their take on n zes hedonistic live-life-for-the-moment number to a track that while perfectly embodying the duos flamboyance and blatant pleasure-seeking seems mismatched with the more sober spirit of the remixers of choice kadens remix is pinned down by a short and loopy four-note bassline perhaps keeping in the / tradition of polka the german takes snippets of scat singing whistling and beat boxing and weaves them around brass samples and snare heavy percussion while the mouthacapellapolka remix is a two-minute dj tool in which the original vocals are layered on top of an orally produced backbeat both mixes sound like a slightly more upbeat take on vakants signature sound basically its everything that you would expect from a mathias kaden remix of n ze no more no less whereas kadens remix pulls the more organic parts from n zes master tapes lee focuses on the electronics the brits remix sets off short vocal refrains and loops them around in different ways stretching and echoing n zes dancing command the echoing synths give the track a big-room sound discarding the more intimate feel of the source material while remixing is all about putting your own spin on a track its hard to get excited about moving a unique song into such generic territories nestled on the b-side here is that original a track that gives you the impression that the duo had good times aplenty in their studio as they were making it there is a lighthearted spontaneity and improvisation in the cabaret-sounding track which combines whistling electric guitars wind instruments and thick french accents if kaden and had spent more time thinking about how this vibe was compatible with their own and less time on studio wizardry it stands to reason that the outcome would have felt more inspired
the pairing of kink (real name strahil velchev) and neville watson has rarely resulted in tracks that are mindblowing or transcendent on their own; they tend to turn that job over to the djs who love them though their starched and athletic take on house feels fresh its also unmistakably old-school to the extent that well-versed house fans might grumble that their records bear too much of a resemblance to their forebears ut the strong points of their productions which generally speaking aim directly at the butt make them pretty difficult to deny ll of this is once again at work on the duos latest for home base hour is your rush: in isnt exactly challenging music but youll find it difficult not to shake a leg to it give yourself to me the vocal mix implores as shimmering synths and a characteristically nimble drum machine add weight to the request sure you could stand off by the bar muttering something under your breath about this or that dance mania side kicking this tracks ass but youd be denying yourself a simple pleasure dub mix on the flip does a great job of injecting some deep space into the mix though not at the expense of kink watsons signature tidiness
is the occasional project of pe aka dj fett burger and s n pulling towards a minimalist ethos with orthodox approaches the duos music doesnt seem that impressive on paper classic drum machines are neatly tied to the grid and bits of melody are daubed on with a painterly touch but when it all comes together the sum is more striking than its individual parts s a-side is a pensive acid house march that stirs tension by going out of its way to do the opposite tight 303 phrases flash across a scale sometimes burrowing into bass frequencies and other times hitting a trio of mid-octave notes s composed rhythm makes it an excellent dj tool but its just as hypnotic on its own as when paired with another track i also uses a 303 foundation to entrancing effect but with only a couple of notes and a more exertive acid squiggle change it up on ii using a rougher drum kit and pumping it through a hissing atmosphere still all the gunk cant conceal how well-arranged it really is
the american west coast has been a fertile bed for several permutations of electronic music be it the thriving bay area dubstep scene or the always-expanding l a beat scene considering the expanse and in-house diversity of these collectives its surprising how little cross-pollination there is: you can usually pick out a member of a certain local scene quite easily without much margin of error until now that is paul head of the frite nite label and collective called sf home in recent years just recently relocating to la and it comes through in his sound: his tracks have a west coast exaggerated funkiness and playfulness to them along with the drunken swagger that only comes from years of digesting hip-hop each track on s debut is carefully considered and solidly written neither burning through too fast nor lingering past their welcome built meticulously from the ground-up the records main palette shares the overdriven and quashed sound of some of his contemporaries (think lazer sword only much much better ) however theres an intense and studied musicality on display particularly with the opening duo of and two tracks so silky they cant help but slip through your fingers and leave captivating melodies behind in the messy process the retro pastiches of his contemporaries sound boring and insincere in comparison also dips his fingers in dubstep and whatever else might be happening in the uk: you can hear bits of night slugs and other similarly house-oriented uk trends instead of flailing like a fish out of water the broader horizon endows s album with a level of sonic detail that you might not normally expect from a west coast producer the screeching hoover-pop of karatz is grounded with tremor-inducing sub-bass and 808 as if woooo riddim got caught it in its rapidly revolving spokes the cutesy vocal gymnastics on or the elliptical beats of cant help but bring to name any number of future garage producers and is the best joker track that joker never made absorbs more than just uk bass though the acid house gestures and skewed house beat of ill are prime examples of his myriad interests its this co-mingling of all these different styles that makes so exciting its energized with a pure love for music that lends it a rambunctious and endearing spirit i went into expecting yet another album of so-so west coast electro-funk and came out a zealous card-carrying resident of the nightmarish residency depicted on the cover
in the crowded bristol electronic music pool jacob martin has managed to find clear water away from his house collaborations with matthew lambert as outboxx and his recent hook-up with peverelist hes conjured this gripping collection as where he takes a more progressive (and were not talking digweed) approach without losing accessibility take the lead track where he captures the ground between experimentation and the dance floor in a similar manner to early warp releases raw analogue chimes ping back and forth undercut by a rotor blade rhythm warm swells of synths occasionally surface tethers a uk garage-style vocal snippet to broken techno drum patterns muffled bass and bursts of interference cools things down on where the tranquil pads industrial clanks and slo-mo pace of its first half bottom out into 8-bit squeals and groaning bass the tempo marginally lifts for the fuzzy house of meandering along to the rhythm of woodblock click-clacks and an arpeggiated melody if we didnt already know it is going places
the eponymous label of a parisian club focuses on high quality techno and house often from locals and other artists connected to the club 7am is the sixth installment of textures a series of compilation 12 inches and features four deep and diverse cuts from and tackles the early morning with aplomb stitching together rushy arpeggios and driving drums its polished and highly accessible but the sheen diminishes s likable quirks recalls mid 00s dimbiman with its prancing rhythms and slightly twisted mutterings gossamer pads and plaintive piano chords add some depth to the track resulting in a delightfully trippy after hours burner thats arguably the records strongest offering on applies his deft pop sensibility to coarse textures and tropical guitars which results in a joyous left of centre club bomb thats bound to appeal to a wide array of djs closes 7am with a solid slice of airy grooving tech house serene pads sit comfortably on top of s bumping bassline and its drum pattern takes cues from vintage kerri chandler
new yorks richard j valeo whose project sees him periodically delve into the weirder nether regions of artsy techno is clearly not a man to keep his cards to his chest; a quick glance at his bustling website a veritable treasure trove of overlapping words images and sounds is enough to make that clear happily the same energetic approach is in evidence on his latest release a digital-only double -side that contrary to prevailing trends makes artsy techno sound both sexy and eminently danceable comes in two distinct flavours: the first is a dark snaking ride into tech houses sleazy underbelly; the second a deep blissed-out dub roller that sounds like the kind of thing peter van hoesen would make on a valium-addled comedown kicking off with slowly building drones (the likes of which arch scaremonger xela would be proud of) the lackout version eases rather than bursts into action but by the time its 4/4 stomp registers its hard not to be gripped elastic synths foggy bass and pitch black atmospherics have made certain of that the dub incarnation meanwhile wastes no time in hitting 4th (or rather 3rd) gear and stays there for the extent of its seven minute duration as successive layers of percussion and panoramic washes of guitar build to create an atmosphere of dazed sun-drenched euphoria its hard to pick a winner and pretty pointless too: if you like your techno dreamy but propulsive both tracks are bang on
i just received my monthly shipment from hooj (www hooj com) and in it was a huge huge track from records lotus/4am is the name of this 2-song 12 from according to the baroque/ records website is the companys latest signing and this is supposedly their first release out of the two songs lotus was the standout track for me as it really does something new melodies churn in and out of the track and unpredictable twists turns will keep even the tightest trainspotters guessing it has a strange combination of dark and uplifting sounds that really works and im sure well all be hearing more from
triple r aka steps up to deliver the fifth instalment of his mix series which blends gems from s recent past with previously unheard delights from its near future whether or not you enjoy this cd will depend largely on whether you enjoy the sound in general: too skittish and insubstantial for some for others it represents minimal house and techno at its innovative energetic best as minimal s star has risen so too has that of and its producers some of the label s core artists like or oliver have emerged from relative obscurity to real prominence in the contemporary techno firmament: arguably their music has changed little in the last four or five years but global clubbers tastes have and as such these producers find themselves and their music in relatively high demand compilation kicks off with s own a pulsing moody scene setter before dropping into dominik s superlative re rub of s its original form was a rave monster; in s busy hands it takes on even more epic contorted proportions is all about enervated glitch and blip stretched and squeezed into tight insidiously funky shapes and offerings from eyer and pustel fit this blueprint perfectly when really you wish they would explode or reinvent it one of s biggest success stories gabriel offers up his remix of s a tightly coiled moody clicker that s been a big hit with djs in recent months it s one of the only tracks on this compilation taken from outside the immediate family and it shows: the warm trippy keys which brings to the fore form just the kind of hook which the other tracks frequently hint at but can t or won t quite deliver all too often the tracks which comprise this compilation sound aimless their minimalism masking a lack of depth or progression triple r s fast cutting approach to mixing (there are 0 tracks on here) is clearly intended to keep things interesting but it has precisely the opposite effect with each component track given very little room to breathe the bombardment of vaguely appealing percussive sounds becomes wearing even a little nihilistic tellingly the stand out tracks are the two bizarre takes on pop : dressing their slick rhythms with off kilter vocals s in the and noze s burrow into a consciousness basically unbothered by the rest of the album s cuts still it s important to note that a great number of the individual tracks cherry picked by ( s mobilee esque is terrific and the likes of swat squad audio and are all on fine form) will rock floors if well deployed s are after all an essential weapon in any minimal dj s arsenal as a dj though you wouldn t play one after the other after the other after the other and this compilation represents the reason why
nick h ppner didnt just compile his recent panorama bar 04 mix after a casual look through his record crate keen to create something special ostguts r manager commissioned new cuts from several producers sadly when the tracks came back not all of them could fit into the mix one of the upshots however is phillip lauer and gerd jansons first record of original material as its also the second on ostguts new sub-label fittingly the ep sounds like it was made with berghain and panorama bar in mind its house but with technos attitude s f s powers out of the blocks with a jagged brightly-hued synth arrangement only getting larger as time goes on the bassline used doesnt sound like acid but the way the duo manage to whip it away for savage barking asides is reminiscent of the 303s speedy versatility on the b-side has a more soulful patina by way of delayed rhythmic vocals but underneath its drums are just as tough and dry-sounding so too does its synth refrain tear at the periphery of the canvas rather than caress the final cut is both the records most funky and bruising simple filter house at heart it nonetheless manages to sound complex its thundering toms and sinister bass twirling in a sickening high speed dance like the other two it shows that personality need not be sacrificed in the name of simplicity or functionality

the first thing one notices with s ep is how little of it there is with both tracks under six minutes and the side barely exceeding four stott is certainly bucking the trend for long slowly evolving tracks not that either of these evolve quickly over their short time spans is stotts fifth release of no nonsense 4/4 for manchesters an offshoot of online retailer oomkat there is clearly an interest in early detroit and erlin techno at work here particularly in the sharp drums although unfortunately stott makes little of these influences sets up an immediate drum and bass arrangement loping at an unhurried tempo all very straightforward and functional shifting organic squelch flits from left to right as other grey dub shudders drift by then its all over shes works an offbeat pulse into stuttered gasps of morse code beside equally nervous and sibilant hats tapped out just like underground resistance nothing else hits as hard: theres a pleasing metallic ping a deep rolling whoomp and later some rumbling low-end gloom that could derive from a david lynch film but again its all rather cold and unengaging one must admire the brevity here but lament the lack of content

with only a handful of singles in his catalog remains a curious prospect four-plus years into his career his sound rooted in a smart use of vocal samples akin to four tets there is in you has evolved gradually from bubbly two-stepping house into something more leftfield and closer to ambient and though he moves further from the dance floor with each release that rhythmic essence along with his experimental arrangements and emotional overtones has stuck around one of his latest tracks is cold glitchy sampling paired with little more than a staccato chord loop and scribbles of restless sine waves it loosely resembles a stripped-down acerbic take on oneohtrix point nevers zebra its unlikely youll dance to it on its own but itd add some brilliant flair to anything with a beat if is the outr new single then is the crowdpleaser for fans of yugen with another choppy vocal sequence this time sounding like surf solar if fuck buttons forgot their distortion pedals the song glides through quietly uplifting melodies and motorik rhythms into a deconstructed finish it doesnt offer the anthemic wallop of sun or the romanticism of say last remnants but hits a mysterious sweet spot between those modes that breadth of expression flags as an artist who should undoubtedly be writing albums if that wasnt obvious already is an effective update from an inspired producer whose best work is still ahead of him
on his two previous eps northern english producer daniel martin aka has explored wonderfully ominous bass-heavy techno his first release on berlins adds extra texture and depth to the stark banging precedent set by those records the title track begins in familiar fashion with frenetic clattering drums and a rangy bass riff before topping things off with a highly caffeinated ragga-style vocal that gives even more edge to an already menacing concoction also has an echoing voice sample (this time a shimmering female one) which drapes itself over a relentless bass groove has bass drums as pounding as both of its counterparts but achieves a more contemplative end result thanks to a ghostly background of ethereal howls and light swishing keys it completes an invigorating trio from a rapidly developing talent who never forgets to include plenty of heart in his uncompromising warehouse jams
since its launch three years ago nijmegens has been steadily delivering warm spacey techno from mostly dutch talent among that cast is who made their debut with monocle a dubby smoked-out record for the label in late 2012 (their one other production credit is a laid-back effort on last years strong collection compilation on field records ) the trio has now been tapped for a second more floor-friendly release called the ep begins with the fast house-y cut driven by a thick acidic bassline and draped in starlit tones its pretty nifty on its own but the two b-side tracks are the real draw dialing down the bpm and each lock in a winding three-over-four synth line in the former its a subtle pattern that materializes lower down weaving around a modulated bassline and thickets of hi-hats and cymbals in its a euphoric acid-infused riff that takes the lead twisting above lightly shuddering drums and moody pads the result is an appropriately cozy close to another good release for and

after a rash of releases nearly one year ago has been relatively quiet that all changes though with the ep which proves that the man was simply locked away attempting to expand on the ideas so gloriously well received on his debut 12-inch jagz the smack where he merged dubstep with hip-hop with shades of gloop skwee wonk chip tune and a whole heap of other unnecessary genre tags might be the erratic unpredictably glitchy dance floor stalker on here quaking faces when its arpeggiated backbone comes reeling in from the left side of nowhere but rings out like tempered s southern hip-hop jam found on the flip to his joker collabo all deep 808 kicks interspersed with heavily phased and cleverly eqed percussion going heavy on the kick drum he patterns his jagged bass riff around the end of each bar throwing in the odd coin in and 1up nintendo sound effects before stretching out the scales with a taut synthesizer takes the computer game idea and runs with it making the dripping sound effects of classic hacker film the net s soundtrack bubble over his primitive bass work and human beatbox percussion the other tracks included here are versions of s zig zag release a reprise sees take the seemingly endless winding synth spine of the track and underpinning it with huge booming kick drums that unimaginative rework however is redeemed via heinrich muellers gravitaional take one of s heavily kraftwerk-influenced idols mueller adds a smattering of 303 and shimmers out a few other melodies in an effort reminiscent of neil landstrumms latest output
by ( k david lieske) is guided by a graceful melding of powder soft percussion and sailing chords it feels like a midnight row on a placid lake lieskes well crafted basics requiring no clever effects its protracted backing is the most arresting element with long doleful notes mixing and running like watercolour lieskes track was pretty spare but ( k peter kersten) takes it to a whole new level with asic percussion aside (miniature claps a swishing hat) theres hardly anything happening nd yet he somehow makes it work single sustained synth floats enchantingly through the tracks mid section with absolute grace judging by the title of the release the starkness found in both tracks is wholly intentional lower interests are the pads and basic percussion and the greater administration the duos careful sculpting of sound
the backstory behind vancouver producer third album is ridiculous but too ridiculous to be fiction daniel gardner found berlin unwelcoming and took an extended sabbatical to a remote island in pacific ocean where his long-term partner ended ir relationship day before she was supposed to join him harsh the result is a fascinating full-length with kind of ups and downs that youd expect from someone who spent almost half a year on a gorgeous tropical island in emotional turmoil more outgoing and less blunted than 2007s midnight black indulgence on scape marks ano r satisfying album from critically-beleaguered after ernesto ferreyras fantastic long-player as per labels usual m o its vaguely tropical and twitchy tech house the beats are padded and reinforced with an entire ecosystem of intriguing samples the free-spirited and playful sense of melody can easily work against album however cryin features cringeworthy orientalist flourishes (including a bizarre mumbled vocal) while slavic pastiche has ear-tickling chimes that pull track unpleasant ringtone-gimmickry territory the album also features a lot of gardners own vocals and his dry and detached baritone is bound to be divisive when its not serving to push groove along his limited range is painfully apparent the pointless vocal on has unfortunate effect of distracting from its hypnotic shapeshifting groove and 3d-popup plucked strings; conversely gravelly vocals on are more successful when yre swept up in rambunctious drum fills and undulating waves gardner is at his best when he channels his exuberance and extroverted nature more subtle focused tunes: packs a worlds worth of time-stretched and contorted sounds three minutes and jazzy undertones of are refreshing on an album full of hit-you-over- -head over tones the album is marked with sections of subtlety uncertainty and doubt where cheery facade crumbles; revealing moments like those turn from a bouncy tech house album to something more honest and interesting like any document of emotional crisis can be as uplifting as it can be depressing unstable unpredictable and sometimes even unsettling its an album-length experience that goes far beyond usual set of grinding tools even if it sometimes goes too far in its mission to be different
if you want to add legitimacy and history to your house music reference chicago or detroit in this case tim schumacher and aaron david have adopted the guise of a nod to a legendary detroit tv show of the same name that showcased local musical talent y even go so far to sample vocal clips from the show to add that special dee magic to their music thankfully this pastiche is a successful one opener is a club friendly workout with obligatory soulful male vocal samples rolling along the groovy bassline complements the low synth melody nicely as percussive flicks and licks keep things going three remaining tracks opt for a deeper vibe and are better off for it of note with its melancholy horn and lonesome vocal pulls at the heartstrings while still being rhythmic enough to be danceable similarly the swung garage beat on carries the warm pads and strings as they fade from one minor chord to another
with tundra lakker hit their stride delivering an immersive pleasure from start to finish now comes a remix package featuring the full spread from the discernibly floor-friendly stuff by acid and primitive to the more difficult revisions from the likes of raster-notons kyoka and mark was the standout from tundra and this remix by spaces follows suit except for a metallic undertone shared by both however their connection is basically unrecognisable spaces is the fresh-faced project from john flynn who debuted on bleep last year and co-produced a track on bj rks latest album vulnicura his remix is taught and choppy worlds apart from the eight-minute originals undulations between doomy timbres and shimmering choral nodes its pretty much the same throughout though eomac (ian mcdonnell from lakker in solo guise) delivers a ghoulish take on that isnt too far off for acid turn in a functional tough house number while newcomer lahun plumps for something more dreamy primitive makes the thunderous atmospheric into a tech house jaunt reiterating just how much tundra has been pulled apart and reset here for better and for worse honourable mention goes to lakkers dara smith whose arad remix is simultaneously true to the original tonneru and something else entirely hes so far released just one record under the moniker which was as beautifully produced and incongruent as any lakker ep so it may be too soon to tell what arads sound is exactly judging by this track however hes prepared to go in hard as nails if the situation calls for it

in the past rippertons perspectiv label has pursued a fairly wide range of music at least compared to its contemporaries theres been bog standard deep house clicky minimal dub techno and now whatever this is slathers vocals over gentle patches of cowbell and twinkly synths the singer sounds stolen from an indie band delivering simple and mildly catchy lyrics in the kind of deadpan dont care manner so popular these days with a rolling bassline it almost sounds like a more languid blue monday while the original is hardly maximal john s two versions strip things back further though still retain a surprising amount of emotion in the dub a thick bassline takes the fore with watery drexciya-like effects spinning around it to create a cloistered and echoing atmosphere the version with vocals feels appropriate for a much larger space leading with a short intoxicating bell riff discounting some barely audible hats a diminutive clap is the only form of percussion acting as a wonderful focal point both feel like products of some drip-laden underground aquifer last comes similar to s latest release on 200 records but with vocals as opposed to this time theyre sexier sung in english but with french (probably) sensuality soothing synth plucks and ping-ponging percussion accompany for a floaty mood
returns after a very nice release form the polycubist with another 4 tracker this time from the studios of give it up is first up and it gets the ep off to a cracking start with an absolute belting production smooth baselines work fantastically well with some subtle effected vocals and a smooth melodic line that comes in midway through alongside some great atmospheric effects a stunning production up in this f continues the quality with a techier production thanks to some quirky effects and bleeps and yet again we are treated with a smooth deep baseline that works very well a little bit more minimal then give it up but just as seductive turn it over and you first have table throb more upbeat then the a-side this production is filled with quirky cut up beats and effects and it takes a slightly more gritty approach midway in with a nice guitar like riff turning this into another top class production the meat beat manifesto remix of endless dub concludes this stunning ep off in pure style quirky and dubby as all hell early on the track progresses thanks to some eerie subtle melodies and a pure mayhem filled breakbeat interlude midway in this ep is simple brilliant it is not often you get a 4 tracker that oozes in innovation and unique moments all tracks are quite special and all are worth every penny if they were single releases a must buy ep for the house connoisseurs
were living in a post-james blake world of electr ic music; s proves it the debut from a young uk two-piece it doesnt so much herald inventive new artists than competent followers willing to work firmly within blakes blueprint after all with blakes collaborators mount kimbie now warp hotflush have to find something to replace them right whats so disarming about is just how much it sounds like blake from the arch but vulnerable vocals to the makeshift beat and queasy synths its all d e very professi ally but the nagging feeling that youve heard the muted organ and gasping synths be e is too distracting to take the track its own terms the title track the other hand is a dead-ringer mount kimbie right down to the industrial-lite popping sounds of that bands vertical and the pitchbent vocals to give the duo some credit their melodies are str g and they stick particularly the mantra-like on when that s g breaks into a trap-friendly snare rush halfway through its a genuinely surprising moment an ep that otherwise seems tracked the rails of precedent things end with the similarly hip-hop indebted based the same chords but now with e of our heroes valiantly attempting a full-throated r b vocal r kelly hes not and icarus wings come out looking a bit singed here but at least theyre trying which is more than you can say the other half of this ep
its been ten years since and made grimy dancehall history originally released on hyperdub in 2007 skeng slayed soundsystems back then and it still does today is no skeng but it comes close it follows up last years collaboration with d double e and riko dan with even more dread but it doesnt quite live up to the oddball box or the catchy iceman res a loaded minimalism to s flow along with his distinctive patois it resonates with s sparse swaggering productions isnt their finest collaboration though if anything its too bare-boned from and not as forceful from (compared with say dirty from angels devils ) has more fight to it featuring and spitting bullets over a chest-baring instrumental thats strewn with shrapnel its one of the best war dubs youll hear all year

the past few years have seen a certain style of underground techno coming out of sweden it features deeply mesmerizing grooves suffused with cool misty ambiance and tends towards irregular rhythms abdulla rashims stockholm based label northern electronics is the most prominent source of this sound and hypnus in nearby b lsta has also played a key role now a new label is entering the mix: nordanvind the brainchild of fj der aka ida matsdotter nordanvind begins with a set of heady atmospheric beats theres a track from the label boss alongside efforts from her compatriots nobodyhome and long form productions are the rule here with tracks stretching beyond the seven minute mark first is hypnus affiliate s its perhaps the most eccentric cut thanks to a restlessly syncopated kick djs will have to tune into the wooden sounding percussion and low growl to get a handle on it aka former minilogue member marcus henriksson gives the ep its most straightforward track with a gradually swelling 11 minute ride through thick acid squelches and fluttery synths fj der herself seeks out more meditative environs with the rolling percussion foggy pads and birdcalls of whos on a run of fine releases (check his fantastic remix on s recent ep doctrine ) offers an urgent darkly lit and typically dense 3/4 track it completes an encouraging first entry for nordanvind
after a debut release with drop zero which received warm praise this new label is back with a second offering from head-man first up is the original mix which kicks in with an electro-tech vibe from the start thats made up of broken percussive elements that begin to build while a subtle melody creeps in this develops further as dreamy synthlines take over the control of the mood and bring it deeper to a peaktime groove for the remix habersham is called into action and puts his stamp on proceedings in his inimitable style that holds an insatiable dark energy evident throughout as a rumbling mix of distorty sounds and mood synthlines
in 17th century japan prostitution was restricted to certain areas known as pleasure districts perhaps then the new exit offshoot is an outlet for and (otherwise known as jon convex and formerly one half of instra:mental) to indulge themselves the pairs heart drive podcasts echo the influential autonomic podcasts both musically and in form (theyre set out as a numbered series with abstract naming and aesthetics) and now has been set up to release music from those podcasts so far its solely been an outlet for and or for their collaborative alias heart drive and as you might expect from the name the music is wistful and journey like s begins with a sparse rhythm over deep sub pulses it has a sense of expectancy that gently resolves into widescreen pads and puffs of melody throughout the ep the melodic content is gorgeous and its made all the more alluring by its sense of restraint not to mention the level of production on everything around it is more epically scaled it joins a cataclysmic piston of a kick snare combo with a terse pizzicato synth line s percussion as you might expect from his jon convex material is more edged out and glitchy than s here is the nastiest thing on the ep fringed by razor edged sounds that snarl in contrast suggests wide vistas with its plaintive chords and distant vocal phonemes weve certainly heard this kind of thing before but its great to have it back
look at delicate pallor near effeminacy of danilo lessow on cover shot for his entry in k7s kicks series; cologne transplant is still pretty young and yet hes been on dance floors and home stereos alike from age of 16 when his cut slow as nverse cinematics opened up fabric 07 mix but it was with his w cuts series starting in 2008 as that lessow matured into a producer capable of muscular but elegant almost swoony deep house now lessows been tagged for his first commercial mix by k7 several years after his high profile and well not to toot our own horn but fabulous entry in our own podcast series mcdes debut follows as one of more intriguing in a series thats been on a quiet run since saturn ringed kosmische of holdens mix with notable contributions from kode9 apparat and wolf lamb/soul clap nstead of turning in a set of oddball disco finds or dusty house nuggets lessows clearly made a conscious effort with this mix to spotlight width of his influences though it may serve as a detriment to listeners who prefer narrative take on mix with ascents retreats and sly advances mcdes kicks is decidedly even tempered for most part lessow highlights formative influences and genres that were so instrumental in evolution of his more direct dance lineage and works as a kind of third hand thank you to jazz soul music and of course chicago house opening with bright handclap lined jazz of s to before quickly segueing to curtis mayfield crooning scratch remix of s lessow slowly patiently winds his way through stubby afrobeat of ny s warbling strutty house of mr and newer touches on those same sounds like whirlpooling synths and insistent pump of s after submerging into deep space hypnotism of hillippe s cortege s ace and op lessow breaks into light again starting with hand drum polyester disco of walter mix of ve beginning of most loose limbed passage one that continues and perhaps peaks with mcdes own l o v e though it streaks from stereo immediately as a lessow production a dizzying glittery bounce with a propulsive rhythm that takes cues from thriller era mj its a testament to lessows skills that it can slide so cozily into a love letter of sorts to his heroes and still highlight that very homage (its also easily brawniest beast included) n fact as he dries off to subterranean electronica of s and dubby twitch house of solees now classic refix of s its one track you need to hear anew alone devoid of sequence or tracklist binding mcdes kicks wont sway those whove proclaimed death of commercial mix but for rest of us collectors and home stereo bodies alike its ano r standout in a growing streak of kicks curios

made quite a splash in 2003 when his massive psiko garden exploded into the sets of many big name dj s including sasha digweed nick warren and countless others this time the impressive look to bring new life to this production with an edit and remix of this massive anthem first up is the john acquaviva re-edit now i must confess that john really hasn t done too much to the original in terms of additions but the edits and little extras he has thrown into the production are quite good the beats for the most part remain the same and a nice little synth pattern is a cheeky extra early on in the track it isn t till we see the main piano line that we see the major change where john adds a little skip to the pattern that makes it stutter along quite nicely from thereon however not too much is changed to the winning formula of the original on the flip though is where the real fun in this package lies with the very anthemic ashtrax remix expect some intense broken beats in the early parts combined with snippets of the piano line and some bubbly melodies a simply devastating baseline soon enters the production as this track hits full throttle and it combines quite well with the piano line a psiko garden vocal line is probably not needed in the production but it builds quite well towards the main and exciting feature of this remix that being the main piano line that has been reshaped and tweaked and it combines well with some nice melodic pads and uplifting effects the track takes some twists and turns too with constant changes in the arrangement making it interesting throughout a great remix by ashtrax has definitely saved the day in this release as the acquaviva re-edit alone was definitely not worthy enough to warrant a re-release but the b-side will definitely make a purchase of this release quite viable

released earlier this summer on the ever-consistent imprint the ep delivers a multi-versed original alongside a dance-floor focused remix from jamie jones that is bound be championed by all those keen excite the late night crowds shonky and cardinis original begins stripped back a deep and rumbling bass-line partnered only with cardinis spoken words and a subtle padded rhythm create a fairly sparse soundscape soon though the ne is shifted and youre rocketed wards tranquil sweeps and spacey over nes until you once again delve back down the stripped-back terri ry you found yourself within only moments before there is a journey be experienced here for sure but its a brief one as the duo purposefully upsets the groove throughout placed well in a club set im certain it could punctuate a moment in the night very effectively and manages escape being half-baked conceptually that is the jamie jones remix however is a full-bodied composition with dance floor relativity and purposeful succinct programming on first listen its bound grab almost any listener its not subtle nor was it created with intent beyond being anything more than a solid slice of music for a late night dance-floor harsh metallic warbled stabs accentuate the drums creating a brilliant throbbing rhythm over which a small splice of the despondent vocals from the original are looped polish off a well-balanced and haunting groove the intensity of the metallic stabs grow throughout the track and become increasingly detached from the time-signature hurtling the track in an warped and winding breakdown the magic of this remix lies in the balance it strikes: its ultimately a conventional piece of house music that has been worked and polished enough conclusively create a full-bodied and satisfying end result without any ambiguity or distraction on the flip of is the aptly titled coming its bleak and growling bassline xylophonic ambience dis rted vocals and moody over nes certainly personify the experience before a bout of its initial impact may seem underwhelming amongst a sea of releases brandishing these same over nes however its slow-burning qualities grow on you very quickly it s a nice addition rounding off a satisfying package
early 2002 chris brann through records presented delilah with b strong 4 me now nearly a year later this quality vocal tune gets a remix from two very important producers miguel migs and envy envy s remix was included on the impressive in house we trust 2 compilation miguel migs remix think west coast us house with entrenched guitar riffs jazzy solos and deep grooves the vocal of delilah is very powerful yet it remains low and innocent as miguel compliments her sound perfectly miguel migs dub i ve found that many dubs of late do a great job in maintaining the original remix and in most cases give new life as you discover different elements in the music the first things that are noticeable are the stabbing piano and short trumpet bursts alongside the bouncy melody miguel s sound is deep but remains quite refreshing in representing his west coast style envy deviation remix envy is undoubtedly turning everything he touches into gold this time he spins a tough firm house tune with melodies thrusting outwards and lofty synth hooks the bass has pulling power for those early morning sets envy deviation dub this time the dub feels quite minimal with a sample of the vocal echoing in and the lofty synths warming up quite a good change from the full vocal and still has the trademark basslines of the above

since began to create her own tracks back in 2003 the dutch dj and producer has established herself as yet another in an ever-growing list of female producers in a line here extending specifically to figures like tress barbara and mi whose work feels especially tender and evocative even when tailored for the floor often folding the cushy slowly-evolving lines of melody and a luxurious sense of space and tempo of classic detroit sounds into the headier deeper elements of modern techno s productions are especially polychromatic and wide-sprung no surprise then that for her debut album turned to s home to some of dance musics most consistently colorful and lushly psychedelic offerings the frankfurt imprint has been among s central release homes the last few years including appearances on both of its grand cru compilations the resulting full-length was produced over more than an entire year allowing to develop segue pieces to round out its few clamorous floor-oriented designs defined by herself in an interview with r as a very personal reflection of my moods and certain events in my life this extended gestation is one of the albums most commendable assets; you can hear the how fluidly and carefully it was arranged for leisure only the immersive melodic swath of 2007s has actually appeared before and perhaps tellingly thats also the records deepest most demented turn for the most part seems pitched to the home-listeners for those in preparation mode or simply those looking for a soft night at home those seeking the dense night-rushes of or the flush almost trancey hedonism for which connaisseur fans typically turn to the label may be surprised by its downy nature from the lush swirling downtempo of to the pink-dawn synthetic strings and bumpy electro of the beautiful a the records concerned more with the climb than the summit bookended by two ambient pieces s whispery tones and the slow water-drip atmospheres and springtime calm of closer margie muses more than it moves way is a lengthy gaze a long look around with dim distant synth melodies adrift in a steady four-four thump while the rushes of wind and fluorescent tonal play of find raise our heart-rates briefly in one of the albums few potential floor pleasures but isnt completely on her own for her first full-length outing shes called in a couple of friends to give her navel-gazing a little reprieve famed electro vamper drops in for the slow strutty ; her voice sang-froid daring and teasing distant against more of s horizontal strings and the tracks mannered house foundations antha igh-brow of throwback outfit the frank pop ensemble accentuates s aerial hover and sleek arpeggiated synth with a vocal just as full of wanderlust as the track beneath a role far more classical here than s but as i said these moments are merely transitional for ultimately how much you return to the album will depend on how wistful youre feeling how willing to indulge in s patently pretty brand of emotive daytripping
last month at londons corsica studios k sara chen held a launch party for her latest album she played uk funky techno dancehall and an instrumental of britney spearss gimme more at footwork speed s music can be similarly mercurial from the angular chiptune of her early releases to the techno of say position is another change: her latest full-length scales back the freestyle-inspired house of her last album erotropolis for a sound thats darker and more expansive the album speaks mostly to a love for the kind of club-ready hip-hop that has become a fixture of underground dance music radio (see the trap-inflected creep of a fidgety instrumental and the bassy bounce of ctual ) elsewhere recontextualises by placing his grime bars over swirling 80s synths reminiscent of a method used by mr mitch on the p money-assisted priority s connection with bbc zn network is stamped on the album the radar radio regulars one of whom coproduced are known for adventurous party blends dropping for example bollywood bangers over bashment chen hops across genres in a similar way longside grime hip-hop and glitchy tracks like and t match there are whispers of chicago house and the 80s synths of erotropolis the album has a few personal touches on a male acquaintance chats to her the albums artwork a stretch of great west road rendered in video game graphics reflects her west london roots her love of gaming a regular theme surfaces on several tracks including which has echoes of the gold rings on sonic the hedgehog for all that is as much about other people that extends to vocalists from to the lesser-known as it is chen herself s a soundtrack for a wide variety of scenes enhances chens reputation as one of uk club musics most adaptable artists
by now its difficult to trace the kieran hebden of pyramid or peace for earth back to the mellow hip-hop-influenced electronica of records like pause or rounds in the last five or six years hebden has become devoted entirely to dance music establishing himself as one of the uks most in-demand and adventurous djs whether through recorded mixes like 2011s fabriclive 59 or his sets at clubs like plastic people (where hes a resident) his dance floor presence has come to equal (if not overshadow) that of the music with which he initially made his name now for his first album proper since 2010s vibrant house-bent there is love in you (last years pink was mostly a compilation of previously released singles) is more indebted than ever to uk dance music is an extended tribute to pirate radio connecting the dots between jungle garage and minimalist house music in a way it recalls the klfs chill out subbing out that duos imaginary trip across the american gulf coast for a darker more hectic trip through underground dance culture opener buries the titular sound in frantic skips and bumps that owe as much to jungle as to the impure dubstep refrains of the last five years its clipped samples reduced to quiet moans is more bleak a chunky garage-based storm with a melancholic synthesizer and more of those mournful samples coloring the edges in grey and blue hues lead single charges through its warped blurts of noise into a fast-pitched hey hey hey sample that sounds like an mc trying to get a few words in uses similar tricks at first before presenting a gorgeous hyper-looped vocal that quickly gets buried in mechanistic twitches of noise and deep earth-shaking bass still manages a few of s more wistful retreats in particular is a notably persuasive piece of urban melancholia; the mc samples are there but pushed to the edge both and closer look back to the pastoral shades of steve reich and terry riley; the former approaches a kind of soothing mesmerism as its melodies weave in and out of time while the latter cushions another blurry sample which i swear is saying your wounded body feels with saxophone blurts and spatters of synth they close the album in a reclined stretch that feels all the more welcome after the dance floor ode that defines most of its runtime
fresh from signing and releasing majools buenos aires with rico tubbs ghetto soul on the flip presents yet another new signing to the label inviting 601 to provide their take on the two tunes in a release available at the website 601 are a relatively new group comprised of members nathaniel and sketchy who during their formative years toured with loop guru and worked with members of deep impact recently they ve also signed to canadian breakbeaters influenzas epidemic recordings for buenos aires 601 unleash a heavily syncopated breakbeat with funky rhythms aiming their focus straight for the dancefloor the original bassline is then taken to the 601 chopping board as they throw in short snippets complimenting each with electro squelchy goodness they ve taken to this remix like a rock-jazz outfit incorporating off-kilter drum fills which give the tune a studio session feel on the other hand ghetto soul has been taken down a notch compared to the highly energetic original 601 still manage to incorporate their very rock-influenced drum sounds but now theyve introduced their own bassline horn sample and electro hook its still good however what made the original pulled people towards the dancefloor (from what ive seen anyway) was its really catchy infectious rhythm and a theme that harked back to the days of old skool funk - something that rico is really talented at producing 601 have done a decent job with the remixes not too sure if theyd actually work on a dancefloor but would probably sound better if done by a live group - drums and all
with past mixes from the likes of ron trent quentin harris and kerri chandler the coast coast series flies the flag for what nrk considers real house music i e light uplifting positive music with lots of organic warm sounds and plenty of sing songy vocals t the controls for this instalment is baltimore s who has forged a career with partner spen collaborating on tracks by the likes of mary j blige kim english and kenny bobien while doing remix duties for everything but girl lenny kravitz roy yers and bob sinclair to name a few he also has a healthy number of production credits in his own right with no less than four finding their way here first half of the mix is a vocal onslaught lthough house lyrics can be cheesy at times ( octor can you write the world a prescription for change ) the groove s are infectious and stick in one s head with rtistic ft ursala s as well as s standing out above the rest here in this capacity with the warm up tracks out of the way the amazing of complete with killer piano licks makes a welcome appearance shifting the tone of the mix from lighter sounds to a deeper intensity transition to unfortunately doesn t quite work for me as at one point the bass simply drops away and any sense of anticipation is deflated quickly makes things right though with the introduction of his own t s m a proper party stomper which should work any crowd into a lather pace keeps up nicely from here with the feel good carnivalesque pasta mix of being a highlight s track selection is varied in tone and intensity with a good mix of soulful merican house numbers interposed with more edgier techier european influences sequencing is tight and the mix builds blows up and comes down nicely with s own a perfect set closer unfortunately he tacks on two more un mixed slow jams at the end which don t fit with the rest of the album and can only really be thought of as bonus tracks nother small quibble is s penchant for over using the filters/delays on his mixer a trick which sounds a bit amateurish when done too much se two points aside this is all around a solid mix with s own productions easily holding their own while it won t win over any technophiles if you re looking for a mix of real house coast coast will do the trick
sometimes the best artists can produce the most unexpected music it s often what makes them great and keeps them a step ahead of the competition imagine the surprise then on hearing that france s premier exponent of techno had apparently crossed over to jazz virtually casting beats aside full marks for originality and risk taking it s obviously not intended as music to dance to with only a few exceptions depending on the mood you re in rather than making those fluffy little clouds you see on a summer s day has produced some dark brooding thunderclouds garnier has opted to use a lot of improvisation a technique employed from the outset as a synthesizer wanders over softly menacing lower register chords it sets the tone of the album leading into the chromatic second track (titled 9 01-9 06 ) and then on to barbiturik blues with its low bass and faltering rhythm the mood is extremely solemn too witness a barely veiled tribute to garnier s fellow countryman satie in the accompaniment to a disembodied voice on first reaction finally the beats arrive properly but not in a way that urges you to spring up and hit the dancefloor controlling the house cuts loose with a minimal groove that hammers rather than uplifts then the more commercial (i wanna be) waiting for my plane marries rock and electro a man shouting i need to clear my brain if you approach this independent of the music garnier has made previously you ll reap the most rewards but even then i found it patchy and dark almost to the point of grim faced the machine s clouds setting in for the whole day an interesting diversion but one that is ultimately unsuccessful
heres the thing about gabber: its a load of fun its speed can be intimidating but you can gain a lot by yielding to its breakneck beats its fundamentally about unity friendship coming together with mates and blowing off steam its not trendy cool or intellectual and right now its a wonderful antidote to any techno taking itself too seriously cue s debut ep for its not gabber per se but it counts the style as a major influence a colourful and playful take on 90s hardcore its set to a techno pace we can all cope with hoover blasts and vintage analog sounds are all over the effect initially gives it a shameless retro feel but you soon realise that s tracks are more modern than they let on he isnt rehashing the past so much as using old tropes like putty stretching and moulding them into exciting new shapes take which sounds scuffed in a manicured way like denim ripped to perfection the middle rave stab is looped to delirium which seams to wear you down more than pick you up the same thing happens at the start of steekt which feels even more attritious until it lurches up a gear is the eps most ravey track with soaring acid crescendos (translation: nipple gun) is loaded with silly humour and is meant to be consumed on the dance floor without much afterthought it will get you moving while casting inhibitions aside
lets face it: early mornings suck but while font ns choice of song title may not get you salivating on this single the swedish duo of one and studio each make the crack of dawn downright desirable the most forthright wake-up call is the original which quickly sheds any trace of being a quiet alarm clock is basically space rock through a dancefloor prism it initially fools you with its soft organ and forlorn vocals from jesper jarold and johan melin then the guitar comes in takes over and hurtles it into the beyond careens through ghostly jangly sections resembling a montage from a 70s cop film crossed with the rocky horror picture show before climaxing in a full on rock out like pink floyd requires you to have a bit of faith and revel in the theatricality and (in this case quite restrained) excess if you can youll like this very much if the original is hawkwind ones rework is the doors its called a sun rework but resembles the kind of track youd hear at the end of a festival its like sundown the dark side of the sun and strange days all rolled into one one let a glockenspiel carry the main tune leaving the guitar to add emotional adornments its much slower and as a result the drumming more cinematic im the type of person that wakes up with a stretch and a half-hour shower so studios version most resembles my early starts the duo doesnt deviate far from their balearic formula here: is pitched down and stretched so that all the effects and vocals echo into the ether it lopes along like one giant yawn not that ive got anything against space rock of course but before 6 in the morning i like to take things real s-l-o-w
once again proving that he has a handle on what makes the dance floor tick like few others at present serves as a tantalising amuse-bouche for s forthcoming new album personality first half of is taken up by one of those cocky swaggering spoken house vocals that x-press 2 were so good at pulling off got the camera got the zinc teenage girls got the taste got the sex got the system atop snapping percussion and a growling gat decor-ish bassline n at the midway point it whooshes off out of the troposphere as frantic future acid meets prog rock synths and a rotor-blade rhythm its a track that revels in its gargantuan scale its backed with a non-album track ddict thats patently a legacy of s erghain residency this is music to be devoured at 4 m standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the like-minded in the middle of the dance floor its main feature is something that sounds like a thousand empty milk bottles being channeled through a sorting machine to which is added elephantine synth stabs water droplets and warm jets of fuzziness its proof that is adept at creating a mood without sounding moody
ep sounds a bit like motor city drum ensemble if danilo plessow like knew how to orchestrate a full band and stuff sam shepherd the man behind the project likes the same sort of dusty soulful house sound as mcde does on his raw cuts series but its smoother less overtly loop-driven the tracks on flow maaaan as the title suggests flows upwards straight into air the melodies reach reach reach until youre nearly ready to dive into the track yourself and push them where they so obviously want to go this sort of unresolved tension is where points k sam shepherd excels youre either hanging on to the edge of your seat or hanging on to your dancing partner waiting for the hit the same goes for and rgonaute on a more muted scale the groove is paramount the instruments locked into a bolero build that only rarely gets extinguished only to be built up again like plessow shepherds talent on this particular ep is in creating glowing bits of soul and then simply letting them run their course both producers often create more challenging work elsewhere but raw cuts and are a classicists dream
originally slated for release on a shelved album of remixed tracks from the xxs first lp this cover of one of the records most celebrated tracks is an interesting detour for art departments no 19 label a duet between martina topley- (of maxinquaye fame) and erstwhile screaming trees frontman mark lanegan the cover is a delightfully slow brew of rueful vocals heavy-limbed bass and chiming percussion the package includes a slew of remixes the standout comes from french producer agoria who keeps only the odd sampled snippet of the original vocal in a gorgeous deep house stew of warming bass and languorous piano frankie knuckles and eric kupper (in their directors guise) add a mid-pace beat and light chords making for a gentle elongated dance floor interpretation that keeps topley- and lanegans vocals in the forefront deniz goes down a more ominous-sounding route with her version which blends stark percussion with torrents of bass covering the vocal in a thick film of coal dust from which it never emerges

out next on chris fortier s recordings is a two tracker from with the quality of music on show by various labels at the moment it is no surprise that continue the trend with yet another solid release round midnight is first up and the opening moments are characterized by a solid kick drum and various effects and sounds the track builds in stature with a subtle baseline until it hits the breakdown where gritty atmospheric sounds unite in a quirky fashion the track hits peak time with a driving finale featuring hypnotic vocal patterns intertwined with the rich baseline the beats are a lot more quirkier in the opening moments of tempura creating a breakbeat fusion of jumpy beats and cutting edge effects until the production breaks down inviting a unique ethnic vocal and a stunning string pattern to unite a different vocal line enters perfectly forming with the beats and embedded baseline while the melodies and strings work their magic in the background a great and highly emotive production sometimes i almost feel guilty continually giving tracks great reviews but truth be told there is some great music out there right now this release is no different with two great tracks and especially the b-side shining amongst the current showering of releases
aka mat royall recently showed up on the radar twice in the space of a couple of days first on a young american label called headtunes recordings and then on londons mighty (of fabric fame) in the former case we encounter a monster track called schwing which you might recall from eddie richards fabric mix from a few years back in the latter case we find two tracks of even more monstrous proportions (if indeed such a scenario is possible) but it s the latter we are concerned with here and so we come to the point: keeping in line with the ethic both sides of s latest release (not unlike his releases on labels like absurd recordings and kgbeats) are pure party music plain and simple wino man is textbook tech house with an emphasis on the house it kicks in with a beat that punches and hi-hats that gradually accumulate as the groove sets in the near-deadly bassline when it finally drops down knocks the wind out of you and pins you to the floor (dance floor living-room floor kitchen floor - it doesnt matter) and then the energy keeps building effects weave about sounds bounce in and out and apparently there is a woman crooning wordlessly somewhere within earshot (and with just the right amount of reverb) eventually the strings arrive on top of it all shaping up some minor chords to carry us into the breakdown and just as we begin to catch our breath its back to the beat and the bassline and then its over and it was bumping rhodes to nowhere is tech house with an emphasis on the tech more mechanical than its counterpart in sound and arrangement it still relies on an expertly-fashioned groove to lock you in and keep you moving heavy beat and booming bassline is again the name of the game but this time a nice bit of atmosphere forms underneath and in between to help carry us along there s also a hypnotic pseudo-melody - provided presumably by a rhodes piano - that pushes things in an almost trance-like direction in the end the particular funk of the tune manages to keep it very much within house realms but be aware the energy level arrived at by way of this track may be difficult to sustain close attention to proper usage is recommended for suitable crowds and at appropriate hours only what it all adds up to is an a+ package and a great addition to anyones tech-house arsenal big sounds and high energy on both sides of the disc - you wont regret spending your money on this one and youll probably come to the end of each track with a smile on your face
toronto quartet azari iiis self-titled debut album has feeling a record youve already lived with a long time one perhaps you went digging a few days ago only to realize you never actually owned it not perhaps emost because bands elegant sonic homage to late 80s and early 90s chicago house but due more to ubiquity mammoth singles and the two were mix and set staples hedonistic summer oh-nine and latter has already earned enough stereo churn to qualify as a kind modern classic retro-fixation for this debut album on tigas turbo recordings those you who feel kind burned out on bands recent omnipresence will be pleased to find new gems snuggled within what is most part a loose-legged and savvy appraisal last 20 to 25 years house and electronic templates theirs is in whole more than a mirror act a sterile if energetic reflection music y grew up with in sweat and ecstatic after-hours recent single and album closer may be every bit equal azari iii jams that made albums multiple delays so frustrating over squiggly strobe synths a night-dizzy vocal moan and jerky bass bursts band cuts an an mic slice prince-like funk that far too many have tried failed to reproduce; its stranded somewhere between hyper-sexed strut minneapolis in 80s and so much dead-end zombie house this year its both nagging in its familiarity and pleasantly tailored to 11 elsewhere though band tries its hand at a series variations on sounds which yve made ir name acts like deep- - -night acid house with its electric fence breaks be e its short piano vamps let in a little light while and neon-technoid finiti ride a locomotive shimmy through detroits concrete empty-shelled urban dissolution the arpeggiated moan excellent dissolves into an almost balearic bit floating bass and pads be e retreating into e r again and is lost and distant an oil smear bleak aggressive techno despite its sensuous vocal cooing (for those thinking band was perhaps a one-trick pony its only throwback in that too closely approximates swoony diva house wed come to expect from m ) azari iii will probably be criticized its inclusion tracks that already feel kind too embedded in dance music consciousness to really touch us anymore maybe some will see it as ano r needlessly close-to- -bone re-encounter with houses history in an onslaught same but it takes little scrubbing at that revivalist surface to hear how much novelty azari iii have to fer here on old sounds and places those you disappointed in similar ef ts this year by hercules love affair or say jessica 6 will find many ir itches scratched here
f belgian is remembered at all in its mainly as a precursor to uk hardcore s the smiley euphoria of acid house faded a wave of mid paced monolithic tracks ushered in a darker era in british and european clubbing this collection of vintage tracks by the prolific artist rembert de smet k that evolution is clear produced quickly under numerous aliases de smets tracks fused ebms brutality with the groove of chicago house to produce salvos of suffocating bass pressure and fire alarm synths day they sound theatrical if not camp but in 1991 they were utterly terrifying s collected illustrates however there was more to than proto rave histrionics chronicled in the 013 documentary sound belgium this huge late 80s scene was in fact a vibrant confluence of genres and ideas t encompassed everything from synth pop ( ) to romping electronic disco ( ) in particular sought to merge electro pop burping acid loops and a bleak post punk aesthetic with a hip hop derived sense of funk n 1987 such tracks were defiantly weird day their hard edged eclecticism seems oddly contemporary could easily imagine ben ufo or joy bison breaking out the rt noise y or especially as a bit of end of set fun most of that essential material is on cd1 (or on the eight track vinyl release) first half of cd is dominated by mellower dub versions and dated ambient material ripe tracks like tickle me meanwhile prefigure hardcore raves cheesier tendencies nonetheless in this compilations best moments you can understand why optimos jd twitch ranks de smet as one of the top five best users of a of all time

s first ep since 2014 arrives on a leipzig-based label run by jan and steffen ennemann (steffen is also known for booking nachtdigital festival ) s someone whose club tracks tend toward icy synths and propulsive drum experiments is a natural fit for the ennemanns project ut what sets apart from most of his peers is the clarity of his ideas using only drums and synths s music resonates in a way that seems beyond producers who employ a wider range of tools on -seite summons his kosmische forebears in an elegant nearly ten minute-long synthapella seite is german for page (and for side as in -side) and as you follow the emotional changes in the music a story however mysterious appears to unfold s -seite makes serial transitions between chirping arpeggios and foreboding synth phrases the track slides from optimism into solemnity the sustained synth chords of -seite s mid-section and later on plucked strings with decays that hang in the air like mist suggest some unsayable sorrow fter a flurry of flute synths -seite which has the narrative structure and theatrical posture of an electronic folk song offers satisfying closure the title track though is a club standard: bone-brittle percussion (the snares sound like kung fu sound effects) brutal synth trills and a head-spinning breakdown s best club tracks rely not only on extremity but on a capacity to surprise without the regimented explosiveness of chappell or the astringent vertigo of tunsten the -sides dramatic twists seem more obvious
ep house is a description so overused in dance music that it has become almost meaningless but how else would you define the output tuscanys records (our latest bel the month ) sweet and gritty spatially open texturally varied meditative even it is deep house in the sense having emotional depth and intelligence that this stallions set a warm and pulsating fug eclectic 4/4 is far more daring than the banal music ten tagged as deep house is our problem not theirs perfectly weighted 55 minute mix (credited to the soundsystem a four man team led by label owner fabio lla torre) the first half stallions is reminiscent a dixon or michael mayer set s arent faultlessly beat matched into one monotonous groove but instead blended in grand fading arcs and clever transitions eerie library music samples and shimmering disembodied funk guitars and s melt into the suppressed agitation s by the time ifms heartbreaking usurps the monolithic of stallions is operating in levon vincent territory where new york house is reborn as a dark and clattering reverie ter the mix slips into more orthodox main room house grooves but theres nothing wrong with that when such familiar loops are sandwiched between the playful eccentricity lla torres edit or the evergreen bloops and blurts s that usher in the flutes and jazz funk references s to close the set tells you all that you need to know: the label is operating beyond genre distinctions and audience expectations in a semi detached world its own

san franciscos is not a name you might recognize instantly but its not for lack of trying: jason leder has been pushing atmospheric drum bass in the us for almost two decades now with a dj career stretching well back into the 90s leder is the latest to step up to the plate of ascs experimental series and while these tracks mostly stick to the established drum bass tempo theyre some of the most quietly experimental and elegantly distinct tracks of his career 5 1 isnt so far off from some of ascs recent output quietly swung drums and contoured synths bouncing between rubbery basslines part 2 is more assertive with techno stabs and a ropy bassline that uproots the whole track as it undulates while part 3 strips away the layers leaving just a bassline and coasting synth melody its part 4 that finally achieves the sort of deconstructed drum bass aims for a heavy-handed synth weeper that sounds like dbridge remixing enya s productions here arent always the most distinctive but 5 proves another solid addition to one of modern drum basss most consistent imprints
futurism seems less and less of a concern for modern electronic music similarly epic voyages to the edges of space and time seem less and less popular techno right now is about being dirty low-key and buried as far below the surface as possible not so toronto producer ranges far and wide on the four tracks here with a couple even recalling the halcyon days of prime planet e epic-ness melodic colour is a prime feature across this detroit-referencing ep with aurora borealis-style displays stretched out wide in open skies above rubberised basslines and voluminous kicks voyage starts with giovannis where multiple melodies rain down on taut darting synths rough-edged claps and springy supple bass notes s vast in scale and grandiose by design but never unnecessarily so with frequent collaborator and close friend is tighter with ditty acid blips and impish synths conjuring a mysterious air next is the standout track reasons : after two-and-a-half minutes of propulsive deep space ambiance some bleary melodies begin to brew in the depths floating higher and higher then pow y break out into a twinkly starry multi-focussed display soaring and swooping as bottomless techno rolls underneath closer brings you right back down to earth and stays bogged down in muddled drums and a serrated synth line grounds you perfectly before building up slowly once more ready to set off on another leg of the trip
next up on the us based recordings comes a release from production outfit the name of the track is and it comes with remixes from busy man chris fortier and the young american wiz ben camp seed mix 1 is on the a-side and its quite a dark and chugging production the drums take center stage with the deep chunky baselines giving the track a real low end sound throughout the vocal lines deeper in are quite unique as well as the minimal guitar riffs but the track is quite nice in all especially deep into the production ben camp really adds a unique element to the release with his remix on the b-side the beats are nicely paced and break throughout and the guitar like melodic riffs are very nicely arranged all throughout the track it s a very clever and unique remix and one that scores quite well with me really adding a nice touch to the release the chris fortier mix that follows is not as impressive as fortier s recent mixes such as his one on screen recordings quite minimal for the first half the track flows along with out doing too much until it hits the breakdown midway that sees the guitar riff meet the vocal with subdues beats creaking in the background some smooth atmospheric elements make their way into the track from here on helping the mix along nicely another nice release from with out amazing results but the ben camp remix in particular deserves some credit for adding a nice unique touch to the release
with a name like you could be forgiven for thinking you might get something like space dimension controller from this uk duo and in fact you do: theyve got the squelchy 303s and gleaming junos the lilting rhythms carved from analog machines and carefully cut breaks the same yen for pitch bend and ballooning filters none of this gets in the way of the records own considerable charms or accomplishments breaks with deep analog fealty by basing itself around a jittery percussive sample a kind of trembling knot of vibraphones that might be out of place in resolutely machine-oriented house but which lends a nice woody counterpoint to the tracks more electronic textures they trot out a range of chords and riffs that keep things floating on air with a dubbed-out snare break to add toughness its dreamy but with teeth the bassline meanwhile might move like disco but its got the buzzing heft of drum bass is tougher with slowly pumping dominant chords and staccato congas; the hi-hats run so hot that it might take you a while to pick out the clipped 909 snares jabbing their fists through the mix theres a strange rattling remnant in the tracks breakbeat foundation that can be distracting with a collision of frequencies that sets your teeth on edge but i think thats the point despite soothing chords and the blissed-out bent to the lead theres a nervous churn in the mid-frequency arpeggios that doesnt let up until the very end when it all strips down to rubbery bass and jabbing hi-hats and snares a tip of the hat to acid houses stripped-down insistence
to use a well-worn football maxim the latest from john talabots hivern disc imprint is a game of two halves the a si is classic house both slow and anthemic while the flip has its roots closer to techno and is fast and physical newcomer kicks off with which almost seems almost too slow at first but the illusion of the plodding beat is gradually broken by the accumulating rattle of percussive accents and the empowering smear of the choral un rbelly terlocking and jagged vocals gently raise the roof with a plaintive call an unusual breakdown seems to signal a premature end but rather than do the obvious and slam the track back in the vocals and beat are allowed to drift back before the real finale rebolledos mix hardly toys with the original keeping true to the pace while emphasising the bass at the expense of some of the vocal power mixes b-horror sound effects with war of the worlds shortwave melodies and a bubbling bass driven forward by a lovely subliminal fuzz wash basic s remix harnesses the rollicking energy of the bass riff and empowers it with a heavy kick drum and a hint of old school acid madness totally extroverted and peaktime it feels like the last panicked minutes of a cup final compared to the lofty dreams of the a si on the bench are the two digital-only mixes s own redux of falls somewhere between the melancholic liberations of the original and the more forceful dance floor friendly tracks on the b-si while basic s remix of takes the acid hints and turns them into a retro-styled squelch fest with big troit-style drum licks
fabric name is quickly associating itself with quality be it the club in farringdon or the c series that has been pushed by the likes of craig ichards james lavelle and now it is clear that we should expect nothing less than pure music quality from fabric second installment of the standard fabric series (not fabriclive) from is a worthy follow up to the very classy opener from craig ichards cd builds quite nicely with smooth deep house records such as s and the brilliant by as the cd continues the baselines get chunkier s to as well as the wicked asads silverlining emix of ark s is testiment to this s eeper and the soulful by harris close the cd off in fashionable style overall a great mix to listen to not hands in the air stuff but it never tries to be rather a good mix to listen to at home and relax too
a name associated with international deejay gigolo before general irony became its primary focus lilles terrence fixmer has been prolific this past decade with his profile recently rising after well-thumbed 12-inches on electric deluxe and turbo leading the a-side the title track is a slab of obfuscating techno that causes claustrophobic alarm via an assembly of raw-edged bleeps although a lack of punch means it fails to live up to fixmers recent offerings holding the stylistic pattern yet generally more spacious is further hypnotic artillery but again fails to truly ignite over on the flip wetyourself affiliate lays spoken words over the industrial romance of love sick its perhaps workable as a dj tool but judged as a standalone track is overblown and hammy
swedish artist michel is likely best known for working alongside varg as d r f d h s a collaboration thats led to around a dozen transmissions of dark wintry ambient and sparse abstract techno over the past few years including 2015s expansive full-length issued on hes kept a lower profile on the solo front but his own ambient productions are no less intriguing an ep for counts as s first solo release on vinyl like his two tapes last year for the rimini-based mixed-up shop and label these tracks feel distinctively warm found sounds and field recordings are put adrift among mellow melodic progressions and the occasional slow stripped-back percussive groove is a hopeful pastoral introduction with the gradual retreat of a rainstorm opening space for a chorus of bird calls and gentle piano movements (it seems to be a version of varseblivning from s 2014 debut on vargs northern electronics sublabel blod rn ) with analog noise whistling in and out of the mix strikes a subtle triumph when its meandering synths meet a raspy cymbal midway through reaches for maximum melancholy with where minor-key melodies find form amid a thick haze of high-tech drones and soft crackling effects the extra emphasis on sound design only amplifies the emotional impact out is overtaken by distorted synths as it moves between hypnotic despondency and a joyous sense of nostalgia before s panorama of airy playful tones winds down the ep all in all is another enchanting set of introspective ambient from this steadily emerging artist
you get the sense that portuguese trio produce more music than they know what to do with the act comprising sara eckerson and brothers ant nio and alberto arruda emerged in 2013 with a vibrant brand of improvised dance floor tracks for the lisbon label pr ncipe two further pr ncipe records followed as well as a smart two-track -inch for charles drakefords ftd label but s output swells way beyond those releases with jams spilling out across associated vimeo and youtube accounts also quietly launched their own label in 2014 with a stream of cdrs collating their studio experiments the ep is s second vinyl release gathering four tracks bursting at the seams with unpredictability while still serving the dance floor b-side opener jumps out immediately a mangled chunk of mutant house that fizzes with a kineticism that recalls jamal moss as with most of s music its not clear which member does what but sounds like they have some unhinged spirits trapped within their machines you could also offer jamal moss as a comparison for jord o a stripped-down production that grabs your attention with sinewy sequencing by contrast a-side opener t sounds like were trying their hands at straight-up house music rich colourful synths tumble out invitingly over loose choppy drums while someone breaks rank intermittently by going a bit mental with a cymbal could be a juju jordash track with a deep percussive throb keeping the beat while someone lets loose with an improvised synth solo that occasionally mimics a dolphin and another attacks some pots and pans it sounds chaotic but thats the beauty of
what kind of shelf life does a house or techno record have these days few weeks for a digital-only release maybe a month or two for a physical release or if it gets charted by a big name and included on a podcast or a commercial mix perhaps just a bit longer the notion that given the ever-growing morass of music and the increased ease with which it can be located a record can live on for nearly a decade seems outlandish s is one such aberration originally released at the start of the decade the simplicity of jochem peteris production does a lot to explain its long-lasting appeal ased on understated dubby beats peteri layers warm jazzy keys and a lopsided yet infectious riff over the arrangement then he sets it to loop for ten minutes sits back and witnesses grown hardened cynics reduced to a melted butter-like state would mean nothing if any of its components were anything less than compelling or if peteri didnt give the track the underlying swagger to carry it off luckily its got both the record features a remix by peteri himself as 541 which ups the tempo and takes it into a deeper more textured parallel space for half the duration but assuming it will appeal mainly to new converts the only version of you really need in your life is the original
it is about death a somber tom brokaw reports throughout this eps opening track a moody rework of raph el sage and relativ yanns the musical persona of a dude named - luccini soundtracks the chopped-up details of this story about death with the sort of dark pop and rumbling minimal hes dependably delivered over the past six years for treibstoff and a clutch of other cologne labels track thunders with leaden booms and tumbling bass lines but some zero-gravity ambience and a plucky melody open the curtains to let a little light in laying the brokaw samples thick goldfarb grafts on an unspecified dread but the aggressive brooding music doesnt need it and the effect is more a distraction than an enhancement worse off is a black vortex of a track hopelessly marred by more of the same samples clever editing trick goldfarb splices the previous tracks sensational news story with extracts from a commencement speech brokaw delivered to the 6 graduating class of florida state university in these small excerpts brokaw can be heard enumerating recent fads in lifestyle technology: myspace hi-def pd s musics unsettling low swoops not to mention the regular reminders that it is about death cast all this in warning tones ultimately though listening to the formal voice ticking off brand names and jargon proves tiresome and grossly undercuts the replay value of another decent track s much as im turned off by these overbearing samples though i have to say that the one track protected from them strikes me as the one with the last personality it keeps with the eps spiraling tension and low-lit atmospherics but this time theres not much that stays with me save the match-strike percussion
much like bruce and batu is an artist in bristols younger generation who studied in bath he debuted on brstl last year with a dreamy two-tracker that owed more to the easygoing side of bristols house and techno tradition: think outboxx and the falling up crew rather than livity sound but on his second release for moscas imprint things take a turn for the strange is built around a triplet drum tattoo and a bassline that crackles and hums like a dodgy ground cable throws in the odd detail an emaciated hi-hat here a pool of reverb there and a couple of times the track builds to a crescendo with layers of interference piling into the midrange before being swiftly whipped away but we always return to that simplest of kick patterns and handles this minimalism with style meanwhile recalls s forebears: there are shades of a made up sound in its soured chords perhaps and of pearson sound in its booming drums res quite a lot of detail to it rolling snares clouds of noise but they all pump and wheeze to the same rhythm its ugly but compelling and a promising new direction for
you can usually find on the dance floor during the final hours of the get perlonized parties in berlin for anyone who likes trippy house music the post-9 am period is unparalleled on a good morning as sunlight creeps in through panorama bars windows the tracks best served by zip get weirder as the clock ticks spend enough time there during these moments and youll learn a thing or two about what dancers need in late-hour situations so its not surprising that s music is well suited to these periods many selectors would consider his tracks functional loops but anyone who feels at home behind the decks long after peak-time has passed will recognise their potential you wont find many tracks better for those hazy moments than the of s first solo release since 2014 tough but breezy its a killer blend of chopped vocals bleeps and heaving bass the kind of tune that brings dancers on their last legs stumbling to the dj booth for a track id it doesnt build up or down but there are plenty of mini breakdowns vocal effects and clever shifts in the beat to keep the energy up and are darker but they feature the same low-slung groove and late-hour mood edwards remix of is the eps most abstract track with a stuttered beat and zapping synth effects
tenth release from dresdens collective feels like a nice summation of the labels work to date roughly its deep house but deep house that bites its thumb at anything too customary bill for example swaggers along with what sounds like a massive pair of scissors repeatedly opening and closing (its groovy promise ) y glisten brightly against the more muddled chug of the bottom end and make for something nicely unsettling s meanwhile actually sounds quite vexed mutating restlessly through a number of states from deep and airy to stoned and dubwise with some freewheeling harmonics sandwiched somewhere in the middle a grumbling 303 forms the backbone of with trilling keys and pixelated synths crashing in ever increasing waves unexpected is the voice that repeats im sure youll find this amusing but im afraid of the dark and so is the presence of such bright and optimistic melodies despite the devilish acid bubbles below surprises dont end there though because whod have thought c beams member s mysterious and radiant deep house groove tress would sound so good with a fractured garage vocal somewhere up top not me but thats what do best familiar things in unfamiliar ways

andr ss music has always had a timeless feel in the wake of new for u ras track of the year in 2012 believin reasserts this idea more strongly than ever this ep could have just as easily preceded new for u by five years as it could have been its follow-up goes without saying with a producer of andr ss pedigree that none of the tracks here are concerned with being new for u mk ii though his knack for warm disco-meets-jazz-meets-house is retained the title track is the standout s looping male vocal its only real point of similarity with new for u is joined by an equally uplifting female one as percussion and barely-there keys glimmer in the background the thermal bass melody and gently echoing drums of cant are the eps most subdued moment closer meanwhile features cosy jazz-bar ambience and gorgeous tumbling rhodes notes given an extra edge by a distorted disco vocal sample s hard to think of many producers who could make doing what theyve always done sound as exciting as andr s does on believin
simon and robin lee know what theyre doing as the brains and most of the brawn behind the brothers lee have been making faithful consistent disco homages for over 15 years n that time theyve shown themselves to be exceedingly competent capable of evoking everything from the musics r b roots to its spacier limits and even occasionally combining the two but is competence in and of itself enough to engage a wide audience in an artists work s latest album the self-released suggests that the answer is no a well-produced blend of time-honored riffs played on all the right instruments virtually every track on could make its way into a disco djs set many of them probably have already; four of the albums nine tracks (two of the 11 tracks listed are interludes) have already been released as 12-inch singles and they are unimpeachably solid lovin has superbly miked percussion; is energized by real purposeful strings; runs on smooth coursing keyboards each is guided by steady veteran hands and they are distinguished above all by their functionality n single form though the relatively anonymous feel of each of those tracks is forgivable for some djs it might even be a prized quality but over the course of s 50 minutes as each safe carefully arranged mix of disco motifs passes by that anonymity takes a toll does not luxuriate in space discos opulence t doesnt overdose on american discos glitz t doesnt revel in the campiness of self-identified disco culture a track like and for example has all the right elements of an absurd european space disco record: a silly choir rippling synthesizers a string section even some lyrics filled with trite intergalactic nonsense but the thrill at least for the lee brothers seems to begin and end in putting check marks in the appropriate boxes far from being invigorating decadent workouts tracks like and and are instead weirdly pat recently assembled a band to tour this summer and on some level that has to be encouraging recording a song in a studio to drop into a dj set is much different from physically playing a series of songs for a live audience who knows even though theyve done this for previous albums maybe this summer the lees will finally realize that competence is not a personality trait
as kate wax has done everything from spoken word to knife-style pop but the focus has always been on her voice piercing confrontational and elastic with her turn towards what she calls ritual music under her given name devi has kept the emphasis on vocals but re-tooled the spiky electro into more smeared forms of dance music never finds its centre pummelled by distorted and dislocated kick drums that sound like she found the scattered pieces of an old gabber tune but didnt know how to put them back together properly marked by bright pads and her own vocal gasps its a captivating mess that doesnt sound like much of a club track though thats perhaps what ivvvos remix is for recasting it as a shiny house cut the edge is sanded off her voice which is rendered childlike and soft on the more challenging side layers slabs of vocals that drone like a didgeridoo a product of devis recent training in tibetan throat singing its a little bit spooky and theres something hypnotic about listening to all nine minutes of it but the novelty wears off after the first few times on his remix pretty much ignores the original instead setting off on an equally long journey through sunny house vibes with its springy time-stretched percussion and jazzy bleeps it sounds almost like the chicago producer submitted the wrong track to an otherwise unrelentingly dark ep but its a nice way to wind down a strange and intriguing record
the names of s tracks and eps often refer to altered states outer space and spiritual pursuits his music usually brings a sense of wonder even devotion to these ideas on the excellent paraworld released under his ex-terrestrial alias for 1080p stargazing melodies new age chimes and campfire noise coated idm and jungle drums in decorating lo-fi sounds with several styles of dance music paraworld sounded comfortable and confident fter a rowdy debut on pron in 2014 feingold now returns to steven juliens label with another volley of decibel-busting drums and angular funk ut scension is some way short of feingolds usual standards the title track tries too hard to sound effortless pots and pans unquantised claps and overdriven kicks grind against each other and that skewed push-and-pull feels less natural than it ought to feingolds stringy funk keeps the music from falling apart but the self-styled cracks and tears could do with some finesse zone has an opposite and equally unappealing problem its frictionless deep house glide is a wishy-washy haze and the drums knock uneasily against the slippery surfaces zone and scension may represent polarised moods but both suffer from an overly casual approach

has always had a love of funk and jazz which is pretty obvious from listening to his previous releases albums like last years peace love music show how useful both of those genres can be for the london artist whose post-dubstep beginnings are now much looser on s latest funk grime provides the most ostensible funk but really the ps goal seems to be mixing genres ouble s vocal on that track reveals a playful ode to weed over the plaintive wah-wah guitar and g-funk synths it vaguely recalls the track that made s name in early 2012 although the rock drums here detract from the kind of swing ignition had is more grime than funk with a talkbox vocal as accent over a menacing melody syncopated beat and on his hustle flava s remix makes a ravey bassline number out of the sawtooth grime original has got the chops and credibility to get mcs like ouble and on board his funk and grime hybrids but theres a nagging feeling that so far after jokers purple wow period such overt g-funk references feel a little dated with no surprise delivered and when we know is capable of better swagger the p feels a bit deflated
last years fetish bones album from philadelphias moor mother aka camae ayewa was thick with emotion it was also complex politically charged and unsettling for this follow-up ep ayewa takes the same elements and collaborates with fellow philadelphian producer mental jewelry for another dark and dubby quasi-rap record ayewas vocals often elicit unease through their sluggish menace and weighty subject matters but gives her an opportunity to showcase a more nimble lyricism which is heard in the grime-like cadence of its also in the singsong overdubs of the opening track and s ghostly croon while fetish bones felt more surprising in its noise production and vocals has more obvious precedents such as the experimental hip-hop outfit d lek or kevin martin and justin broadricks techno animal project (ayewa will team up with martin and broadricks new collaboration zonal at this years unsound festival ) apparently and were originally intended for fetish bones latters rhythmic clanking and insectile buzzing would fit there but with bass wobbles dancehall sirens and heavy beats has a more primal if still artful energy
following a ten-year break a label run by workshop founder lowtec resurfaced in february with sword of light a leftfield house ep by a mysterious act called the hangout project now theyve followed that up with another leftfield house ep once again by a hitherto unknown artist: (or james cook according to the credits on the record) the similarity in style between these two records slow and spaced-out house plus one track over 140 bpm makes it hard not to wonder if theres some connection between these acts beyond being on the same label either way is another classy and laid-back ep from this resurgent label you imagine all the tracks on taking place in some vast abyss a cool wide-open space where their rhythms drift lazily by (all but one are below 110 bpm) slinks through its four-and-a-half minutes with little more than a few percussive loops juggling hi-hats snaps instead of claps occasionally offset by a lick of keys is a bit more fleshed out with twinkling chimes and a loping groove on deep sonorous melodies roll in like a thick fog further enhancing the tracks enormous sense of scale this one nails the vibe of the ep so thoroughly that it upstages the fluttering 144 bpm curveball that comes next when reappeared this year i said you have to hope theres more where this comes from now you can only wonder whatll come next
tel viv was a mini-ibiza in the late 90s told r last year its quite a small city about half a million people and we had about 20 clubs which could have more than 1 500 people on a night it was madness you can hear that echoing in both sides of his new single for other things echo too such as an ominous piano chord on the 12-inchs -side that stabs so insistently in the background it takes on the aspect of jagged tile drums there bustle and clop at an urgent pitch that nevertheless doesnt hurry too hard still the is the prize is your classic kind of looped vocal snippet that changes shape in the air as echo and filtering are applied to it at a steady merciless clip its language as hallucination; the kind of track winx made with 1994s hows the music as just one example of course the guy is saying the majestic but the shapes its twisted into resemble such huh gems as whip a jet pack and what would punch back bridge is provided by a pianissimo-soft peep-peep-peep-peep-people-people uoyed by no-nonsense bass rolling-clipper hi-hats that are replaced nearly two minutes from the end by soothing brushes and a taut beat its pretty damn surefire
luke abbott last worked with gold pandas notown label in 2012 he turned a musical corner shortly after and this debut under the name seems to be questioning that change of tack it asks what might have happened if abbott had taken the opposite turn: not towards 2014s austere improvised wysing forest but in a poppier direction the ep still plays out in a world familiar to abbott fans a sort of imagined norfolk full of bleakness and beauty most strongly evoked in the second half of the title track where rich synth chords offer a blast of chilly grandeur but mostly it hovers on the fringes of that terrain where it borders on the electronica of gold panda or the tuneful house of early 10s four tet is the most fully formed track and its got a gorgeous pop kick and are humbler versions of a similar idea: lilting house rhythm sweet-sad melody treated and looped vocals for a hint of computer soul its almost as if following a string of bold and thoughtful projects under his birth name abbott is enjoying being unambitious theres no harm in that particularly when the results are as emotive as the closer an effervescent new age ode to abbotts daughter
comes out swinging in with a simply gorgeous 12 of blissful heart on your sleeve music the a-side title track is almost seven minutes of gently sighing strings sweet melodic chimes and warm guitar textures all underscored by an insistent bassline and a 4/4 beat it s openly and honestly romantic; the track feels heartfelt and sincere in its romanticism not at all manipulative or calculating in a go for the heartstrings way a shining sparkling gem it s guaranteed to get a dancefloor both moving and smiling the three b-side tracks move away from the dancefloor with less noticeable beats crafted in a classic shimmering pop ambient style durance slowly moves forward with a slightly shuffling rhythm as a gleaming crystalline chime echoes in and out a lovely tinkling melody cycles around and around missing as synths sigh underneath and the beat gently sways from side to side closing track melanie is beautiful and haunting at the same time featuring elegant yet mysterious piano loops that skip up and down the register accompanied by glittering yet icy chimes and a simple yet somber bassline all three tracks are built to charm and beguile and certainly do the job for those fond of s gauzy romantic side is highly recommended

in trance circles gabriel need little to no introduction but what the heck ill do it anyway the san francisco pair are best known for s the rush comes which fused pop vocals with progressive trance and went all the way to the top ten of the uk singles chart latest single from their self-titled debut longplayer is another big cut destined for the playlists of trance djs such as rmin van buuren tiesto and bove beyond gabriel s original extended mix is a kicking piece of progressive trance held together by one hell of a riff and poetic lyrics delivered perfectly by male vocalist jan burton the effect is deep and soulful managing to be catchy but not cheesy but just when you don t think it could get any better an electro riff charges in guns ablazing and takes the dancefloor by storm as an echoing modulating bassline drives you further and further into a musical frenzy the discount acappella offers a raw and dj-friendly take on the jan burton vocals but its the slower cicada remix which is my personal favourite here it does justice to the original with a growling rolling bassline that rocks out like band night at the pub but also would feel at home in the middle of gatecrasher feeling of constant momentum further complements the sharp vocals electrifying riff and gritty guitar is not your typical slice of prog trance; its a dirty punchy crowd mover which i have seen devastate a room once again g d again raise the bar and give the dutch a run for their money can they really get any better
s first lp broadcast fell somewhere between the dubstep hed put out on punch drunk and the house music hed made with julio bashmore as velour it also belonged somewhere beyond the edge of the dance floor with shuddering beats and melodic arrangements that would have been suffocated by club speakers but floated airily through headphones other influences came through as well: the soundtracks of john carpenter the 70s krautrock of tangerine dream and the shoegaze of cocteau twins which gave tracks like phoenix and diamond islands a hazy timbre although it uses many of the same elements snaps everything into sharper definition there are still soft-focus moments particularly in the presence of vocals from new singer gwilym gold whose voice is multi-tracked into an angelic choir on northwestern passage or heard as a mournful falsetto on the downbeat four walls broadcast vocalist alison garner turns up once again on the city is ours overall the drums feel fresh and crisp and the melodies are bright and prismatic while still being predominantly purple a style invented by s west country compadres joker and peverelist those synths shoot like rockets and spin like catherine wheels over playing the game and lake rider while the vangelis stylings of moving statues spool into the same neon-lit territory as kuedos severant but where jamie teasdales vision unfurled in glorious widescreen sometimes feels as two-dimensional as the 8-bit computer games from which took the bleeps on forefathers things start to feel a bit samey by the time another glossy 80s synth pattern turns up on jam the network but most of the problem lies in the rhythms theyre just too clean to add any contrast to the incandescent melodies and sometimes lack the imagination of the other sounds dancing around them there are many occasions on when the surging synths sweep you along with the force of a dopamine rush but there are a few others when youre left with a nagging sense that could take things that little bit further
is the second ep to stem from meets grim reaper an album drenched in soupy electronics and ah lennoxs sonorous voice it also explored themes of loss and losing oneself daubed in the animal collective members familiar bright sonic hues mostly puts those self-reflective missives to one side and instead stands simply as a playful set of songs that apart didnt make the album is mostly cheery but the trade-off is the absence of the rueful timbres that on grim reaper songs like tropic of cancer and come to your senses play to lennoxs strengths of the eps three new songs holds attention more than sleepy marijuana ode or the squidgy almost-house of its drums lumber forward with a glassy-eyed swagger and the chords propping it up sound tipsy themselves vocals carry the looping groove home sometimes stretching vowels into a little howl of sympathy which first surfaced on a boxset of 2012s tomboy has a three-chord sequence that spins like a propellor lennox sings in kind lifting his rich tone until it soars over the sprinting drums it runs close as the standout
three remixes here: basteroid tackles cpu circus sleeparchive interprets i m so ready and ada takes a crack at combining both basteroid and are not artists who sit easily together s typical restraint is at direct odds with basteroid s delightfully incoherent maximalism as a result this remix feels neither one thing nor the other with a clanking ramshackle groove which nudges towards a bleepy peak but never quite reaches it sleeparchive gets a lot of stick for his idm-ish take on minimal but his effort here is a good example of how that style can be effectively atmospheric it s industrial in the sense that it sounds like a conveyor belt relentlessly moving forward with inhuman precision and has a real druggy bass-heavy intensity of course being sleeparchive it isn t exactly funky but then that s not really the point ada turns in the most danceable track of the three it begins with a gloopy bassline and simple but effective percussion but then rather spoils the effect with a fairly annoying house-y riff which feels out of place against the linearity of the rhythm track over time it develops and meanders with various instruments and melodies creating a spaced-out feel that might work at the beginning or end of the night but is a long way from ada s peak-time best overall an inessential release but the sleeparchive track is worth checking if you like his style
ficially the compilation marks the arrival s 50th release but it also un ficially announces the end the labels first chapter nowadays its run by with de facto frontman seth troxler having done like many rock stars before him gone solo what impact if any that will have on will only be known in time but its fair to say a lot has already happened since vq001 dropped in 2011 label l nched with a purple run tracks from the likes that output was fresh unique embodied a sound showcased here on disc one with tracks like fallin that troxler once referred to as underground pop what this compilation succinctly shows is a transition from those early tracks into more melodic spiritual techno this is the style that characterizes disc two thanks to efforts from notably draws more from tracks leading up to 2013 for good reason: since those first few golden years it has become harder harder to figure out s identity place epic ewan remixes tender synth pop lullabies spine tingling tech house are more faceless club ferings from a wider clutch artists maybe thats only natural if youre headlining increasingly oversized impersonal festivals or maybe it reflects how hard it is to remain original after 50 eps a string full lengths (itself a principled effort for a group who are basically on an endless tour the planet) s for the third disc stitches together cuts that didnt make disc one or two resulting mix is one restraint is the sound at its most deep late night re are no real fireworks stead its an undulating ride through broody grooves that should appeal to both mass markets more mindful listeners
if it was anyone other than id be calling the police to tell them about someone exerting classic homicidal and suicidal behaviour as that is how disturbing this release by the berlin resident truly is follows the popular love never sleeps as mr troxler or sex or young seth or space really lets his creative juices run wild if that previous release was a sexually provocative phantom inspired by long sunday afternoons in panorama bar then this one-track release is straight from the most obscure innermost alcove of berghain the inescapable throb from the first beat designed to blow speakers and burst ear drums is a trap merely luring you straight into the chamber of a nuclear reactor about to reach critical mass there is an explosion the sound of steam escaping and alarms ringing out but its too late its going to explode then a warped voice comes over the loud speaker; it was only a test and you retreat psychologically wounded and accompanied by the same thud that enticed you there in the first place for sure this track has right time right place only stamped all over it but that doesnt detract from the genuine creativity troxler so obviously demonstrates artists as carefree fun and likeable as he often have to work harder to be taken seriously in rebellion and in paradox to his own personality the darkest and most immoral sounding music imaginable is delivered here and to great effect
one reason s self-titled debut is durable is that paul kominek plays his cards judiciously that meant it was a listening album much more than a club one and these three remixes help make up some ground in that department the album version of is luminous and techy but scott reduces it down to a clear broth: synth pads and an easy groove reminiscent of detroit at its most plangent a wide-eyed sensibility that stays in line with s ideas if not his sound the skipping keyboard hook of s guided an arrangement that skips and hops with a latin tinge so osunlade is exactly the right person to make it over he nails the beat into place abetting it with tighter percussion (sticks shakers) and throws in a chanted vocal refrain whose backward-sounding aaaahhhh repeats through the track even after the chant disappears but the ep peaks at the end the original is late-drive-home music low-key and comfortable but john remix turns up the fog giving us about 1 5 minutes worth of classic dial grayscale before a machine-triggered breakbeat comes in and throws it under a slightly different light chops up the beat for a while then breaks down to faded cello sawing under the keyboards
the quick rise ristols emphasizes continued importance geography in internet age few months ago he was virtually unknown outside bass-obsessed city now hes had three releases on various ristol labels and suddenly received attention from all corners expansive dubstep world his effort for equally fresh-faced label (helmed by ristolians loodman orphan101 and headhunter) is best three and though hes clearly still finding his feet graceful movements and are enough to distract while he keeps looking s cheery but reserved melodies are an interpretation ever-potent tropical aes tic as viewed from window an english bedroom touched with an unmistakable note melancholy is so buttery smooth its a wonder that it even stands erect every sound is a sustained whoosh; even drums sound curiously slowed ts a mesmerizing sensation that feels like skating on pudding and chilled-out vibes are complemented by tinkling piano trills t leans dangerously close to chill out territory but n again its hard not to get comfortable when youre sitting in a room made entirely pillows uses a dash more force but its swing is mellifluous and beats hit s tly pitter-patter raindrops falling on that aforementioned bedroom window while hes not exactly ready to set world on fire is finding his way re and tracks like se are a decent start
on the night of november 13th 2015 paul r gimbeau sat in his studio in paris and began making music as for the first time in over a year that same night coordinated suicide bombings and shootings including one at le bataclan during an eagles of death metal concert killed 130 people across paris and the nearby suburb of saint-denis following the release of 2014s had s a record that forged the darkest parts of industrial techno and metal into a sound as evil as its title r gimbeau had spent time working with other producers and playing in bands but that evening he recorded what would become the opening track of his latest album they fall but you dont taking his usual grizzled textures and stretching them out over eight ominous minutes the idea of r gimbeau embarking on a sweeping ambient record during the paris attacks recalls the electronic music folklore surrounding william basinskis the disintegration loops shortly after completing the album basinski played his decaying loops as he watched the twin towers burn in the manhattan skyline whatever the context wading through they fall but you dont s sea of frothy distortion feels like navigating some great emotional current passing through grief anger and resolution the first half of the album split into six parts each prefixed with vivere talian for to live takes s familiar palette of dark colours and prickly textures and splatters them onto ambient canvases choppy modular sounds like the thwack of helicopter blades turn almost deafening over funereal melodies on the second part elsewhere the sounds descend like a smokescreen or swell gradually in the vein of the doom metal band yob by the time you get to the fourth movements nine-minute drone they fall but you dont can seem oppressive but its worth being patient: the hopeful turn at marks some of the most beautiful music r gimbeau has ever made t begins with bright melodies before transforming into a beautifully exploratory section redolent of the ambient passages of david bowies berlin trilogy n the finale a child chatters away in talian as a happy refrain bubbles up bringing the album to a feel-good denouement a veritable hollywood ending those final passages present a wider emotional range than any past work where r gimbeau has long been obsessed with the darker corners of dance music here he looks past the fire and brimstone at what lies beyond those negative emotions the redemption that can come after reckoning with pain theres a poignancy to they fall but you dont that makes it almost operatic in scope and cinematic in power
first a little dutch history-linguistic lesson the word paling means eel and when smoked it is considered a bit of delicacy in holland it also refers to a classic style of pop music that came to prominence during the 70s originating exclusively from a single harbour village in the north of holland called volendam palingsound (as its called) is a huge thing in holland anyways but its not clear what it means here what we know about this record is that its a new venture from rotterdam a little internet snooping reveals the artist responsible to purportedly be a respected dj in the citys underground techno scene amsterdams rough-and-ready sparring partner has long since moved on from the gabber heydays and though its still no match for the sheer glut of electronic music available in the dutch capital rotterdam has contended by keeping its head down and not really giving a damn its the kind of attitude that comes through on : no track names or frills just jacking techno with a hefty dose of gritty ghetto spirit the a-side opener feels like its been taken out of a deep freeze with crisp piercing details then we get a squelchy electro-techno build before things take an acid turn on the flip the first tune is a classically vintage number after which the ghetto-house kicks in to close with another cool fidgety acid stomper the title implies that theres more to come so let the new palingsound revolution begin
its hard dislike shes part a small club former r b/mainstream dance starlettes who ditched the industry do things their own way she even started her own label make sure no one would tell her what do ever again in many ways her perkiness is quite similar fellow scandinavian electro-pop heroine annie except a tad less sass and (probably) more money after a 2005 eponymous album that reintroduced herself the world and after collaborating everyone from royksopp and teddybears snoop gg and kelis is back body talk the first album a three-part series it opens up nt and two pieces dys pian pop a slightly abrasive edge from the repetitive almost tedious lyrics the former the harsher synth lines the latter there is something strangely cold about them as if was trying a bit o hard animate said fembot its an introduction which is all the more puzzling when you listen the two straightforwardly heartfelt ballads that close body talk ( with and ): the brusque passage from one the other suggests an artist not fully at ease yet her schizophrenic pop persona thankfully whats in the middle is much more satisfying on is by far the best thing has ever done in its squashing bittersweet languishing love and the cathartic function dancing a disco-pop beat hall produced diplo has an immediate air reggae-lite joviality while the royksopp-helped them comes across as a darker companion last years the girl and the robot that said just three truly distinctive tracks out a 30-minute long album is stretching things a little thin isnt it with any luck the forthcoming parts the series will help put everything in perspective for now body talk pt e is a lukewarm comeback
viennas young label occupies a space in which forgotten old post-punk and industrial records are near-indistinguishable from new ones ( the record it mostly focusses on new artists while its wiener brut sub-label reissues relics from viennas 80s diy scene ) goes one step further in its best moments this was the case with leo james what happened to you p where compelling rhythm tracks balanced post-punk credentials with an odd airless funk its the case again on the lead track of -moon an p from an established artist working anonymously as theres a time slip in -moon which couldve been made at any point in the last 30-odd years theres also a place slip in the strange monologue running through it with an accent that sits somewhere between the uk the us and some imagined class of stylish uropean kids singing in nglish theres a slip of mood too its surreal parade of images squirrels a battle dog the seas of galilee seem to veer between joke threat and something harder to define underneath bits of percussion and coarse synth coalesce into an irresistible 120-bpm slouch sheila drops the tempo for a pair of scuffed drum tracks reminiscent of tolouse low trax (the salon des amateurs resident has appeared as a remixer on before ) g is a controlled avalanche of kitchen sink percussion while a trudge-a-thon generates low-level panic with seething layers of arpeggiating synths
fingerlickin label heads justin rushmore and jem panufnik are on target in the breaks firing range with this release showing us they can do more than just run a label they can pull out some breaks tunes as well side a dirty waltzer interesting title of a track thats not even in waltz time (which is usually 3/4) but its hella dirty the bassline just makes you feel filthy as it has a very acid housey feel and takes us back to the time when (dare i say it) big beat was mainstream acid house rave sirens big beats and funky breaks all mashed up into one track and you get the head nods and ass-shaking for free side b get it girls this side is really a b-side one of those tracks which isnt as good as the a side more of that 303 acid squelchiness that fatboy slim made so popular back in 95 but this track does get a little boring as the bassline just keeps repeating all the way throughout (apart from a few breaks in the middle) if you can sense that everyone in the club is way off their chops then it would be recommended to drop this one if it wasnt for the a side this vinyl wouldnt even be worth getting however dirty waltzer is a damn funky ass track while get it girls just gets too repetitive the 12 comes complete with tasty fingerlickin artwork from jem and this time it depicts people having a mass orgy in a sex theme bumper car ride with illustrations around the side naughty naughty boy jem
maya medvesek a london-based dj whose production career began in earnest as 8 ch recently renamed herself and the new guise fits her technoid bass music productions far better than her original moniker fast-paced and futuristic but never aggressive medveseks sonic interest is midnight music that washes over a crowd and pulls the evening forward her first release for another energetic startup has moments that are sure to heat up an evening but one senses herself is still just warming up pre-name-truncation joy orbison hangs heavy over : in terms of sonic quality matches its forebear but i wish she had the same knack for structure that makes a record like shrew would have cushioned blow a permanent fixture in many bags put simply its too short is unquestionably the jewel of the ep a classy nugget of quiet synthetic rhodes chords and insistent low-end tiny yet fully formed its surprisingly and unassumingly dangerous a bomb that fits in your pocket if is a rookie relatively speaking it shows on the b-side drifts unwisely into trance clich s and stalls outs reassembles the deep medi back catalog without its soul s distal-ish remix of turns in something more obviously intense than of the original and while its not bad i think the original has more to offer
if ever there should be a museum of tech house kick drum sounds the one from s should go somewhere in the collection its one of those almost impossibly vacuum-sealed kicks that stomps and snaps all at once like a computerized knock on a door mixed with the sound of someone popping the bubbles of that plastic packing material that provides so much joy to dexterous children its also one of those kicks that manages to command a track even after all the other parts build to a sort of frenzied din over top makes a good game of arranging those parts some of them jazzy (simulated spacey electric piano jamming burbles of bass that sound like they couldve come from an upright) and some of them right down the middle of the tech house lane the -side sashays more even as it scans as more dark thanks to a loop of what sounds like a demon saying yeah after getting serviced by someone he just met at a bar up and running follows in a slightly more minor-key mode with a moodiness that suggests good things in the way of range but a same-ness to the beat that keeps it from venturing into truly new territory
news of alexander neumanns retirement seems to have been a bit premature neumann simply keeps on releasing records typically on the surface is varied to the point where youd think they were from different producers if you didnt know better but dig a bit deeper and threads run throughout both and would be great early night cuts and the former is the highlight of the ep with shiny arpeggios changing speed playfully from a stoic base tempo to manic casio rippling all over an unhurried hip-hop beat the latter is stripped down based around rattling shaker percussion and with a low volume sub bass bobbling underneath and some unassuming piano chords the same roughshod aesthetic is followed in you except this time its more open a lot more rapid and with a pumping kick and languid chord throbs its also got the same husky male voice as in again repeating the title phrase its a lot more frequent this time though and begins to eventually grate in the same frantic kick and tempo is followed (some 130 bpm) but its all melody a lovely pearlescent blend of synth lines including a dazed squawking which takes it all away with the fairies its strange and wonderful and itd be great in the chillout room (if we had them anymore that is )
detroits manuel gonzales is the latest to bring his frayed wires to trilogy tapes will bankheads uk-based nursing home for frazzled house and broken techno wild oats producer responds in kind with some of his most fractured material like his past work theres a distant rooting in techno but more than ever he lets his ear drift to more abstract places starting with the imploded funk of lting synths are smeared on a rhythm that sounds like it was lifted from a disintegrating record a subtle chaos where elements double up and hats spit out almost at random takes it a step further like a drexciya outtake rerouted through the sewers instead of neptunes lair and builds and dissolves a classic detroit techno riff under the thumb of an all-consuming kick drum and some rather unnerving scraping all that extraneous sound falls away for the crunchy flutters which sounds like the charred exoskeleton of its predecessors could be that tracks missing high-end bleep techno in the most literal sense of the term all of these tracks offer heavily lo-fi takes on recognizable house and techno forms a theme which by now is par for the course more than anything but theres something almost aggressively grungy about these tracks and its the odd one out on the ep which best spells out why theyre so appealing isnt so much a techno track as the cheapest most filthy disco-style edit you could imagine a jefferson airplane sample gets chewed up by static so that the folky mumblings resemble a beat shorn clumsily with a dull knife mystifying frustrating and tantalizing all at once is a lot of things but never boring
the a-side opens with the original mix of radio which is a straight-up european electro track that kicks off with some ruptured beats and the appearance of a teetering synth these fragmented beats get some bulkiness when the fat low-end of the piece emerges along with a domineering lead synth lending a nasty nitrous feel to this shock-rocker this is pretty much the form throughout with the components getting tweeked within an inch of their life to add to the whole contentious vibe this is artificial pop for the new millenium and you can imagine some serious shapes being thrown to this one by cavorting creatures of the night on a dark sweaty floor definitely one that might land itself into a tiga set and should see support from the other electro gigolos pushing those sleazy sounds such as hell and the hacker this is disco jim but not as we know it (7/10) the oliver koletzki remix is the second track on offer here and this is more of a minimal stomper without the glamour-glitz of the original the teetering synth is kept but only fades in and out occasionally and is used a little more sparingly while a cheap clavius sound faffs about creating an interplay with the nominal rhythm adding a small element of cheekiness a spaced-out feel is added by using some sweeping whooshes while the mid-range gets a makeover with some reverb and delay not a million miles from the tiefschwarz material we have come to know and you can see why uncle sven has been keen to bring this guy into the cocoon clan - indeed his muckenschwarm ep was very well received in certain circles last summer all the right ingredients are here for a considerable impact on the floor (8/10) on the flip t v is a sinister little number that almost stalks you like a stealth assassin minimal drums that incorporate offbeats kick the track along which seems innocuous enough until this morphing twisting killer synth brings a minatory air to this affair theres no escaping the darkness with this one apart from a brief lull 3 minutes in when that foul synth subsides but it soon re-emerges and it aint over yet no real bassline -- but plenty of mid-range and synth like most electro -- and a hint of darkcore makes for some real speaker-freaker action this track which runs a close race with the koletzki remix as my personal fav in this package draws a correlation to some of thomas schumachers recent work for its warped-electro sound peak-time stuff (8/10)
the concept behind style upon styles bangers ash series is frankly inspired for each instalment an artist is asked to service two distinct crowds: smokers on the a-side dancers on the b these days of course theres plenty of overlap between the two a point that judging by his releases on further opal tapes is keenly aware of the a-side kicks things off in very fine style though if this is smoking music then its the soundtrack to a comically unpleasant whitey sound like zombiefied relics from hip-hops golden age their dust-ravaged beats beset by helter-skelter synths muffled drones respectively and is dub for windowless basements an utterly graceless beast whose periodic bursts of sub-bass border on oppressive the appeal of these tracks is partly their stylised purposelessness; in contrast the b-side is positively surgical in its precision s bassline swoops under sculpted sheet-noise while is slower weightier its clipped groove evolving hypnotically over an oceanic dub techno chord the latters undulations of intensity make it almost peak-time fare but a rather brutal mixdown razor-sharp highs liberal compression doesnt work in its favour still if wed wanted prettiness we wouldnt have asked bat to the party would we
an unannounced release arrived at the end of december right about the time many of the labels fans were nursing christmas party hangovers the unusual timing is becoming a pattern about 12 months ago it was rareshs vivaltu remixes and two years before that it was petre inspirescus gr dina oniric now we have from dan andrei a producer whos been aligned with rhadoo raresh and petre inspirescus label since it launched in 2007 at eight tracks long its the most substantial and experimental release by anyone other than inspirescu making it an important moment in the labels story dan andreis sound has evolved with each release every outing has had a distinct aesthetic with excursions into crunchy house tribal and lean dubby fare more recently hes been working with a melodic synth-heavy palette and the results have been mixed: last years track on a compilation for nsual records was borderline annoying and his appearance on vivaltu remixes felt uninspired next to efforts from ricardo villalobos and petre inspirescu but it seems like these spacey productions were stepping stones to the mature sound of (meaning cosmos park ) which is the most varied record has ever released synths synths synths has loads of them they range from the abstract and glitchy ( ) to the melodious and melancholic ( ) and present a range of feeling not present in andreis more pared-down work andreis advantage here is that hes not concerned with making dance floor tracks on we get electro and experimental house connected by crisp breakbeats and glossy synths its easy to picture the founders doing damage with tracks like ntoarce and f r is an album few people would have expected from either andrei or but as a new wave of romanian music breaks away from the countrys established minimal blueprint it seems possible that more albums like will arrive this isnt s strongest release but when its all said and done andrei reminds us why his music played a vital role in reinvigorating the minimal sound
though it was the carbonated funk of his remix of un lds s p what e doing that first alerted the world the talents of londoner it was a series of sonically evolving eps between 2009 and 2010 on hemlock r s and hessle audio that cemented his reputation as one of the more inventive producers emerging from dubsteps mutation blake largely followed that remixs lead for cmyk and the slightly more refined tempos of bells sketch fuzzy vocal samples pitched almost in song above chunky if increasingly minimal dubstep beats but his next two releases klavierwerke and his cover version of feists late last year showed just how far blake had already begun move from the blurry soulful brand of bass music hed made his name on eschewing samples for his own voice the former embraced minimal rhythms and melodies working for a kind of haunted spiritualism latter was a cavernous take on r b blakes voice left without cover over mournful piano and slow pulsating bass t was a daring moment for the young producer sure this relative forsaking of a sonic brand hed quickly but effectively established; but one that wouldnt have been nearly as effective if the track itself werent well kind of devastating arrives not surprisingly as the direct descendant of his last two releases a sort of electronic gospel record blakes mining ambient r b the woozier ends of the uk bass spectrum and the desolate indie strains of acts like bon ver and an ny both of whom hes certain be compared for the tenor of the records vocals but also revels in its own willingness subside a patterning of shady hushed beauty that withdraws itself from focus as often as it asserts itself this isnt a criticism per se ts a testament blakes taste for texture and his appreciation for near-silence but it also often makes him seem somewhat elusive along with the feist cover (included) is one of the albums more immediate delights a droning wash of ambience and sly synth melodies that seem almost swirl beneath one of blakes crooniest moments spare brokedown blues of the two s featuring only blakes shaky voice porchfront guitar and the most restrained rhythms all slightly static worn are just as immersive but belie blakes forlorn textures with a chorus that sounds almost redemptive asurements meanwhile sounds like jamie lidell gutter drunk and appreciating a new dawn while and are slightly beefier returns his origins their slow clunky beats gaining in sound around blakes vocally effected cries but while its tempting congratulate blake on the rapidity of his evolution and the singularity of his voice hes not exactly working without recent forebears res an undeniable link the lone cabin isolationism of several of the songwriters mentioned above shorn of musical distraction and paced recline beneath blakes adoration of r b and dubby mesmerism what blake sacrifices in songcraft he makes up with graceful often breathtaking atmospherics but its that very delicacy of his structuring that makes his songs seem so ephemeral and ugh embrace by cushioning his songs with so much space even a use of silence as articulate as blakes he often undermines his own subtle hooks in a way that artists mining similar terri ry like nicolas jaar or how dress well dont is a promising debut for the producer without question but it also represents somewhat of a missed opportunity perhaps one thats underwhelming at its worst and absolutely transfixing at its best
though is from michigan he currently crafts his analogue techno workouts in austin texas its clear however that hes still indebted to his time spent partying during detroits 90s heyday across a handful of e s for other heights and dolly hes mostly channelled detroits second wave the muscular synth jams of carl craig robert hoods loop-driven minimalism and his latest for london label release/sustain stays resolutely on home turf and both ride wiggly subs through filters that veer between shrieks and growls occasionally supplementing the low-end workouts with a flash of pad or in the latters case a call-and-response synth line is more sweeping its simmering riff threatening to boil over as its buffeted by claps and kicks it evokes of carl craigs sparkle but without the emotional clout all the originals are neatly executed and so polished they gleam but they feel like theyre building to a pay-off that never quite arrives fred s take on is typically deep it emerges in a flurry of echo its hi-hats and snipped vocals chasing each other through subterranean bass for the e s most interesting moment everything else here is functional and deserves its moment on a 4 am dance floor but ultimately mosher might need to lose the hometown blinkers

m geddes gengrass latest full-length as his techno-oriented alias is well-executed tasteful and sober too sober actually while the craftsmanship and structural ingenuity are unimpeachable whats noticeably scant on s four productions is the very thing that has made the los angeles producer and modular-synth badass such a singular figure in diy electronics: his trippy technicolor sense of eccentricity constructing rhythmic schemes from the strangest of vectors while blending textures of extraordinary dissimilarity gengras has let dub bleed into ambient ambient soak through techno techno bubble up through kosmische and on and on jump into his jungle of a catalog at any point whether his early cassettes for stunned records or his collaborative work with sun araw and the congos and those alchemical properties are never anything less than rich and pungent picking apart will reveal some characteristic mind-altering moments; the problem is that there arent enough to invoke a transformative listening experience a distinctly detroit-flavored cut cruises at a smooth sub-130 bpm without much textural impact or propulsive force then during the closing two minutes flakes of percussion break off and orbit around the core cluster of snares chords and kicks and its far and away the best part significantly more moody is the 12-plus-minute title track it boasts a brief but potent midsection of analog fizz and deep resonant bass with a digi-dub feel and the sounds collapse like earthen roots and rubber-coated wires all coiled together the closing comes swathed in dense staticky sheets of atmosphere that recall gengrass underrated drone-rock project robedoor but these are just glimpses and flashes in tracks that altogether dont possess much immersive wonder they do what they do competently yet predictably in a way its not surprising doesnt have more of gengrass freak flair as has become more and more conventionally techno over time on 2012s alternate/other and spontaneous generation all manner of brash cross-pollination hurdled from the speakers 2015s new lines and now feel almost orthodox in comparison instead of approaching techno tradition from the outside gengras is working within it if that helps to explain why the music isnt pregnant with weirdness it doesnt justify the lack of vibrancy in its beats the title cut of spontaneous generation for example is 20 riveting minutes of sweaty groove research all forward movement and dizzying synths with zero hesitation theres no groove on expending nearly that amount of energy with its fidgety nervousness and shuffling syncopation has a decent amount of swing but still feels somewhat wooden if gengras plans on penetrating deeper into techno proper hell have to find better ways to enhance the rhythmic intensity as he sticks to the genres parameters thats no small feat

brightons has a dramatic name with echoes of wild beasts and viking feasts and his music follows suit moves with a combative swagger emboldened by thick bass and punchy drums punctuating its ungainly groove with woozy scraps of rap puts the extreme syncopations of footwork to work in a tune that otherwise recalls gerry reads jazz-sampling house jams with so many different drum lines running so perilously out of sync it feels like it might go spinning off its axis at any second but soft piano chords and a gliding lead help maintain a sense of balance slower and more straightforward dont struts like a peacock brandishing rich rhodes chords and metallic accents above its sternum-thumping bassline and pitched-down vocal samples; its like the hard-knocks version of hip-house bloodied but unbowed finally gang take the opposite route with their remix of wrapping splintered percussion in soft chords and staccato piano melodies to quietly quixotic effect
s last record released on spectral sound earlier this year was a statement of intent the former electro house producer was saying goodbye to boys noize and busy p and hello to l i e s trilogy tapes and more straightforward house and techno is the uk-based australians latest offering its as house-focussed as his last effort but shows he still has some way to go before he rubs shoulders with his influences features two cuts both under five minutes long the title track has strains of chillwave and witch house with looped distant vocal snippets and a breezy vibe is the highlight here though its s best effort since switching to subtler sounds and the only one that has any connection to his electro house past classic deep house synth notes make for an engaging analogue-sounding track but there are only about three usable minutes thanks to the beatless one-minute intro djs up for a bit of traktor or cdj looping however have a bomb on their hands
new york label sci-fi fantasy might be best known for issuing a pair of singles from janus artist lotic on the surface of it this ep comes from a different world entirely but theres less distance than you might think between the gorgeous ambience of nycs and the confrontational collage approach explored by lotic his janus crew and connected producers like total freedom the place to start is love obscene a remix of janet jacksons love scene (ooh baby) dedicated to total freedom himself a prolific producer of edits and bootlegs total freedoms edits are garish and upfront often using apocalyptic bell chimes or grisly screams; by contrast floats his source material in a goo of pads but theyre really just contrasting responses to the same environment where total freedom (as with lotics damsel in distress ) articulates the shock induced by the webs cultural bombardment simply dissolves himself in the torrent on that particular remix the dissolution felt partly complete; likewise on s 2013 debut lp where recognisable musical gestures remained like lumps in a semolina pudding this ep slipped out as a free download in november goes all the way the producer has described it as his love song attempt but unlike the janet jacksons of this world it depicts love not as a contract between two people but as a diffuse energy distributed across countless online nodes track titles hint at the consummation of a vague all-encompassing desire while the music itself is transparent and almost-featureless as if conventional love songs have been vaporised and left to swirl like dust clouds needless to say the effect is gorgeous even if like much great ambient music when its all over youre left wondering precisely what it is youve been enjoying

tiger woods are a rather mysterious twosome heres what we know about the production duo: tigers first name is larry and woods is david oh wait come to th k it those given names seem suspiciously fake as well but this we are certa : the pair have been caus g a commotion the slo-mo-boogie and disco-edit worlds as late largely through the strength a series hand-stamped white labels released over the last year or so on the edita ment label then there was that great electr unked remix hundred the hands jangly disco-wave tune commotion and a chugg g totally groovy ra podcast from this past w ter the rather obtuse terview that accompanied that set saw the boys (were assum g theyre male here) claim g that the purpose for their secretiveness was that its so easy to get to know th gs nowadays; for once we tried to keep it spicy like it was back the day fair enough but that cloak anonymity might be lifted soon whether they like it or not as the pairs debut album is com g out on gerd jansons label and it rocks if youve heard that ra podcast or managed to get your hands on any those white labels which feature heavily on the new lp then you know the basic tiger woods template: a steady patient groove paired with carefully chosen smartly arranged samples most those samples are pulled from the disco-boogie universe and share that i-th k-i-know-that-one-but-cant-quite-place-it quality that can be either be frustrat g or dreamy depend g on ones cl ation towards tra spott g a few samples are easy to place thats imag ation on for stance one the albums highlights the song grabs bits and pieces vocals from just an illusion and music and s adds a touch heavenly swirl g keyboards and sits them atop a deliberate groove its the classic slow-builder but when that rubbery just an illusion bassl e kicks its goose-bump time thats basically tiger woods modus operandi a nutshell a s gle-m ded pursuit for that one moment transcendence with no cl ation to get sidetracked along the way not that theres a lack variation the tracks is roller-r k nirvana with gloriously gauzy synths drift g beneath a chunky rhythm section and a loop creamy vocal samples; dr meanwhile fuses a lop g drum beat to electr unk bass and a beautifully hooky synth squiggle some the tracks like the gallop g glitter g manage to break the 120 bpm barrier and a few even feature an actual vocalist though as you would expect from this crew all we know her is that her name is em theyll be fully outted soon with an album this good the backstory cant help but see the light day but even without the anonymity tiger woods will be plenty spicy
have always been the black sheep of an act seemingly at odds with the imprints smooth house aesthetic and while its nice to hear the label testing the waters with different sounds muting the noise was a particularly solid counterpoint to kompakts pop ambient series its hard to understand exactly what dixon and me see in this duo in the context of doesnt offer much in the way of answers: it has a stiff funkiness that doesnt approach the sublime territory of kraftwerk mixing a stolid four-to-the-floor kick to some echoed dub snare and a cascading synth line its eventually joined by two 8 bit riffs but hardly does much else along the way its not house its not techno its not particularly engaging home-listening electronica and it aint good as something somewhere in between all of that either hardly does better making like plone or plaid with its polite melodic breakbeat idm warp did this better and comprehensively so in the mid 90s loco s rework of will be of interest to the djs in the audience he and martin buttrich do their best with the material stretching things out to more than 11 minutes but it suffers from the same problem as the original: floating in place with no semblance of forward momentum it simply marks time waiting for a hook to lift it out of the murk im sure that descending bassline and unmoored synth do it for some jocks but there are far more compelling ways to stand still
given the disparity in sound between his last release in late 2011 and his most recent it feels as though has been hidden away furiously honing his craft where his previous output carried a glossy uk garage sheen this four-tracker owes far more to stormier styles of house and techno nowhere is this more evident than on where bright flashing synths and a heavyweight bassline oppressively combine its rich aesthetic is a strong mission statement for s newfound approach diffuses the intensity laying floaty pads over a wooden framework while under the cover of a serene breakdown that softness becomes punchy robotic stabs lending some bite to the once docile track marks the eps apex its cascading drums feather-light pads and soothing vocals contributing to its gorgeous meditative feel has yet another brooding tuneful bassline that melds with sonorous synths and is wrapped up in s newly fashioned veil of atmospheric maturity
ah the internet has debut releases lined up for glaswegian label as well as london label night slugs yet hes based in montreal but just a few minutes spent with his ecstatic neon-streaked house sound is enough to place him comfortably in the company of these overlapping collectives greenes sound is reasonably straightforward and feels more rooted in house than the grime or bassline influences so cherished by his uk counterparts his songs are propelled forward by steam-powered beats where the kicks determinedly cut through the earth underneath lightly syncopated percussion you can hear it in the blocky thump of plain untreated piano cooly slips and slides on top of the chunky groove his naked love for r b makes up the other half of his sound one that shines through more obviously than any of his peers excepting perhaps the dirty south dubstep of girl unit influence is most explicitly explored in the spiritual twins of and both of which feature prominent pitched-up vocal samples hijacks a barebones ascent of skittering drums and synthetic polyester bass gleefully spinning its cut-up vocal into improvised permutations and configurations breaking down and building up at will it gradually releases tension in concentrated streams of synth which overwhelm without distracting histrionics its more subdued cousin forgoes the bumpy ride for a more linear progression climaxing in a flurry of twinkling arpeggios and topsy-turvy melodies
has been a shining light in the artist roster at german label get physical in the last year or two his releases are constantly on the playlists of big name dj s and it is no surprise to see his success rewarded by the label with his debut artist album the album also features perhaps his biggest hit the irresistible freemind a track which really saw s name magnify around the world funk on you is an early highlight in the album with melodic bleeps riding smoothly over a chunky and downright dirty baseline a guy called jack has a pretty tasty jacking baseline while cal aca bounces throughout with tripped out sequences of warped low end baselines rising is a moody cut that builds delightfully and it again sees unleash a deep and tasty baseline keeping the groove flowing the calling has a pretty retro feel while rave d amour sees the album hit its tripped out peak dark room is a pretty tasty gritty number while the upbeat drums of marching theme lift the mood of the album up a notch the retro vibes return with neon and its booming electro baselines while many will be familiar with the smooth builds and reverbs of freemind what follows is a smooth and uplifting piece in rimini and then glitter another smooth flowing track with a smooth low end and melodic pads class of 1984 concludes the album with great style using downbeat drums a chunky grinding baseline and sweeping effects in terms of variety of styles and pace the album is lacking in some parts but this fault is overlooked due to the quality of each production it is pretty much club orientated with most tracks having a solid beat behind them and if you have heard the quality of before then i think you will be pleased with the 13 tracks he has come up with here

are currently supporting the sugababes on tour they re a poppy electro rock outfit whose look seems a little stuck in 2003 however is a pleasant enough affair kind of like chicks on speed crossed with scissor sisters as a major label act they have the usual clutch of unknown remixers but this really isn t a bad package the van remix is corny hairdresser house but effective with every well-honed electrohouse clich deployed to nicely complement the singer s trashy delivery there are squealing synths and stuttering breakdowns and it s all very maximal the other standout is the bizarre 2 step garage on meth mix by ratcliffe the chopped vocals and rolling bass combined with jiggling beats are a welcome reminder of this sadly defunct genre crossed with cod-minimal bloops and blips t s endearing and for one am hoping it s the start of a revival there are actually seven remixes on the cd promo which seems a bit excessive weirdly enough one of them is by arthur baker (as rtny) t s not bad sticking closer to the rocky sound of the original but you wouldn t know it was done by a musical pioneer
if he hadnt just dropped an r podcast full of it s affection for deep house would have come as a surprise the legendary producers cv in recent years hasnt veered far from dub techno schaffel and ambience s such fehlmanns remixers on the newest ep bearing his name make sense both move and soulphiction are among the most popular german purveyors of the stuff yet come at the genre from two slightly different angles soulphiction per usual teases out the inherent funkiness in revealing how hypnotic a simple guitar lick can be if you dont bother to switch it up (here thats hardly a criticism especially when you have such a cinematic orchestral sample looping in tandem ) move favors the sort of ambience that is in abundance in fehlmanns work smooth undulating synths beats that throb rather than thrust he has both in his two b-side remixes bounces along merrily while weaves melodies around one another meanwhile sees him get deeper itd be the sort of po-faced deep house that producers love to anonymously bash but inserts a mouse on mars-esque fart of a synth line throughout ensuring that the remix does anything but fade into the background
deep chord progressions lackadaisical shuffles snatches of female vocals (just enough for a hook) house musics instant gratification with the cheek of garage and the headiness of dub these were the things hotflush once successfully plundered before techno became its focus those ideas make a welcome return on the retro-futurist debut of liverpool-based artist recalls hotflush circa 2011 around the time dubstep and house music were learning to get along it uses erykah badus n n to muscle into your subconscious and it only burrows deeper with each play familiarity is its strength youll remember the track when the lights go up is a light and limber funky number that flutters on gossamer wings while joins breakbeat and bloopy techno in deliberately off-kilter fashion which puffs of female vocals go some way to smooth out is a beatless primordial thing thats quite lovely despite its skeletal arrangement s mercurial feel-good bass music reminds us of a bygone era of hotflush that thankfully hasnt disappeared completely
hits double figures with a release here from who tries to continue his good form from his frenzeed funk release with the vocal mix is first up and i must say that his form is definitely still pretty good this is a nice track here with acid riffs combining with a smooth analogue baseline and filtered vocals all creating a pretty upbeat production the instrumental mix is unfortunately more of the same so if you disliked the musical elements of the vocal mix then the flip isn t going to help issues much a pretty solid release here from and one that is definitely worth a look
new zealands sam reed debuted last year on samurai with a smattering of tracks showcasing an elegant and ethereal view on drum bass laced with live instrument samples and intricate drum patterns his take on the genre owes a lot to calibre but feels less stuffy and meticulous the two introducing eps are buttressed by a well-timed and well-curated remix single presenting different takes on s sumptuous sounds synkro is first up with he pulls out threads from the originals conventional percussion leaving an insistent but uneven tapping that sounds like morse code at 170 beats per minute the hesitant but heartfelt chord progression is clay in synkros hands who drowns it in sighing washes of beautiful synth and a perfectly careful bassline that grounds rather than drives it synkro is a producer whose work toes the line between the breathtaking and tooth-achingly saccharine but his remix is one of the strongest and most effortless of his career the other side is taken up by another drum bass underdog who has since moved on to weirder climes exit signee consequence takes the chirpy and wraps its tinny arpeggios around a distorted and glitchy beat an ironed out version of his idm-addled work on last album test dream its a less distinctive but no less enjoyable effort and the work here puts a neat finishing stamp on a very promising introduction to one of drum basss brightest new names
labels ethos usually gets easier to grasp once its catalogue gets to a certain size but something about remains elusive its eps are stoic and self-contained full of powerful tracks that resist explosive moments s an offshoot of a label whose founders came up with dubstep and evolved from there its easy to trace s roots ut the music itself experimental techno heavy on tonal contrasts uk-derived polyrhythms and totemic bass isnt as easy to pin down ristol-based producer stamps with plenty of hallmarks but his own voice doesnt emerge as clearly forceful finger drumming used in place of a snare gives a crisp focal point its surrounding elements are more ordinary sustained bells and spinning glass introduced serially at various pitches eventually merge as a needle-thin medley in a track as cavernous and ripe with possibility as the restraint feels misguided is bolder once the bass pulses through it the phased vocal snippets that open the track begin to smother what follows its intense through headphones so expect it to feel even more powerful on a dance floor
s fitting that coinciding with the current trend for all things deep matty heilbronn one time francois k sparring partner at body and soul makes a return (of sorts) on steve bugs imperious this is the second release on poker flat white (which sounds like a low-carb version of the real thing) an offshoot which i can only guess seems to be pointing poker flat in a more unadulterated housey direction is an atmospheric knees-up that rises and falls in all the right places is a great mixing track achieving multiple climaxes along the way and keeping things interesting with a synth stabbing laid over the top of the driving bass this along with the twisted voice samples create a claustraphobic environment that joseph conrad would have been proud of does likewise but lets be honest: these two tracks were recorded at the same session with only slightly tweaks giving them their respective identities is the moodier of the two and also the more stripped down hes been here before has matty notably with arriba abajo on wave music a few years back new york air must have something in it that makes you want to dream of exploring far away places in mysterious circumstances personally i blame king kong and cab calloway but theres a trend for this which is starting to emerge solomuns river cruise being another current example matty pulls it off here but i would have been happier with a little more variety
not too much is known about outside of germany though he has djed with marcel dettmann for years and is a resident at erghain quite a lot on the other hand is known about the erlin label ostgut-ton which even after just eight releases has become synonymous with quality techno music this the ninth release is certainly not for the faint hearted as fengler takes the label back to its roots with two icey blasts of panic laden techno first up is a track that may have some of you reaching for a xanax as a two note intro builds suspense before the track explodes into life fenglers sound here is quite bass heavy and almost dubby but dont let that fool you this is frenetic and pitch black peaktime techno as youd expect from the musical wing of the famous erlin nightclub erghain on the flipside is just a sliver less aggressive but dont expect to take a breather once again the intense and doom-laden atmosphere is pervasive as slightly trippier effects combine with metallic percussion and deep sub-bass to create another fine piece of floor shaking techno ostgut-ton remains bang on point with this release just dont call it minimal
- has in the past displayed the boldest pop sensibility of any of the night slugs crew but perhaps burned by the mainstream flirtations of his ill-fated 2011 p neon dreams lately james connolly seems to be indulging his darker side his contribution to night slugs club construction series released last year was about as un-pop as you could imagine him getting its ultra-functionalist drum machine workouts all jagged hi-hats and maddening one-note synth lines owed a clear debt to both early chicago jack tracks and ghetto house but galloped with a ruffneck sense of propulsion borrowed from the uks dance floors given the feel of that ep its gratifying if not all that surprising to see connolly turn up on clones jack for daze sub-label the ep is more stylistically expansive than its predecessor if frustratingly quite a bit less thrilling is more measured than its forebears and reintroduces a welcome bit of melodic flair into the formula its bassline is eminently hummable while pristine melodies hint at connollys dayglo past brings the ghetto house bounce although its set in a surprisingly pensive context and trak are more skeletal: grinding percussive workouts with a stop-start approach to pacing its tempting to draw comparisons with a jack for daze masterpiece like geeemans rubberband2 but for the most part these tracks while perfectly fit for purpose are altogether less dynamic and less imaginative than their peers
cold storage a late-70s and early-80s studio in a former brixton meat pie factory is one of the strongest arguments for enos concept of scenius or communal genius started by nonprofit cme housing ssociation it was offered affordable studio space to artists the raincoats the pop group and even robert wyatt worked out of the space the most singular group to emerge from cold storage was this heat that band comprising charles hayward charles bullen and non-musician gareth williams modeled their refurbished freezer space as well as their methods after cans inner space studios rehearsing and recording for eight hours daily to come up with a new kind of post-punk s john peel put it to my knowledge there is no other music like this heat the band imploded following the release of their lurching art-punk masterpiece 1981s deceit a terse effort that captured the cold war climate of fear imperialism and nuclear brinksmanship things had only gotten worse by the time charles bullen recorded the sole album as margaret thatchers conservative party dominated following the falklands war nd the guitarists approach had changed considerably: instead of wallowing in paranoia he dropped out is a document of blissed-out escapism that mixes dub reggae and koanic lyrics with the ecstatic guitar squalls of this heat while this heat was driven by gareth williams oblique strategies using the studio as an instrument and practicing countless hours was about bullen finding his groove t the time he was lost in the caribbean and world music wafting through brixton market he found his sole collaborator julius cornelius samuel ( k dub judah ) while buying a clarinet in a junk shop lucky coincidence as the soft-handed percussionist provides a perfect counterpart to bullens riddims s best songs like dub music at the peak of its powers have the ability to loosen the body and mind within seconds take the opening title track: an organ plays resolutely while bullen runs up and down the fretboard and samuels opening volleys are thrown down an echo chamber following a heavy reggae dirge the guitar soars again threatening to bust through the cold storage ceiling bullens lyrics are ephemeral mainly consisting of do unto others -type fare taken as a whole they act as mantras positive affirmations of brotherhood in a world increasingly defined by conflict the holistic approach to musical traditions also bears out a hippie-ish worldview places a wild middle eastern-tinged clarinet over a greek bouzouki strummed with raga-like intensity laying the path for globetrotting psychedelic punks like sun city girls like the congos open up the gate closing track begins with a warm melodic section thats dropped quickly bullen would abandon after due to a complete lack of [public] interest but the next three decades saw the album become a holy grail for fans of weird inventive and life-affirming music a remarkable feat for an obscure one-off project in the liner notes of s reissue bullen recalls how on the days he recorded hed ride his bike past a foreboding mural featuring a warhead and a grim reaper wrapped in uk us and ussr flags three decades later that sort of imminent doom lingers and thankfully retains its transportive magic
s latest ep for who number jay tripwire and marc ashken as clan members is jampacked with wobbly grooves intriguing tempo changes and bundles of bass s atmospheric techno bubbles and pops vocals starting half speed then spiralling up to chipmunk levels picks up the pace; trippy vocals drift in and out before brutal synth stabs rip their way in smoothes the waters with its warm detroit synth swells crackling vinyl glitches passages of wonky melody and crunchy drums quirky but the right side of it guest remixers get their teeth into two tracks with get the curse boss clement sending back to the 80s with an idiosyncratic electro house rerub fx that sound like a cat having its tummy tickled do battle with spanking 808 handclaps and clipped vocal edits finally shenoda takes into deep but dark spacey house territory with a locked groove that builds to a crackling crescendo
in december 2009 tensnake played early in his r set it was the fourth track and he used it to shift things up a gear the two-halved character of the song allowed him to do it and its for me what makes so special the track wanders and seems to naturally hit upon an elevated ecstatic state in its second half (it also helps that its an on-point revamp of what was a great tune in the first place imaginations music and lights ) t first i didnt realize the duo took pretty much everything here from that song and a little bit from just an illusion its a re-edit but a creative one and the fact that it makes so much funky jubilant sense is pretty impressive doesnt lift off or wander so widely thats not a criticism if it aint broke dont fix it as they say and its got all the blatant positivity of the -side claritys the way you make me feel is the raw material this time its got bigger drums (including a smashing 80s snare in both senses of the word) and a different flow that catches a groove and rolls the two tracks each stand alone meaning that it all adds up to a very round package and one that if you missed it the first time should surely be near the top of every lowtempo disco/house fans shopping list

is a label thats easy to like the berlin-based imprint run by mano le tough the and baikal is a hub for melodic house that sounds effortless while betraying an uncommon sort of craftsmanship the labels sixth release and s first on the label keeps close to this aesthetic makes an immediate impression with a sweet melodic refrain and crisp percussion and about 90 seconds in theres the sort of dramatic lead line that ten walls has recently mastered this swaggering sound which gets sharper as the track gathers momentum is at first reminiscent of walking with elephants but its grandiose air eventually pulls it closer to gotham the s remix of keeps the originals emotive riff but it speeds things up with the aid of toms and woodblocks the chords dissolve into the tracks airy fabric and though the overall contours are a little foggier than those of its predecessor its distinctive melody makes it just as strong
next up on greek based comes a release from highly rated a producer that has been heavily related with the silver planet stable 3 tracks feature on this ep but do they deliver the usual standards that ben has been associated with first up is driven (yes you everyone) an interesting production to say the least the track flows nicely with some intense percussive elements a creepy baseline and eerie sounds and effects a dirty baseline gathers in intensity deep into the track and it really gives it a gritty edge dented (bc s re-edit) follows this and the beats get slightly more conventional a nice subtle piano line gives the track a little funk and the baseline that accompanies the track really gives it a good foundation and go forward a very nice production that maintains a smooth flow dented (degrees of freedom remix) is up last and it provides the deepest track of the release deep rumbling baselines build the track alongside some eerie effects and crisp drum patterns although it flows quite smoothly the track somewhat lacks a certain factor that makes it memorable on the whole this is quite a solid release that has 3 pretty varied tracks that are all quite solid worth a look

was one of the more sober cuts from dring n zes most recent and most inebriated full-length on get physical its rasping electro bassline does hint at unhinged madness from start to finish but instead of spraying far and wide its kept in check by marching drums and constant perc and is sweetened by a finger plucked spanish guitar sad oboe (or something) and heavy hearted keys said orchestral leanings frankly make it the perfect bait for a remix by the brandt ensemble who replace the long and languid groove with intricate micro-evolving rhythms dance floor potential not great but jazz infused home-listening head-fuck highs very likely away from those disney animated instrumentals of bbf smash serves up a much more fulsome remix that pairs rigid machine noises with rubberised kicks for something that builds and maintains tension for seven minutes
justus k hncke is the kind of free spirit who frustrates even his own fans the mainstay has consistently split opinion with his vocal style his feather-light disco tracks and the mischievous nature of his left-field house justus k hncke the his first album in five years will likely be just as divisive k hncke is a serious musician but he has little time for accepted notions of good taste humour is key to his work consider the artwork here which shows him dressed as a one-man techno band or the albums closing track a dire syrupy electro-pop cover of the ations to really enjoy k hncke you have to accept that his ouptut is patchy here for instance one must tolerate the self-indulgent (a tribute-cum-imitation of 70s easy listening) to get to the fantastic a bumpy 808 acid track counter-intuitively laced with a gorgeous melody s ever though when k hncke hits his mark hes great with his dulcet voice brought to the fore and selbstgespr ch see him injecting his polished disco with a little electro-pop muscle the former echoes hot chips tightly wound funk while the latter is a more retro affair shot through with monumental synth stabs that recall pet shop boys k hncke seems to have quietly beefed up his sound all around take a track featuring eric d clark (k hnckes old whirlpool productions partner) whose cashmere soft keys are offset by a blubbery bassline and punchy drums ll have to cherry-pick the best moments from but thats justus k hncke he may bemuse you but you can never write him off
following claudio prcs hypnotizing modersk rlek ep the next release for is a four-track release from its another fine effort for the eindhoven artist who has a knack for churning out minimalist mid-tempo techno and its made even better by some diverse synth work the two 4/4 cuts are particularly strong anchored by a throbbing offbeat bassline pushes through clouds of reverb while edgy vaguely orchestral synths descend into the mix with its subtle high-pitched stirrings maintains the tense mood at first but then van abbe drapes the whole thing in smooth warm chords this beguiling juxtaposition makes it the eps highlight the most upbeat track here packs dense heavily swung percussion and distorted chords but its not quite as dynamic as the previous two as usual with van abbe an ambient cut completes the pack tracks the slow mournful disintegration of what sounds like processed cello loops the organic approach is more remarkable than your average techno eps ambient sketch but youd be forgiven if you end up stuck on and as its those two where van abbe really shines

its not surprising that s music found its way into regiss dj sets including his blackest ever black mixtape boys are here s riffs on the sparse stepping style explored by the downwards boss a few years back before sandwell district disintegrated and post-punk took over drums are crisp and meticulously arranged in loping broken-beat rhythms the sound design cavernous and the mood elegantly gothic (modern cathedrals the name of s label and party in his detroit hometown describes it nicely ) goth streak extends to the titles just recently he was experiencing gentle difference this ep for a sub-label of terdimensional transmissions finds him this disaffected pose doesnt always lead to compelling music title track is neatly put together but its careful accretions of field recordings scuzzy drones and flecks of downpitched voice lack a certain spark finds more striking contrasts elsewhere bouncing percussion gives more urgency while bright synth stabs work as a counterbalance to the abyssal dub chords weighing down the end of each bar on uncanny pristine rave chords ping-pong around the sombre space like flashes of light in the churchly gloom

globalization might have brought a lot of evil into this world advancing neo-liberal economics making mcdonalds the new folk food everywhere putting kids into sweatshops but one good thing that can be said about it is that it has globalized culture thanks also to the internet kids in canada can now act just like kids in france and canadian duo made up of ex-members of death from above 1979 (rip) not only sound inspired by french house theyve rightfully earned their position in the subgenre can be placed on the map as the missing link between french electronica star alex gopher and canadian gender chameleon and electro wonderboy tiga this is true musical pastiche in : daft punk fans becoming daft punk for a different continent but as release their much anticipated debut album their global masterplan has a fatal flaw: their shallow track concepts will kill any dancefloor listening to the reveals a sad truth: fans are still after all fans fans can produce outstanding remixes (my personal favorite from is their rerub of metric s monster hospital) but riding on the biggest wave of hype canada has known for a while beating out all contenders that cross the border they still remain merely that: fans but it s not like they are completely devoid of aesthetics the single easy love sports cowbells and happy keyboard punches below funky robotic vocals to great effect while paris is another excellent arrangement (this one seems both a titular and musical tribute to their brothers in arms parisians justice ) elsewhere work on you is another likeable cut ripping the same treats easy love had with slightly different presentation but the cut with enough of the right groove to carry a real dance track is : its got a simple but addictive hook and a repetitive mantra-like chant that ll probably guarantee it s the only track here remembered in a few years on the other hand in their own personal space are having loads of fun theyre great djs (djs need enough technical knowledge to get by but they greatly benefit from an honest passion for making people freak out) good remixers and are well-respected both at home and abroad but if youre looking for independently inspired creativeness dont bother with if you still insist community revolution in progress on the b-side to work on you has a bag full of much more interesting ideas and tighter production values than anything on which should lead us to this conclusion: dont completely dismiss just yet keep one eye open for them
one of the most anticipated albums of is undeniably dub edits and whiskey-coke from swiss producer francois loz has been putting out some mighty impressive productions for half a decade since we were first introduced to his work in 2000 with get my love it wasn t really until his fantastic tunneling was heard on anthony pappa s nubreed album that we got a true taste of the talents that lied within s work and from that point on he has consistently delivered the goods on a demanding market many tracks on and many successful compilation appearances later we now arrive to his debut artist album on the saw imprint and what a quality album it is the opening track you me is superb full of raw emotion and atmosphere thanks to some quirky melodies and beautiful string patterns the album smoothly transitions (keep in mind the album is mixed) into one of his recent hits closer to me a smooth journey of vocal house thanks to the retro like vocals of jd davis sunrise keeps the fantastic flow and energy with some swirling synths melodies and some nice subtle but driving baselines monster is a cheeky fusion of electro stabs and quirky vocals thanks to jd davis while lover is a somewhat cinematic piece again using lots of emotive elements five is a little chunkier with a smooth baseline meeting subtle acid riffs and a quirky vocal hook while many will appreciate the smooth baselines and cute melody of my memory part 2 of my memory follows and it is a little more gritty then its predecessor with stronger beats and some summer pads us them is straight up class thanks to some intense acid hooks electro riffs and a general collection of intense sounds and effects the album comes to a close with the very retro sounds of 1987 thanks to some killer stabbing pads what has surprised me about this album is perhaps the change we have seen in s work this album has pretty good variety despite the pretty full on nature of it and it has some great moments in there don t expect many dark moments like his older work but instead expect some pure inspiring moments probably due to the fact that he spent a year in tuscany during the making of this album it is put together really well and it hasn t been poorly mixed let me assure you with sounds from certain productions carrying well into following tracks and the general flow working very well some may be put off by the fact that there aren t many downbeat productions in the album but once you hear what has produced you may not really be that worried
is evan baggs and katsuya sano a duo thats come into focus as sleek minimal deep house makes way for grittier quirkier sounds their first record appeared on cabaret recordings last year as the label was experiencing a similar shift in direction their white label goes further into the meeting of classic drum machines and atonal melodies thats increasingly finding traction in their milieu like the recent work of spacetravel binh and onur zer these tracks sound like the result of hardware-only sessions recorded in real time whether or not this is the case theres a steamy sheen to the musics aesthetic and a feeling of immediacy to the admittedly static structures like you can sense the phantom afterimages of their hands dancing on the controls nother trait share with their contemporaries is a knack for satisfying basslines and a preference for oddball melodies has the latter in the form of a squelching lead line that covers a queasily chromatic set of pitches; the former comes in a soft well-placed tom figure drum machine patterns are regularly changed and subjected to external processing while a doggedly monotone acid line pushes its way to the foreground its appearance could be a highlight for some though it detracts from the many details already present is powered by a rolling low-end that dovetails perfectly with a great combination of rippling synth and what might be a low-bit grainy sample like other top-notch grooves its tough to put your finger on what makes it move so well but it all becomes clear in the dance hopefully more nuggets from baggs and sanos sessions are on the way
when i interviewed londoner earlier this year he claimed that he didnt really like to re-use beat structures or revisit themes and ill be damned if his latest single isnt a radical fulfillment of that promise sounds absolutely nothing like what tom green has done before something about the clattering momentous funk of recalls older jamie vexd and eskmo it sees incorporating a vocalist for the first time as well frequent skream collaborator s heavily filtered chrome-plated vocals mirror owl city in their sickly sweet cadence that is until the rudi zygadlo-esque chorus where the vocals undulate and stretch like taffy once youre done scratching your head through that tunes brief four minutes things return to more familiar territory with flipside its got all the nervously fluttering bits and bobs and high-octane shenanigans only its at a slower tempo more like high speed house or techno (your call) than drum bass the vinyl single consists solely of two remixes first up is neosignal the german drum bass scientists responsible for some of the most exciting drum bass that isnt made by who choose the same halftime shudder as the original something about their heavily compressed thrash turns limp and unpleasant when meted out in stagger rather than speed demon style on the flip techstep tear-out producer metrik brings straightforward drum bass in what might be the worst thing ever released on as every bar is assaulted by obnoxious waves of blaring synth finnish producer teeth steps in for a final remix for the digital package he attempts to contain the originals uneven stomp in a wireflame blotted out by low-end largesse and ends up entirely generic in the process
scratcha s pretty ugly released earlier this year saw the producer nurture his pop side crafting an album of wonked digital soul: beautiful at points but too often flawed the fact is as fine as scratchas weird pop hybrids can be its in his more stripped-back efforts that the real shock value tends to lie the stumbling gurning natty over its fatima-featuring pop reincarnation just vybe for example the ep sees the producer return to more unambiguously dance floor fare and the results four brash house hybrids that look well beyond uk funky for inspiration are a pleasure to behold the title track is breezy at the opening chopped up rhodes samples vying for attention with bursts of nasal synth before long though we sidestep into weirdly upfront territory with a discordant hyped-to-the-nines breakdown presaging a great throbbing wall of subbass peppered with stuttering edits s typical scratcha: a gleefully jarring contrast between sweet and screwface-sour which shouldnt work but undoubtedly does meanwhile is a stormer from the get-go its pummeling snares and ravey pads barely settling into a routine over its three-and-a-half minute length trades in the mix of crisp house percussion and quietly dissonant background atmospherics that recurs throughout this ep; its initial furtiveness though gives way to a prim yet meaty thud over which rat-ta-tat snare syncopations do their thing finally uk funky is referenced more overtly in its infectious kick-clap shuffle playing host to a louche woozy melody in the breakdown the digipack additions dont add much to proceedings feels strangely devoid of energy; s tremulous vocal sits uneasily over the explosive rumours ; french supplies a neat but unremarkable 2-step reworking of but they dont need to is a storming four-tracker transfiguring the concerns of the current underground as only can
one of early s calendar-markers for many in the r community rapha l s but full-length seems like its oh about two years overdue by now fter all the swiss producer has spent four years forging his own brand of swooning immersive techno and ep house whether with mirko loco as lazy fat people or solo on kinship labels like connaisseur rekids and liebe* tail as well as his own perspectiv imprint whether crafting within more refined house templates like slipstream for sous or slightly brawnier tropes like on connaisseurs zugunruhe s tracks tend center around the intricacy of their melodies and his sense of patient rhythmic ascent perhaps it will come as a bit of a surprise for long-time fans then that for his much-awaited but album snapped up by joris voorn for his and edwin oosterwals label settles in arguably his most soft-focus moodpiece house date ts a lush relatively organic work that induces a kind of chamomile vibe both its greatest asset and its biggest weakness japanese for gar n fittingly exu s first and foremost patience and contemplation focuses on the records breathing points rounding out longer pieces with brief respites like the snipped vocal nepiece of and the slow bell chimes of nterlu i d by christine s jazz-cellar vocals t sets the records mellow vibe early a slow stroll a p warbling nes and synthetic strings cut reveals how enamored sounds with space and live-sounding looseness; much of is more notable for what it lacks in sonic nsity than for the way it entwines its elements: theres sufficient room for both the listener and the producer float in its gaps to offset some of this drifting is a welcome moment thats a bit more termined tumbling handclap rhythms sift in another of s resonant bell-chimes a rare moment of growth and rising heartrate while almost surges as well splices of guitar and a ne-pattern melody seeming forward-press in a way that recalls past glories like big city but these moments are o sparse sturdy against its often listless serenity for all of their surface warmth tracks like the child-vocal looped the dawnbreak-synth stretch and the vapid if expertly-titled sound almost affectless ir thin attempts envelope and cushion are un rmined by a lack of sonic cohesion almost as though theyre unspooling before theyve even been sewn in anything uchable while such missteps certainly arent sufficient write off they leave the listener feeling oddly restless after sixty-eight minutes of s licacy spaciousness that bor rs o often on emptiness
back in 2009 volume two of s compilation series began with martyns yet one of the most convincing examples of that years fertile dubstep/techno crossover three years later and the third volume starts with a track from the london duo who probably couldnt be closer to what might be considered dubstep traditionalism these days thankfully its a stunner a sexy slow burner that grinds at a glacial halftime sway with lfos that sound more sensual than visceral makes for a surprising move for a label thats been mostly moving away from dubstep but it reflects label head s unique bass music purview tectonic plates number three is absolutely loaded with dubstep sometimes its the familiar brand of the stuff like s own blackened contribution out the or fellow bristol producer s but hes also got people like making utterly strange 140 bpm music here s s is a definite highlight mixing his intricately dusty breakbeats and recent penchant for piano lines with good ol lurch and ominous chords sounding dark yet euphoric all at once is another unexpected star: the way his hand percussion spills out at the end of each bar is a thrilling little trick like uk funky nailed down in painful contortions all supported by the discs heaviest blasts of sub bass just as weve seen in recent efforts from producers like theres plenty of room left to experiment within a more comfortable dubstep template as well japanese producer appears here with an ultra dubby track where every element is in a constant state of shudder while makes a prominent tectonic debut with a dubstep banger melded out of ironed out junglisms but if has shown us anything particularly with his recent fabriclive mix its that hes not afraid to colour outside of the lines: following slice o dubstep is the skeletal hyper funk of s and the latter end of the album features music too mutant to fit in any genre boxes turning the growling lfos of distance inside out om s violently mangles and filters a typical dubstep midrange bassline to alien resonance and makes a lopsided house track that renders melancholia into accidental grandiosity through its broken flurry of string samples and inhuman singing fter the triumvirate of oddity that almost closes out the album were left with s ten minutes of slow burning broken techno that never quite takes off in its technoid lope it sounds like something that might have been on volume 2 and so in a weird way we end where we were three years ago isnt trying to show off the future of dubstep nor is it trying to cling to some desperately purist view of the genre what it does is show us whats going on right now in the world of bass music: some of its exciting and experimental some of it weve heard before and some of its just kind of boring (sorry ) whats most remarkable here is how everything sounds so comfortable in one place: if nothing else makes for a solid listen unlike so many other label compilations

label manager of makes his debut on his label with this quality release by the name of armed with an original mix as well as a reworking from lee neilson this release looks set to be another quality outing for the label the original cherry pie mix is a big tune suited to a james zabiela set in particular the production begins with a moody intro before some nice chunky beats accompanied by some atmospheric hums get the track into gear once the massive haunting baseline kicks in however it is clear to see which direction this chunky piece of music is heading quirky electronic effects come in mid way into the track to enhance the gritty feel this track has all in all it s not for the faint hearted that s for sure the lee neilson special agent mix is a little smoother and less dirty then the a-side nice warm pads float in and out of the productions as the track flows smoothly for the most part until it hits a nice breakdown midway in that sees some smooth piano type synths give the track a nice melodic touch the nice atmospheric elements remain from the original giving this remix the nice aura the original had a quality release from an ever impressive label be sure to tap into the sounds of this label as you might be heavily impressed
the latest five track sampler from uk based cside trax represents new sounds in the realm of abstract lyricism and quirky beats cside themselves have found favour with the likes of ninjatune artists fink mr scruff and dance music heavyweight andy weatherall the features 5 new tunes from afrophysics genocide ii the slumberjack muaddib and the popeye dolls afrophysics - voodooman (average white boy mix) average white boys mix of voodooman takes a country guitar riff and chops it up to create a weird and quirky effect backed up with heavily syncopated drum breaks featuring plentiful use of stabby pads and rimshots a female vocalist delivers spoken word lyrics taking the listener to a dark and mirky world calling out for the voodooman towards the end a funky slap bass lick takes over giving the tune some bottem end grunt genocide ii - imperial flow uk hip hoppers genocide ii take a futuristic alienoid beat with out-of-this-world tech samples and wobbly alien bass and deliver their english flows that take the listener to another dimension the slumberjack - ladby ladby goes on a futuristic electro tip with elements of booty bass thrown in and yet sounds quite retro as elements of 80s electronic music come to mind arrpegio melodies mingle with off key synth lines and militant drum beats to produce a highly quirky tune muaddib - isaac rublev muaddib provides the ep with more electro this time on a much dirtier and darker tip with a rolling bassline and technoid synth lines all held together with stabby drum beats - and thats just the intro drum breaks reminiscent of old skool hardcore kick in to give the tune a little more oomph and they feature toward the end in a massive breakdown the popeye dolls - bonus track bonus track earns its name from the vocal samples lifted from what sounds like 1930s jazz music and tv shows which are then chopped up frantically in an aphex twin/squarepusher stylee while a manic drumnbass tempo break brings out the beat definitely not reserved for bonus track material as the name implies - those who appreciate quirky musical production styles will appreciate this
s debut 12-inch on dj slyngshots is replete with the sounds of a broad record collection s samples and instruments evoke hip-hop soul and sub-saharan funk but its basically house furnished with 90s boom-bap drums where past tracks all by dj slyngshot could be anthemic ( a x i s ) or idiosyncratic (the rusted jazz of cycles ) these tracks sink deep into stoned grooves driven downwards by gooey hand drums and grainy layers of melody that sounds so at ease with itself is on and a strength s shakers and hi-hats are crunchy foils for thumb pianos chimes rhodes keys and jumpy synth stabs which are neatly arranged across punchy drum grids s medley of drum sounds billowing synths and rubbery tones tumble in frictionless rolls of chugging rhythm however busy the polyrhythms get the eps sticky textures induce a tranquilising haze s drums pump rather than dribble but the sedated mood persists over a dj premier-style loop of plucked guitar and arcing strings a wind instrument or someone blowing through a plastic tube provides a rough harmony but not the adrenaline shot the track needs
for once the pr blurb has got it right: this comeback single by juan atkins is truly an event there are thousands of electronic music releases every week yet stands tall and proud and thats before weve even considered the music itself whats the reason for such reverence well without atkins its perfectly reasonable to posit that ra might not exist that techno music would claim as its birthplace not detroit but possibly a european capital and that on a cultural level the world would be a far poorer place despite this the arrival of also brings with it a sense of trepidation: although he has turned into the live techno experience he always dreamed of atkins hasnt released anything notable for over ten years thankfully he shows flashes of his brilliance on the intro features moody synths accompanying an android vocal which includes a neat reference to alleys of your mind before one of atkinss robust electro basslines kicks in this time however the bass is grainier and bleaker and in places theres almost an industrial feel admittedly its not clear or alleys but for a producer who has been out of the game for so long its a respectable comeback release and is far superior to anything that atkinss other elleville colleagues kevin saunderson and derrick may are doing the stripped back rhythm of mad s remix of is powered by the same kind of heavy doubled up 808s that prevailed on no ufos anks messes with the bass weaving some of his distinctive jazzy nuances into its grainy texture finally atkins seeks to revisit the deep techno of infiniti on like this part of his back catalogue a busy intricate rhythm provides the shuffling basis for the track and the dreamy spacey chords are unlike anything youll hear in contemporary techno but unfortunately these elements dont quite gel together despite this hiccup the fact that atkins has made a comeback and after 30 years still sounds relevant are enough reasons to covet this event
marcus kayes golf obsession shows no signs of receding hes already adopted the name of a legendary player for his 4/4 productions and now the theme continues with the title of his new label key signifiers of kayes output both as marcus intalex and come home to roost on cosy pads delicate melodies and deliciously thick basslines choppy percussion springy dopplereffekt sonics and raw kicks on the opener serve as a taster for the rest of the ep on clouds of pillowy synths tumble through the track offset by a simple analogue phrase and elephantine bass keys straight from the slam school of techno we always knew kaye could do lush and deep but shows he can do twisted too res nothing complex about it its just a jacking slice of heavily distorted techno track is only a brief sojourn though as kaye heads back to a gauzy comforting place on it rattles along at a terrific pace hi-hats hissing like a nest of vipers but its church organ-like melodies lend it gravitas and elegance it may have started out as a sideline but kaye has made one of the most successful transitions from drum bass to 4/4 move since photek
when the first record hit the scene roughly a year ago it sent vibrations running through the techno community the mysterious two track ep that appeared on the shelves of hardwax quickly found its way in to the bags of prominent djs and subsequently became one of the hot must-have items of last year appearing on charts the world over ut the mystery remained: who was the producer behind the two-tracker shortly after sheds solo album came out on ostgut though people began to put the pieces together and the unknown production finally had a face to put to the name starts off almost exactly where youd imagine following the -side of the first ep comfortably its shot through with a dubstep-infused diving bassline that just begs to be worked out on the largest and most robust of systems lthough it retains its signature aesthetic grime distortion the downside is that there is virtually no variation throughout dont assume thats a bad thing though s much of a tool as it is a dance floor monster it begs to be worked and layered capable of lighting even the most reserved of djs sets to a crescendo of epic proportions the flip however is where sheds brilliance is revealed if there were a club sandwiched between erghain and panorama ar that combined their two sounds and styles perfectly this would be its anthem equal parts chicago deep house and sublime dub techno it shines where almost all releases trying to emulate the past fall flat the bouncing sub-bassline brilliant string wash and simplistic piano stabs make this a perfect track for a sunrise leaving us with the hope that a third installment will be coming next year picking up where this one has left us
its fair to say that last years kill your darlings wasnt the record everyone hoped would make so heres a chance to redress the balance with a guest turn on s excellent series just the 24 tracks then - pretty good value with names such as the herbaliser aim and tranquility bass included as youd expect its mostly a laid back collection of slow burning hip hop not always holding the attention but filling the after hours slot with ease after the opening credits from gabor szabo its well worth listening to the confrontational vocals of religion 1 from public image ltd the chilled out splendour of tommy hools barcelone the string led fall break from the ever excellent aim and heavy manners take on the underwolves track so blue its black a note too for the gurgling bass sound opening kraze 1 aniis le neves lilly hall and the feel good track of the mix in street preacher - all chirpy brass chords from the troublemakers s own paralysed has strong elements of serge gainsbourg and might be a bit cheesy for some listeners but the inclusion of patrick moore reading nick walkers peepshow is a great idea - perfect accompaniment for the sky at night if you get my drift
matthew dear is nothing if not a man of many talents he traffics in lush electro-pop under his birthname he crafts saw-toothed bangers as udion while as he strips back the acidic four-on-the-floor bombast of udion to reveal an undulating skeleton of surgically precise techno a outr sound that befits its home on that bastion of all things minimal: minus oth of these tracks have been caned by hawtin and both are featured also on the longplayer released this month -side is built over a devastating rhythm that steamrolls everything it its path reverb-flecked chords create a palpable sense of tension the rinsed snares snap the rhythm to attention but that s before dear throws a serious curveball into the mix by coating zips of raw synth drones on top of it all it s a chaotic effect to be sure but used properly this track is capable of grabbing the room by its neck and pulling it physically into the peak hours of the night the flip is more subdued with dear hollowing out the beat and dousing the mix in oceanic echo with crisp percussion and cycling lawrence-esque piano figures that flit about the stereofield the track is more concerned with being hypnotic and involving than it is with melting the listener s face nd that s the brilliance of matthew dear: he knows when to take it easy on you as well as when to pull out all the stops wonderful twelve from a producer who only seems to get better with age
theres something distinctly poetic about the fact that just as it prepares to shut its doors irreverent new york record store dope should have potentially finally met its match fter a vitriolic takedown of jus- in a round-up of their least favourite records of 2012 the boss hit back with a two-part response: a youtube clip and true to the ig pples hip-hop roots the obligatory diss tracks the ep which consists of a detox and techno fuck mix of the same track is more a vocalised attack than a dance floor record on the former lays down a simple bed of kicks snares and throbbing synths so as not to detract from his brazen fun-poking at the stores cheap wizard of oz d cor its questionable approach to licensing and the owners white lines consumption while the techno fuck mix with its tougher choppier framework may have slightly more musical appeal its still hard to think of a time or a place when youd ever play these records
tief at corsica studios has quietly become one of londons best nights in its first foray as a label it hands a debut to the duo of harry benson and john malcolm moore has twinkling arps and muffled keys that flicker with a steel drum-like resonance with guttural bass synths providing contrast its impressively three-dimensional with perceptible light and shade arttus remix is hewn from tougher material with blobs of acid snatches of vocal samples and a distorted bassline pushed upfront is more plaintive with detroit-y melodies chattering percussion and a purring analogue sound reminiscent of boards of canada in contrast juju s mix sits somewhere between deep house and minimalist techno seeping out over six minutes of ambient tics pillowy electric piano and urgent hi-hats its an ep of wonderfully melodic well-rounded music especially for a debut release
s first release for jimmy s label was an ebm-indebted techno three-tracker that went straight for jugular this remix package is spacier and more relaxed and succeeds on that basis original eps closer gets three reworks two of m by detroit producer erika her remix is a suitably deep and eerie workout that replaces originals tough ingredients with gently clacking drums and o rworldly pads her remix has a similar mood with only a subtly driving bass groove and sonar-bleep keys giving it a more forceful feel jimmy s sails closer to original but again dials down its sharp edges with layers of echo and cushioned drums ambivalent uses a similar tonal shift on his remix of he retains only half-submerged fragments of its airhorn synths and melodramatic vocals and places m in downbeat techno surroundings the was original releases (relatively) soft and slow moment dimitri s remix keeps roughly to that script pitching a humming synth with popping drums and echoing vocal snippets if dazes steely ebm inclinations are your thing n you may not enjoy se remixes but fans of deep strung-out techno should find plenty to love
french producer and ahrpe label co-founder specializes in deep hypnotic techno you might compare his stuff to the likes of abdulla rashim or the hypnus crew but its illuminated with a unique sense of vibrance and color on his new double-pack shares seven more variants of the expansive slowly evolving style heard on his monkaunis and lutsin eps these two slabs of transparent wax move between lighter somewhat playful moods and darker fare surges on the one-beat as resonant low-end harmonizes with bright drifting pads the similarly bouncy revels in on-edge drones and a bassline that floods with reverb on the moodier side of things and each rely on a dense percussive drive spearheaded by thrusts of cymbals and hi-hats the eerily tense is the first of three cuts that emphasize three-beat rhythms and its followed by the records distinct highlight whose soft-clattering wooden drums are topped with wispy evocative synths next is the less impressive where s tight interconnection between bass and drums leads to a bogged-down purely functional sound closing the package is a remix of from evigt m rker another techno talent from sweden who has caused a stir in his own low-key way m rkers approach is straightforward and 4/4-focused but no less immersive his chugging interpretation smooths out most of the originals urgency and adds a layer of dewy humidity like much of what offers theres a sense of the mystical thats sure to delight deep techno heads
catz n dogzs pets recordings released the kink and rachel row collaboration follow the step last year and here the three producers take their relationship to the next level with a studio collaboration will blow up clubs and festivals alike this summer with catz n dogzs clever vocal manipulation splattered across kinks scowling kick and bass combo its a simple track thats mostly nothing new but it plays to each producers strengths ad is for the more tech-inclined tastes s the hook struggles to be heard over the tracks boisterous drums wooden knocks clamour above the din to offer some rhythmic thrust
has been here and there ever since we first heard sasha play this beast of a record late in 2003 well now the track is finally getting a release thanks to the lads at who seems to have a mountain of killer productions lined up in the following months for the time being though we focus on the work of chris lake and rowan blades and also the work of the highly regarded australian producer andy page who puts his reworking forward on the flip first up is the much hyped greed is evil mix that has blessed our ears fro the last 6 plus months you know what to expect here gnarling baselines combined with some stuttering beats and some summer melodies that are made for the summer heat building nicely towards an addictive breakdown where the melodies increase and explode into a cavalcade of deep driving low end rumbles and quirky crisp beats the track maintains a smooth and uplifting flow and vibe throughout making it a hard track to dislike on the flip andy page treat us to his broken beat remix the trademark drum patterns of andy s finely tuned work feature here as smooth solid baselines rumble under the quirky up beat drums and the original melodies acid riffs enter the play as the track builds towards a nice breakdown midway where the beats subside and the melodies take a somewhat balearic style shape the beats come grooving back in and they get twisted as only andy page know how to twist solid work and it goes without saying from the highly rated australian despite the fact that this release might be a few months overdue you cannot hide the fact that it is a very solid set of productions you not only get the solid original mix that has been doing the goods for the last 6 months but you get a very original reworking from one of the finest producer s in the business you can t really ask for much more then that
count on to do it their own way the duo of james taylor and david brown follow up their newest full-length some other country by putting out a teaser single two weeks after its release label issues band strife remixers missing deadlines pressing plant issues it hardly matters is one of some other countrys finest moments and remixers are hot commodities virtually guaranteeing that this thing will sell itself the 12 begins with apparat mining well-worn yet still fertile territory those familiar with orchestra of bubbles or even his solo breakthrough walls will know exactly what to expect: the vocals are gleefully chopped matching the strobe stabs of melody all undergirded by his patented breakbeat rhythms its followed by the moody original which has enough space to allow cassy (of panorama bar 01 fame) to relate her sad tale unfettered by much more than a chattering hi-hat and a propulsive bass line frequent collaborator richard steps up on the b-side for a rework he gives a bliss pop sheen making the whole thing sound a bit like ulrich schnauss lurid pop fantasies while cassy finishes the single off by isolating one line of her vocal ( im on my own ) thusly transforming it into the saddest minimal track youll hear all year
has become something of a master of the 12-inch over the past few years with every release he has produced a perfectly encapsulated snapshot of his sound in development; each pairing of tracks obviously sourced from the same aural cloth while still shining a light on a new aspect of stott s inimitable vision his latest ep for manchester s imprint is no different showcasing a producer exploring fresh territory in the often-monochromatic realm of dub techno dominated by the galloping rhythms of the a-side is aimed squarely at the dance floor resonant synth stabs coast atop a tectonic slab of sub-bass as the kick thrusts the track forward looping hypnotically to a close its the title track on the b however that s the real prize here highlight of stott s collaborative podcast with his label mate claro intelecto is among stott s best work to date the pm has been dialed down just a tad allowing stott room to explore the more atmospheric corners of his sound massive drifts of expansive dub chords are heaped atop a laidback skank of a beat as stott focuses his attention on the whip-crack snares that crackle off into the background propping up a sampled organ lifted straight out of kingston the effect is narcotic not unlike wallowing in the murky shadows of an opium den and declaratively places the emphasis on the dub element of dub techno
maya bouldry-morrison has identified as queer since the age of 6 but she didnt come out as trans until a couple years ago this process of self-realization is reflected however subtly in her music as in a recent interview with terre thaemlitz she described her last lp between two selves as a coded queer trans message because i wasnt ready to come out at that point (in addition to its loaded title that album began with a track called who i will become ) her new one going is less coy released on the label arm of honey soundsystem the record contains in bouldry-morrisons words an overtly queer message with the narrative built around it that message is most clear in the photograph on the cover and in titles like or but it also exists in the actual music which gives going a compelling sense of depth and ambiguity certain chill runs through these tracks even at their most party-friendly sometimes its soothing the opener going pt has the coolness of an untouched pillow sometimes its more haunting the tense chords of the ominous lead of drift this tension reflects the albums personal dimension than the needs of a dj or a party going is shaped by the experiences that loomed over bouldry-morrison as she wrote it lp drifts through various shades of house forming the narrative bouldry-morrison mentioned beginning has a cozy party vibe moving from the sleek deep house of to the raucous uk-flavored breaks of and over time a more somber mood takes hold thanks to drift a silky cavernous techno track and going pt a send-off where bouldry-morrison brings in the full orchestra cascading pianos vaporous pads fluttering percussion and so on decision to end on a bittersweet note was more than stylistic this was also right before trump she told thaemlitz so you know it feels like more poignant of an insight into what was about to happen because what the fuck is happening right now political and personal subtext aside going is an inspired album purely on the basis of its production bouldry-morrison has always had a knack for making sounds jell between two selves ngus finlayson writing for pitchfork said that sonic elements dont sit alongside one another so much as pump fluidly in and out of focus something similar happens here whole thing is soft and feathery even at its most hard-hitting its more chaotic moments rushing by like a breeze through your hair disparate textures form dazzling contrasts: icy pianos against electric synths frothy hi-hats over fluid chords simple sounds feel richly expressive from the odd yaps and wails in the albums opening moments to the canned spinbacks that light up re are times when bouldry-morrison could sound a bit less like one of her main influences: thaemlitz whose own style of deep house introspection is maybe too close of a parallel here still going reveals bouldry-morrison to be a mature and gifted producer one capable not only of conjuring up vivid sounds but of using those sounds to express intimate parts of her biography and inner experience something very few house artists are capable of in this sense going is about self-realization in more ways than one

rarely does the name of a record label conjure up such a gratuitous mental image as the new imprint from fabric stalwart craig richards and as it is playfully named launches with s his own mix playing the brazen part of fist and richards far more subdued effort representing the shy retiring finger on the flip treading a similar structural path as i can read your mind s track is heavy on the bass and lavishly coloured with a variety of creaking glimmering percussive elements which successfully and pleasantly drive the track onwards towards the break this is where employs his greatest production strength the skilful evocation of emotion here its a disquieting creeping fear that he induces with a mournfully sinister synth at the midway point enjoyably at odds with the relatively upbeat nature of the rest of the track richards dispenses with the dance floor sensibilities entirely for his contribution and plunges headfirst into the dark murky waters of twisted ambience the vastly pitched-down and warped beats provide a ticking semi-rhythm while a spoken-word vocal by marcel duchamp lectures on the creative acts associated with art the only part truly recognisable from the original is the screeching synth which sounds far less sinister when set amid pulsing blasts of deep white noise as it is here the track progresses into a beautifully simple and heavily reverbed piano section towards the end; like the elusive and never-to-be-reached light at the end of the tunnel in an eraserhead -style nightmare
churches schools and guns opens with a gr flurry of terrifying electronic dissonance called tells you exactly where is currently at for the first seven tracks here the mood is bleak the pace is predominantly slow as the berlin-based italian expresses through techno the themes of alienation implicit in his track titles however for all its sincerity compositional skill for all that tracks like taunt you to try unlock their chilly mystery the first half of luca mortellaros second album feels emotionally locked-in coolly impenetrable where kerridge carries a similar tone of despair with power or dozzy communicates existential angst with romantic gr eur churches schools and guns is dry so bereft of hope or even anger that it becomes a deeply oppressive listen n suddenly in the extraordinary of the album bursts into life rough as s paper but outrageously fun this banger has a brazilian shimmy in its hips its deep elastic bass loop propelling a top-line of evocative ethereal bleeps like tobiass skippy its a perfect ultra-repetitive piece of slowly-blooming techno that lasts for nine minutes but could hold you spellbound for 40 next track is even better: all glacial grace quicksilver percussive arrhythmia it recalls autechre at their most beautiful had those two been released on an ep with (gas meets perc) the deliciously strange (think: a drugged fairground organist being remixed live by aphex twin) we may have had a heartbreaking work of staggering techno genius it is churches schools and guns offers only tantalising flashes of s true range

s monad xxii was exceptional with two shamanic marva tracks being the most compelling one was a synthesised beat-driven complement to the other a meditation of vocals and singing bowls mysticism and middle eastern essences billowed throughout the record resulting in a clubby sound that felt deeply spiritual the theme has been running through from lucys most recent album to the organic drones of his collaboration with rrose avnis latest gracefully continues the tradition religious connotations are intrinsic to the title track ( means book of psalms in hebrew ) rusty metronomic parts clunk through liturgical chanting before a bold beat and handheld percussion bustles in its a bit awkward at first until everything suddenly comes together as moody industrial techno the rest of isnt quite so avant-garde with avnis sound design subverting in more clandestine dance floor-friendly rhythms theres a rogue horn sound in and a treated vocal in that begins a delicate shift from driving propulsive techno to a much stranger sound strings are led by crisp piano notes in the emotive highly melodic is another strong arsenal of non-conventional club productions from avni
everyone s favourite greek producer makes his debut on aussie label eq grey with a very solid two tracker first up is the delightful feed me acid and it is a production that showcases kosmas at his very best interesting enticing and generally very tasty this sweet as sugar production builds with some cute drum patterns as well as some smooth baselines and a smorgasbord of melodic tastes the arrangement is quite special taking a twist and turn throughout great stuff shame is on the flip and its quite a smooth journey with some vocal elements giving it a bit of depth expect the usual twisted melodies as well as some smooth drum patterns and what you have is another pretty solid track from kosmas a very nice release here and one worth definitely checking out just for the very lovely a-side
the yellow album is s time warp back to the mid 80s - back when arthur baker worked with new order to create blue monday and when he worked with afrika bambaataa and the soulsonic force to produce the electro hip hop/miami bass spawning classic planet rock s contribution to electro is more on a chilled techno/house tip (ala chicken lips) rather than chunky breakbeats (ala krafty kuts) however a few tracks such as detroit style show that are willing to embrace more uptempo styles of electro standout tracks include casio rock which shows a bit of cheek using the same rhythm from the sakata commercials; crazy electro music is very retro in its approach using arpeggio melody lines and has a nice build up about it; detroit style tells you to shake your ass in a detroit techno/miami bass style and the whole wide world is a mash up of parliament style samples cut up on a freaky tech beat with stephen hawking like vocodered vocals scattered throughout never heard electro before this album might just be the introduction you need to an old style that seems to be making a slow resurgence nowadays from intelligent trancey style beats to house tempo tracks that would fit well in a felix da housecat set to uptempo miami bass style tunes has it covered

matt edwards may have created a new alias for a new experimental style but the man better known as radio slave still cant seem to escape making snaky twelve-minute grooves is the debut album for edwards newest guise an alias meant to explore the world of collage from found sources and music from around the globe signals the start of a new multimedia project from edwards paired with film screenings and gallery exhibitions; the record released on edwards label is but one piece of the puzzle like any single piece of a whole it sometimes feels incomplete though im not sure visual accompaniment is what it needs the problem with is that its neither as monumental nor as experimental as it thinks it is the album opens in admittedly brave fashion with thirteen minutes of whirring synths and sampled creaks that eventually form a skeleton of a beat but without warning the listener is shoved into fifteen pulsating minutes of memorably released in the form of ame and dixon remixes on innervisions last year as fuse which sounds like your typical radio slave track sketched out in more maximal elements with some exotic samples thrown in it could be a decent club tune if it werent for the gregorian chants operatic vocals or screeches moreover its too clubby to function as a piece of avant garde music bobbing along unassumingly as frightening samples fly by like transparent gimmicks where does it belong then the rest of wrestles with this question and fails to provide a satisfying answer edwards soundscapes are often fascinating: take the patience-testing where the beat is solely made from hesitant hi-hats that are sensually brushed before violently struck this is repeated over and over and over again and then some more thats another issue: theres little to no progression in these songs the closer takes speech samples and field recordings and revels in the ensuing discord but after a few of its sixteen minutes the found handclaps simply start to sound like normal ones and the novelty fades away even the attraction of edwards unique hypnosis seems absent in these tracks the unfortunately brief is the closest edwards comes to fulfilling his ostensible mission slowly building a stilted beat out of a mixture of digital noises and field recordings: its unconventional yet functional striking a balance that the rest of the album repeatedly weighs too heavily in either direction makes for a fascinating listen or two decent techno made out of field recordings is always going to be at least interesting and is perfectly timed for an electronic music world particularly engrossed with the fetishization of the aural documentation of the exotic rarely does edwards justify the pretense surrounding these tracks or the construction of a whole new alias however: if he wants to truly experiment he needs to move away from his typical radio slave material shows that its a task easier said than done
one thing that seems to be fairly consistent amongst producers of late is the lack of an original sounding bassline so often were treated to cookie-cutter renditions of classic tracks or something that clearly was routinely and hastily tapped out via a preset enter of late the brussels producer has kept listeners on their toes with a steady stream of releases on his time 2 express label as well as random appearances on techno middleweights such as lan muzic and komisch those with an ear for quality have kept the producer on their radar for the last few years but its with these latest bursts of productivity especially last years loc on lan muzic with its bouncing sub-bass or the gurgling punctuated warble of the recent komisch release continued care that weve been graced with shots of perfection that very rarely come so frequently might be new on paper but in quality they reign equal amongst some of the largest and most well-known techno brand names of recent vintage easily contending with powerhouses like ostgut ton and sandwell district and smaller yet intimidating brands like frozen border and do not resist the beat hearing van hoesens potential morse tapped the belgian to create an ep and his debut on the imprint is arguably his best work yet kicking things off on the three-tracker is whose hypnotically off-kilter square wave synth work sets the pace proving that the bizarre is more often the most effective by coupling the aforementioned synth with a powerful kick listeners and djs alike are treated to a late night dervish sure to spin the room around with its dubby chord stabs and funky undertone will most likely remain the hidden gem being brushed aside by the overwhelming power of with a heavy heady bassline that feels liquid in form the tune is a nod to technos undulating despondent past and an undeniable glance at its future spacey and mercurial this is one release that oozes techno perfection one globular bassline at a time

2006 was the year that dubstep finally broke and s eponymous debut rightly rode the crest of the wave now the reclusive south london producer returns with his follow up album which lays another strong claim to being the most innovative and expressive artist not only in dubstep but in the whole of electronic music works the same template as built around ghostly spoken samples two-step shuffles and downbeat ambient interludes it s not a huge step forward sonically then but it s definitely more luxurious: the pace is slightly sped up while the percussive snares and rattles ring out with greater force and clarity gone are the pirate radio crackles and hisses and in their place is a smoother more beautiful ambience s new trick however is his treatment of vocals the drowning voices of his debut are rescued and brought to the fore indeed the verging-on-beatless middle section relies almost solely on vocals and swooning sad ambient waves to cast its spell label boss kode 9 has described this vocal sound as weird soul while himself in one of his rare interviews has described them as angelic and haunting hence the supernatural titles like and but if these are ghosts they re androgynous ones: male voices speed up and female voices slow down to change gender mid-word most strikingly on or on the title track where the voices tremble with elvis-like anxiety the effect however is less about gender-bending than a memory: these are the ghosts of the real sped up vocals of the first hardcore generation the closing track in particular longs for that lost era much more convincingly and wistfully than any nme sponsored revival the only criticism i can make is that is somewhat homogenous in emotional range possibly this is a product of its scope: where s debut was personal and local evoking a cloistered sound world of rainy and worn down south london boroughs and night buses feels more national a wider world of giant road networks industrial cables and cloudy flight paths many of the vocal samples are deliberately made in the this time not in the usa as on one track here is even bluntly named to prove the point it s a wider canvas sure but it s slightly less intimate and emotional too even if the sense of beautiful sadness is still profound is therefore a new kind of folk music for britain and beyond and like the british weather it s all about hoping to catch the moments between the grey clouds not expecting an unending run of sun when you listen you can really feel it on your skin even if it passes in a moment
if you stick around long enough youll eventually see something new and is certainly unusual if not unique sub-label set up by frozen order itself an anonymous hand-stamped techno label and part of a growing group of similarly inclined imprints including wax equalized ncient methods and seldom felt s remit is to release music by producers frozen order admire (there are no prizes for guessing that the identity of the producers behind the horizontal releases will not be revealed that the presentation will be on anonymous hand-stamped vinyl and that the music is of a purist techno persuasion ) if the people behind this burgeoning empire of facelessness are trying to get people to focus on the music theyve succeeded the -side is based on heavy looped drums like en klocks dense housey rhythms only more pacey while a succession of yelping analogue riffs make a nod to the re-interpretation of chicago ghetto techno via landstrumms noisenik back catalogue the flip side is even trackier with our mystery man (or woman) deploying razor sharp hi-hats that cut like cheese wire through dark industrial riffs shuffling drums and a prowling bassline so yet another anonymous techno project launches however the message remains the same; you dont need a wacky haircut or to act as a pimp for a new technology company to make great techno music
fabrice lig and titonton duvant dont come from detroit or chicago but they sure sound like it the two come together here for a lovely traditional techno follow-up to a fondly remembered 7th city release in 10-inch form on londons fine rt ack in 2001 when the boys released sensual on 7th city they were hardly breaking ground with the smooth chords of even deeper but that track still sounds fresh something well likely be saying about in ten years as well lig and duvant s talent is how they seem to balance one another lig likely bringing warm emotive chords to the table duvant funking the beat up enough to keep things interesting the intriguing melody flits about sounding as though every second note is coming through leaving enough mystery for a second and third listen to help uncover everything within eanfield finds themselves on remix duties adding strings to the already smooth palate they straighten things out considerably only allowing a slight shuffle to the beat and the strings give the remix and even more upright gait driving synth arrives to prod the track forward ably turning things closer to detroit but ultimately the elements dont quite cohere as well as they do in the original lig and duvant s version is the winner here an effortless lesson in the funky possibilities of techno
south frican artist williams is best-known as rian dsouzas partner in the untie flo live show though theyve also been working together in the studio recently this years second untie flo album is a collaborative effort between the two williams second ep as is the third in a series of edits 12-inches on a huntleys palmers sub-label his previous releases had plenty of textural elements that referenced south frican music but the two cuts on vol 3 see him dive headlong into the music of his homeland the opening track is an almost-total refit of margaret singanas we re growing which was the theme tune to the well-loved south frican tv series retaining singanas stirring original vocal williams deploys an array of analogue synths adding off-kilter pads and effects echoing arps and a punching winding bassline to create a masterful crossover piece the equally compelling gozongo is an edit of mafikas killer a late 80s south frican synth-pop gem its key feature is a spectacular earworm of a vocal hook with stomping kicks and claps a delirious house piano line and periodic synth chords forming an irresistible surrounding melee oth cuts perfectly balance respect for the source material with floor-slaying house elements
this solo ep from circle traps member is the second in s gridlock series of dance floor-focused eps after joefarrs longanimity the three tracks are certainly floor-focused though never at the expense of artfulness on the face of it each one performs a fairly simple trick: surrounding thumping kicks with window dressing thats skewed beautiful or sometimes both but ward takes this premise in multiple directions making all three cuts equally worthwhile explorations of a theme from the moment opener begins creaking its way into life like an abstract sound-design piece its clear that wont just be dunderheaded warehouse jams when the kick drum finally appears its surrounding abstractions become even more vivid which was made in collaboration with circle traps member wylie is a straightforward (and excellent) mix of brutality and beauty a dense fog of acidic pads surrounds steel-toed kicks and serrated keys to create the eps most striking moment the title track spreads 90s rave synths and simmering clicks and snares over a thudding percussive spine its hard house-style snare rolls will be too much for some but as with most things here ward carries it off with self-assurance and no small amount of glee
lot of s music operates by stealth: his elusive sounds crouch in thick fog amid half-heard utterances and crunchy undergrowth is more plainspoken though it doesnt break cover entirely the title track is punchy and bold: the drums hit hard and the chords that shadow them are equally insistent bout halfway through the synth stabs fracture and then regroup in the breakdown as if caught in a brief skirmish on qu applies a little more trickery to equally compelling effect it samples a speech by an merican schoolboy dalton sherman and manipulates it to make him sound like a firebrand preacher (sherman was in fact 10 years old at the time) weeping string section and pitter-patter drums flesh out the tracks contours lovebox adopts s bludgeoning groove but qu squeezes more into its chassis chord sequence a skin-grazing shaker and blotchy vocals add a customary dash of strangeness and mystery
someone must have slipped something in matthew puffets water supply the uk producer was once best known for making seductive yet reflective techno most effectively represented on his 2001 album disconnected for delsin ut more recently youd find him remixing danny howells or here on showcasing a more upfront side to his sound focused on the dance floor the title track opens with half-heard disconcerting vocals and noisy analogue riffs that set to jacking skeletal percussion gradually dominate the track midway through puffet delivers a spacious breakdown that leads into deeper resonating chords but soon enough the grinding techno backing resurfaces to lead the track to a noisy finale however offers a more rounded take on s new-found duality ased on tight metallic claps and a plunging bass that calls to mind classic red planet or hawtin in fuse mode puffet delivers an incredible sweeping chord sequence thats equal parts eerie and evocative while it is often the case that musicality and dance floor functionality are incompatible partners puffet proves on that sometimes there are exceptions pint of whatever youre having matt

a dream team doesnt get much dreamier than this juan atkins and moritz von oswald are two artists who define the berlin-detroit axis at its best the pair has collaborated before but is their first proper album together recorded in berlin earlier this year it largely strays from techno in favour of the kind of warm jammy style of the moritz von oswald trio combining the fluid serenity of jazz with the deep resonance of dub is a relaxed affair that tries to coax the listener into a deep trance with massaging basslines and smoky atmospheres unfortunately seems to lull itself into that same sleepy state theres nary a jolt a left turn or a bump in the road the record is uniformly sequenced riffing on the same idea with identical sounds through simmering 12-minute grooves its like a pool of still water with only the occasional ripple daring to disturb the surface the first time you hear the opener electric garden (deep jazz in the garden mix) the clear tones and smooth low-frequencies are nothing short of stunning but wading in the same shallow pond feels stagnant after a while about 30 minutes in with the original mix of electric garden the leitmotif begins to wear and a persistent cricket-like sound makes the whole thing feel like a campfire version of voices from the lake things pick up with treehouse where a deflated hoover-like synth and some keyboard noodling circles around a house beat doesnt really hit its stride until the second-to-last track digital forest which sounds exactly as the collaboration does on paper: the deepest of dub techno marked by atkins signature melodic touch but then the albums over an hour of agonizingly slow build without much payoff and though the hypnotic basslines excellent as usual from von oswald they arent enough to save the record is the sound of two accomplished artists deep in their comfort zone and while it might be fun for them it doesnt do a whole lot to engage the listener
it is hard to deny curtis alan jones status of pioneer of the early nineties chicago house scene after all either as cajmere or green velvet (his main two aliases) he helped chronicle both the sheer exuberance and exhilaration of the soon-to-be-commercially-viable dance scene and its darker hmm consequences and undertones (namely hardcore partying burning brain cells up and high-on-gak losers causing interminable line-ups in big discos bathrooms) touring like crazy the entire worlds techno clubs and delivering storming live performances as that-little-black-man-with-funny-green-hair only helped solidifying his unique position over the last decade funny then how one of the american techno and house scenes most instantly recognizable voice and idiosyncratic figure could end up sounding so generic and bland on mixing duties i personally have nothing against commercial vocal house and ive been known in certain circles to do the dance-as-driving routine to call on me dance i said or the world is mine a few times but i do hold a grudge against djs who seem unable to vary pitches moods and bpms somehow joness recently released mixed album for ministry of sounds famous sessions series cant seem to find any pace equilibrium live dj sets and commercially-available dj mixes are obeying two different sets of rules obviously but judging from this double cd set you wouldnt know cajmere nor green velvet positively understand the difference consequentially all the tracks end up sounding like they all had to go through the mould of cajmeres own say you will (cd 1s opening track) - and it just doesnt stop from then on for three hours even more refined numbers such as the james holden remix of andre kramls safari or (slightly over-played) erotic discourse by paul woolford have to bow their heads down in front of pitiless tribal tracks like cajmeres i need u chabs overtly melodramatic closer to me or jerome bakers jacking but painful i need sure green velvet knows his shit - who am i to posit the opposite really - and the second cd is more enjoyable and diverse in form and content: soulwax fedde le grand (an unlikely british charts hit if there was ever one) and armand van heldens classic remix of spin spin sugar all gladly pop up but its too little too late in a world where m a n d y sven vath james holden and tiefschwarz all released refined varied and appealing double mixed cd compilations over the last twelve months who really has time for another trip down la la land seriously listening to generic tribal-lite techno and happy vocal house feels like wasting your time in some slowed-down-by-losers-on-gak bathroom line-up: in the end you know this is not where the real party is happening
luxembourgian pianist knows how to upend expectations he made his recorded debut in 2004 performing bachs complete keyboard concertos three years later he caused a stir in the classical and electronic worlds with his stately covers of autechres overand jeff millss bells and most strikingly a piano rendition of s epochal strings of life since then hes kept a presence in both worlds recording classical albums for deutsche grammophon while also getting remixed by moritz von oswald apparat and is a striking album for a number of reasons the least being that it sees release on s own label features on half of the albums tracks his singular touch appearing on a full-length for the first time in the better part of two decades and delve into vintage keyboards prophets rolands moogs to find new forward-facing sounds with s piano almost nowhere to be found no doubt refers to the belleville three members presence but its hard to parse just whose hands trigger what on the track which builds from a tricky arpeggio and extraterrestrial high frequency into exhilarating techno duo pulls components in and out now the big bassline now the hi-hats now the metallic chimes features a distant flute-like figure recessed in a muffled heavily filtered bassline slowly the low-end clarifies and s melody fans out becoming eerie and iridescent in equal measure is such a fan and is such a looming figure that it would have been easy for them to just bang out a futuristic techno album but moves into other sounds does perlon-esque minimalism builds off a classic italo-styled arpeggio and canned clap but keeps layering fidgety synth lines snaps a sweep of strings and more at the tracks climax the electronics part like a fog offering a glimpse of his resonant unadorned piano opens with s rework of ryuichi sakamotos wistful 80s soundtrack gem mr after playing the theme injects pointillist blips pinging echoes and key clacks between the piano line nudging it apart so as to find new energy and drama in its original melody a similar melody returns on album closer though this time s piano finds itself in duet with a field recording of birdsong as triggers bass and hi-hats at wide intervals nothing here quite reaches the levels of s work from three decades ago but the album holds promise that we havent heard the last of him or his fruitful partnership with
even though it has been running for an entire decade yamazaki hiros imprint has kept its output levels at a slow and steady level choosing to release full length efforts from a network of producers that hiro has made connections with during his time spent promoting in tokyo lthough the general focus has been on downtempo and ambient music up until now the labels upcoming circles collection sees producers such as shur i kan kuniyuki and all flex their respective house flavoured styles with the latter two taking up space on the compilations first vinyl sampler recent yoyo ep for cityfox displayed the darker and more taut side of his sound but his material for circles heads in exactly the opposite direction exploring a lush jazzy vibe while the lush and dreamy synth motifs of drift more than satisfactorily over the top of its loose and relaxed minimal house vibe side in is the most ear grabbing cut of the two utilising a english version of jacques brels ne me quitte pas to transition between two entirely different tracks its restrained nature on either side of the main sample means that its never going to become a peak time anthem but djs looking for a quirky and melodically refined cut to spice up their warm up or after hours sets should certainly seek this one out particularly interesting production nuance rears its head in the second half of the track with taking the vinyl crackle from the sampled recording and looping it to give an additional rhythmic edge to the bumping deep house groove the real show stealer of this 12 inch and the main reason that ive been returning to it frequently over the past few weeks is the cut tagged onto the end of the b side s its title suggests sees the cornish producer continue his aural obsession with the tb 303 but its anything but a purely nostalgic exercise it may have an infectious wiggling acid line and raw chicagoan percussion to match but s playful melodic counterpoint and efficient usage of the tracks additional elements (such as the surging synth pad specifically sculpted for maximum serotonin release) are what really make it stand out from the classic acid of the late 80s the only reason why might not be picked up by as many people as it should is its length with its short but sweet four minute duration bound to give lazy or less technically adept djs a stressful time behind the decks nevertheless this one is a nice little dance floor weapon thats likely to have as much longevity as the roland instrument that allowed its creation
has accomplished a lot in the five years since he first released with dropping his debut album and a number of eps and singles not to mention his work with studio barnhus and practically all of it has been weighed against purple drank the holy love eps ubiquitous deep house anthem so its understandable that the swedish producers second outing for which comes after a two-year dry spell would carry some special meaning however is decidedly unconcerned with expectations like anything named should be bomans a-side is steeped in wistful sentiment its in the shimmer of strings that swirl around plus-sized kicks and its in the soft patter of woody percussion most of all its in the resonant bass synth that calmly and lovingly delivers the songs pensive theme youll get swept up in the feeling of more than the groove hypnotic as it is and youre meant to this is dance music for coming off the emotional high of dance music (makes sense that it follows dj kozes xtc then ) but boman isnt one to take himself too seriously; as much as the track holds you in starry-eyed stasis it also tickles prods and winks take a moment to soak up your surroundings the next time comes on in a lengthy dj set and the memory wont soon disappear is the gush to s sigh all upward momentum jittery drums and elastic bass plucks the track is a feel-good house roller chock full of charisma boman gets a bit spacey and weird throughout almost like hes shaking the heavy emotive presence behind it and seems to lose some focus in the process youd be hard pressed to notice though especially once that stratospheric drop lifts you skyward and whenever youre ready to glide back down to earth all you have to do is flip the record
responsible for some of the more bombastic house moments on r s charts over the past few months moon harbour has gained a reputation for some big dumb and ecstatic tech house of late here though head man returns for his first single in two years with something altogether more subtle sampling some lovely latin jazz and a vocal that inevitably settles on the title phrase is as much latin house as it is tech house at certain moments tanzmann has faith enough in his percussion to lead the way without a kick drum and it makes all the difference extending out the breakdown to almost absurd lengths neither big nor dumb it is ecstatic when the kick comes back in tanzmanns second mix here is less reliant on the original sample burying it to a certain degree beneath a hefty two note-synth and a deep kick that keeps things on pace throughout in the background though you can hear quite a bit of bustling about and what seems to be a shaker mixed live in the studio just a bit higher than it should foreshadowing the moment that the latin jazz rises to the fore and takes over for the second half of the track call it a mistake call it a unique production touch call it what you will oth mixes here though are not exactly what youd expect from tanzmann and thats a very good thing
with tech houses reputation taking a battering its reassuring to know there are some corners where the winds of change simply dont blow rekids mainstay is as unlikely to veer from the style as he is to wear a v-neck vest and his return to holic trax which he helped launch 18 months ago is the beast youd expect if youve heard a record before then nothing on will surprise you theres the clattering bongo groove of et which ripples over a bass that purrs with feline grace theres also the clattering bongo groove of whant it the percussion rattling over a low-end that bumps in a minimalist groove oth showcase mc eans ability to create tension with the slightest filter tweak or ride cymbal and both have ever-looping sex vocals that lift a hypnotic groove into something that crackles with personality the bongos are nowhere to be seen on the title track perhaps because of its percussive sparseness doesnt quite bound in the same way ll the other elements are there though muted chords rolling vocals thick subs nd most importantly that utterly enveloping groove
aside from chart-topping singles like i got u and need u (100 ) has released a series of eps called for club play only which since 2012 have been an outlet for the london producers less pop-oriented material parts 1 2 and 3 all dealt in big house beats and meaty basslines only tossing in vocal samples for a melodic texture or repetitious hook the records have been largely dependable and gave tigas turbo label a solid dose of main-room fare with some bite now real name adam dyment returns four years after the last installment with its follow-up but this time its a two-track ep for defected half vocal-house throwback and half cosmic dance excursion part 4 finds the producer in his usual zone while also struggling with a new approach dyment has said of this ep the goal is to leave a legacy of dance music thatll stand the test of time in the same light that many of the artists i hold in high regard have done in the past in that way is a perfect fit for defected a mainstream label whose long history has likely influenced dyments output english singer kelli-leigh henry-davila returns after lending her voice to i got u and gives a nuanced and show-stealing performance over the by-the-numbers house beat a catchy and slick horn section enlivens the arrangement somewhat but is an otherwise prosaic retread of worn out dance music tropes is more interesting by comparison if only because it finds dyment out of his element at seven minutes its among the longest tracks filled with a skeletal arrangement of spacey arps disco-sourced bass and 126 bpm kicks and claps but what could be transportive and mesmerizing in the hands of say prins thomas feels bloodless and rote if dyment hopes to leave a legacy of dance music that will stand the test of time hell have to write his club-focused tunes with more of the ear-catching sensibility of his radio hits
the track titles on s new ep for imprint pay tribute to the english capital but the sounds are rooted in a much more vintage american aesthetic is defined by a multifarious melody that hangs above splintered woody kicks like the dim glow of an urban metropolis as seen from hundreds of feet above hakim s re-work however has a pleasing bounce to his beats and his pinging cowbells add a sense of scale to the otherwise rather contained sounds of the original s unadulterated ticks and claps drag a soft bleepy melody forward as the firm 4/4 beats punch with a satisfying pomp it feels unsettled and aggravated (as you do in traffic) but is nothing compared to the fuzzy scratchy and glitchy textures of closer a frantic sonic scribble imbued with all the frustration and tension of life in a densely populated city it wont be for everyone but brace yourself through the stark pixelated frequencies and the little moments of relief hidden within are all the more rewarding
myspace page address is http://www myspace com/djmissjools which i think is probably as telling as anything in judging her work as a producer listening to her debut ep for its clear that shes making tracks built specifically for the floor unfortunately for this release that address also points to the fact that jools first passion was always on the djing side of things starts things off solidly enough with a melodious rhythm a massed humming chorus straight out of a martin denny exotica record and strings that cut across the top problem is we dont get much past that opening gambit jools modulates the trio of elements drops in a tweak or two and waits for the magic to happen the elements are solid interesting even but rolls along in its headspace seemingly unable to mesh them together into something greater than the sum of its parts is a fine track however isnt the -side is straight-up boring for three minutes until its stolid groove relents and lets some light in lone shimmering synth appears eventually playing a starring role in the lackluster middle eight it aims seemingly for a fairy tale-esque moment of grandeur there with starry-eyed effects and a sing-songy melody but forgets to switch up the drum programming unlike say oola whose repetitive tracks are fast enough to distract this plodder is very much stuck in a rut

billed as night slugs transatlantic sibling the label and movement will be spearheaded by its brooklyn-based member kingdom and crew of likeminded artists all peddling a similar series of club nights projects and apparel alongside releases from us mongrel dance acts such as dj mikeq and setting the wheels in motion is a three track and remix package from the latter an la duo consisting of daniel pineda and asma maroof is the pairs third ep following on from mirage and their eponymous debut release launching with a collection of doomy footwork their second effort gravitated towards the night slugs mode of bass house with this one edging even closer: opener begins in a somewhat over-dramatic fashion with a twinkly clock-is-ticking key stamp before comic knife swipe samples unleash the tracks layers of throb and jukey elements but instead of feeling menacing a sardonic air prevails causing that track to fall flat and offer slightly different variants of the prescribed tumult of percussion nestled in a bed of deep rolling bass but all the melancholic synth work and ominous foot-infused subscapes sound too much like girl units wut and i r l eps causing overall to sound more night slugs than kingdoms remix of adds a signature r b vocal sweeping it off its chicago feet and transforming it into a lamenting urban ballad but its total s contribution that is the standout the friendliest of the floor-fillers he adds an intriguing dose of dark shackleton-like minimalism to an otherwise too easily forgotten ep
through a trio of idiosyncratic eps matt gardner aka terekke has carved out his own dusky corner of underground dance music after waiting more than a year for his last outing we were rewarded with another four-tracker three months later released via rush hour subsidiary no label though it introduces a new alias the self-titled ep is unquestionably terekke sticking closely to his muted funk aesthetic by now gardners hallmarks are familiar: exquisite samples stifled melodies that thin layer of distortion all of these appear on mapped to some of gardners most slamming beats the is a total club weapon with muffled house keys and jittery vocals riding bumpily over gritty kicks and a storm-cloud bassline the a2 packs as much punch and a pinch more soul sounding like a classic-era masters at work track played from inside a paper bag gardners deft manipulation and sensuous tones make it the best track here after such a hazy unfolding the crispness of the b1s kicks come as a shock though its not long before quivering pads and a distant female voice help restore that crackly feel and as for the b2 here we see gardner push his style to its limits a feel-good disco loop runs beneath a smog of distortion so thick itll have you reaching to adjust your mixer for some itll be too much but you cant help but feel like thats the point
istanbul homeboy onur ozers paranoid itchy and sexy sound is right at home on the german minimal techno label that runs at peak time at most clubs the title track on his is typical ozer: shuffling samples and intricate layers that will keep you up all night and then some tight delicate fierce and forever changing this sits right up there with troy pierces horse nation as a destroyer while on the b chugs deep with a nagging metallic melody and lead ping - less obvious stuff that s growing on me with each listen llegro might share its name with a classical outing but this one was not produced for a formal occasion: sex drenched percussion and horns create a groove that is impossible not to dance to if anything it reminds me of bruno pronsatos wade in the water children or tigerskin and ndre croms notaufnahme elsewhere a twilight re-edit comes as a digital exclusive: it s a rolling and evolving siren and sordid percussion that is my least favorite of the edits in the end this is a mixing tool - too loose fragmented and rushed to satisfy on its own terms overall this is a strong 12 that builds on ozer s earlier productions even giving tracks like bay of figs and doppelwhipper a run for its money now there s a recommendation
following a solid release from danny freakazoid cr2 returns with a house anthem from alongside the original mixes of the a-side sees haji emmanuel get into the reworking duties there is quite a nice flow to the haji emmanuel remix with smooth solid basslines keeping the track flowing alongside the main piano lines the mood and flow are superb creating a summer anthem that is sure to get some good playback in the sun in miami the original mix for me isn t as solid as the remix on the a-side due to the fact that it is a little speedier then the a-side despite this there are some nice smooth sounds such as the nice pads that surround the track and of course the main piano line
s first vinyl release was on stockholms orn free label and he appears to live up to the name hes spent time in hong kong and erlin and last years ep as satin doll was compiled from [a] backup drive on a beat-up computer in the hostel wonderland ucharest that release ranged from bleary electronica to acrid e m techno; his orn free single paired an aggro drum track with waterlogged dub house and ambient in true backpacker style young spends enough time with a given style to get the flavour before moving on s demonstrated on the aptly titled this restlessness prevents deep engagement with any one sound but it also takes his music to some surprising places starts out as slamming disco house its sprightly horns-and-vox sample pulverised by a cone-melting kick drum n it all slides abruptly out of view replaced by rickety percussion loops and what sounds like a tape-warped kalimba loop in an unrelated key its as if weve wound up in another track entirely without hope of returning to the jive on the -side is a tottering dub track its booming drums and vocal samples lashed with dub sirens it doesnt pull the same switch-up as the -side but it also never fully settles into a comfortable groove young navigates through genres stylishly but hes still looking for a place to lay his head
fter releasing over a dozen beguiling befuddling and playful disco edits the four righton blokes that comprise are finally churning out their own original productions the first single from their forthcoming album the curse of is a curious beast featuring the vocals of one-time patrick cowley vocalist jorge socarras is a monstrous dub-submerged affair as low-slung as they come socarras is playful with the lines sounding like hes putting a lime in a coconut over a thunderous and slow break that sounds like sly dunbar trying to break a levee dd to it a snake-charming violin break dropping asteroid sounds and you have a head-nodding/ head-scratching track ndrew atheralls take reveals the inherent elvis-ness of socarras vocal spraying bits of glitter with each platform-booted stomp remaking it into an oddly rockabilly-indebted remix what sounds like a siren turns into a womans wail and back into a strangulated horn sound somehow it perfectly echoes a randomly injected womans voice heard about midway through the original: what the fuck does that mean buffalo-hunting thankfully provide no answers
res plenty to get your teeth into on scott moncrieffs debut for tone control sheffield producer one-half of production team small arms fiya with toddla t uses classic house tropes as a base before throwing all kinds of toppings across it one of three tracks using yet another steel city resident pete simpson on vocals lashes a fluid funk bassline to a loop of pulsing hammond organ and a staccato guitar lick but things really come to life on a dark sample-heavy house trawl with snappy hi-hats woodblocks and a steam-driven rhythm inclusion of the sample from vic juris horizon drive as used on gang starrs mass appeal merely adds to the tasty old school flavour moncrieff comes at from an entirely different direction altogether simpsons voice this time adopting a soulful croon amid a musical setting of double bass-led downtempo house finally the stripped back kicks and percussive clacks on soon give way to simpsons chocolately vocals and an intricate bassline making its spidery way across them eventually settling down into some defected-style soul-soaked 4/4 business it all amounts to an accomplished ep thats neither overtly experimental nor wilfully mild
matthew dears twisted techno alter ego has never been as easy to love as the dark electro pop he makes under his birth name but theres no doubting his gravitational pull when it comes to attracting remixes daniel takes a classical melodic approach think slam on his reworking of deep bassy synths punch out the rhythm accompanied by swirling top notes before it breaks down into a choppy juddering breakbeat the scuba remix of the same track finds him in good form descending into dark and sweaty house through an overload of reverb finger clicks and juicy bass san franciscan charles matrixxman mcduff is given two opportunities to prove his star is in the ascendancy his singularity remix of is an express-train ride of squelching bass percussive vocal snippets and clanking beats while his replicant version works adonis-like claps into oppressive synth murmurs and snails-pace acid blips its not quite light and shade but its evidence of mcduffs depth of vision
collects together a quartet of s mainstays led out by s which tethers menacing bomber drones and mosquito hum to muffled kicks and rolling snares the labels best known associate me eschews melody for a sweaty workout of tightly wound toms rimshots and sunken sub bass on if its stripped back approach lacks a splash of intrigue thats offset by s a crunching disco stomp this one trades woodblock clicks with shimmering cymbals and wobbly bass reverb but its s contribution ay thats the most compelling here a bubbling pot of congas barked african vocals and tribal drums it takes an unexpected left turn halfway through when everything is dropped in favor of a frenzied attack of raw percussion and tambourine before reverting back to a digital afrobeat shuffle its music with clout and a a testimony to s co operative approach
in cologne the trains travel underground and overground on the same lines in the same way (german for low-floored tram ) began in the subterranean depths of tube system impressionism and emerged over the last few years to write tracks that have that elusive balance between accessibility and distinctiveness last years flucht from the lumen ep for instance nailed the classic minimal sound while others were strong with a unique atmosphere falls into the second category as the first release on their tracks platform and a preview to the bipolar full-length its pretty effective rolling late night tech a chunky acid-style bassline burbles the track along with momentum alongside raw straightforward 808-style beats theyre not splitting the atom: its simply functional techno done with skill and individuality havent produced an album since nd4 in 2002 which as previously mentioned covered the cologne transport network in 12 tracks it will be interesting to see what they do in the light of day
save for the obligatory mnml nl thread releases arrive completely out of the blue you wont see any of the self-congratulatory strictly limited or no repress facebook posts that precede so many vinyl-only releases these days and theres a good chance youll miss out on buying the record entirely unless youre already an fan dropped a few days before christmas and it collects three reworks of a track thats been doing the rounds in clubs for years long-time associate ricardo and label co-founder petre deliver the highlights theyre some of the most beautiful tracks has released if youve seen rhadoo or petre play in recent years theres a good chance youve heard its one of the few tracks officially attributed to and its undoubtedly his best (thats been released at least) it has many of the hallmarks of romanian house unintelligible vocals big sub-bass a stop-start beat and most importantly a rolling groove theres an ambiguous mood in s remix that to me is both melancholic and uplifting it rolls like the original but with a collage of stabs atmospherics and vocals has more moving parts s is even more musical retaining the dark vibe of s original dan andrei provides a rework as but its the least inspiring and most straightforward cut here its easy to see it fuelling an afterhours session but alongside the three other selections it feels one-dimensional
it seems like sooner or later every electronic artist who uses multiple aliases eventually drops the pretense and consolidates them all under one logoed awning i kind of figured that had happened with luke vibert as well it made sense: viberts done a lot of work over a long period under a few names ( for hip-hop derivations kerrier district for more disco-sounding stuff) but his recent work for planet mu his old buddy mike paradinass label pointed to a simplifying of things besides it was the work credited to luke vibert that always consolidated everything anyway viberts 2007 planet mu album chicago detroit redruth along with the carl craig remix renaissance of 2006 helped me realize just how much jam a lot of older dance artists still had so is mostly a surprise in that its definitely positively a album you can suss it from the next room is where vibert laces breakbeats with froth most determinedly theres a tipsy quality to the project thats right in line with the 50s cocktail instrumentals that is the musics spiritual and to a degree material source since 1995s throbbing pouch (one of the decades great albums ripe for rediscovery cough cough ahem ahem) has always valued levity from its sample-slingers but goes beyond that its airy sweet and tart like a good meringue its also very jokey which is probably the albums real make-or-break aspect vocal samples are a big part of the project and here vibert layers them on particularly thick: plays out with disjointed spoken bits that answer each other in line (from the latter: get on the dance floor get on it ah-one-two ah-one two ) skirting outright silliness but never quite turning into a joke vibert is too crafty for that we get a slow relaxed jungle break and whirligig hollywood strings to chew on; when the track breaks down halfway through it just turns into a lovely piece of music can whip the top into froth because the foundation is sturdy is a continuation of something began in the mid-90s and it stays true to that era a few years ago that might have seemed quaint but in sure why not

when we spoke to deep medi boss mala earlier this year he informed us that his roster had been experimenting with tempos outside of the usual 140 pm bracket applied to dubstep s is the first to come off the production line and into record shops plodding along at a sedate 94 pm its unlikely to get much club use which strikes me as a real shame after seeing much of the crowd at pinchs dubloaded party become allured by its hypnotic swagger when himself played it as a set-closer alancing woozy waves of synths with constantly morphing percussion the track takes off when the low end is introduced about halfway through fusing dirty slo-mo arpeggios with clean but full sub-bass surges has been on form with his dubstep productions over the last couple of years especially with the material that has surfaced on deep medi so it comes as no surprise that the flipside track is yet another solid effort this time hes exploring rolling technoid halfstep and although it lacks the subtlety of his best material the trilling 16-bit bleeps and thick bass are enough for it to do its job in the dance with plenty of non-140 tracks in the pipeline for deep medi dubstep-averse listeners may well want to think twice about ignoring records on the imprint
is the project of a producer from the outskirts of russia named pavel milyakov he looks after the label johns kingdom but hes probably found his widest audience in the fashion world due to his creative partnership with moscow designer gosha rubchinskiy whose runway shows he soundtracks with bracing techno and experimental music rubchinskiy and milyakov are part of a fertile moscow subculture a raw cocktail of street fashion roughshod electronic music and skateboarding a western analog could be will bankhead (milyakov formerly focused on design) at least in the way his rilogy apes imprint interacts with the hip clothing and grainy videos put out by palace he difference with and johns kingdom is evident in a look at milyakovs umblr his crew functions in an environment of grim highrises and decrepit soviet architecture making their louche nihilism feel more honest than that of their first world counterparts of course none of that would matter if wasnt an intriguing producer hough the first release arrived last year milyakovs already demonstrated an uncommon range his aw 16 soundtrack for rubchinskiy demonstrated a knack for sound design the patient experimental pieces recalling mike shiflet while the 1984 7-inch tried on new wave milyakovs bread and butter though is roughed-up techno and electro and the ep might be his most straightforward effort yet funks up an atonal modulating synth landing somewhere near rexciyas noisier side-projects or randomers awesome huh ekman who labors in the storied tradition of hollands west coast sound is a classy choice of remixer and he flips the script ever so slightly his version is electro but with a succession of kicks starting every four bars and ekman adds an unsettling synth drone to give things a paranoid feel on milyakov provides a slice of charging etroit-style techno its centerpiece is a careening madcap synth lead that makes the otherwise straight-ahead track instantly memorable milyakov wraps up the ep with some dubby chilled electro ( ) and a noisy beatless piece overlaid with a reading of mary lee halls urn again o life hat poem finds the author encouraging friends to go dutifully about these dear unfinished tasks of mine in the event of her death which falls in line with the hope i die before i get old attitude of milyakovs projects in an interview a johns kingdom member said that [the label] on the outside is a kind of a cassette label a gig heres also the johns kingdom within something no one will ever know of and any given moment all of that can disappear because death is beautiful lets hope they release a few more records before fading away
a few weeks back dj historys bill brewster took to facebook trying to get a track id for an untagged file he had been sent after a few dead ends it turned out to be the work of the band of joe gill tim hutton and heidi armitage (gill was known to be behind the party and label joes bakery but the other names are unfamiliar ) that track was from s first record and the second release from balearic social s stirring four tracks are familiar shapes twisted into new shadows the title cut may namecheck somalias capital city but it oozes tawdry tropical vibes armitages heavily treated panting and sneering brings to mind singer linda di franco as a dominatrix her voice mixes with the clean guitar upstrokes and gill and huttons squiggly low-slung synths to make for an intoxicating track and europeenes boast crisper drum programming but the murky synth stabs wiry guitar lines and compass point-style chimes keep the music balanced between balearic and dark disco closes the ep on a darker note the tracks extra space giving it more menace and heightened sexual tension as armitage puts it on be on the right side of sleazy a hissed command that the group obeys to racy results
as half of lakker dara smith makes apocalyptic techno and bass music with ian mcdonnell whose punishing solo output as eomac dates back to 2010 smith on the other hand is only now releasing music on his own but hes made quick work of distinguishing himself from his other projects reversing his first name for an alias takes on techno structures with workmanlike confidence and a keen sense of space his debut ep for uses those techniques across four hard-edged tracks that never waste time getting to the point much of evokes early 90s warp namely autechres tri repetae and the artificial intelligence comps with its unsettling sci-fi atmospheres and vintage sound banks and yet smith never seems to be looking backwards pushes a clattering stomp that holds its own in the current noise-techno climate as does the squalling pulse of sounds like a moody interlude from an ostgut ton mix album though for all the apparent stylistic references s has successfully carved out his own sound
is the newborn label set up by moodymann impersonator/heir apparent david trus me wolstonecraft whose reputation has exploded with the release of the fabulous war ep and the nearly as impressive album working nights which is easily the best album that kenny dixon jr never produced 2 is a proper ep in the sense that it brings together three disparate but not disconnected arrangements all different and all interesting the is the one that s getting all the hype and play and it s no surprise why: it s as chic a piece of jazzy house as i ve heard since the glittering second heyday of the deep sound of the late 90s think norma jean ell ibex common factor s world is mine and larry heard s trackmode compilations of that time the arrangement is neat but the real feature here is the vocal on first listen my instant reaction was shit who s this they can really sing nd lo and behold it s a beyond the grave sample of minnie ripperton (hence ) and this is a dedication that does her legacy proud my one complaint with this track is that it ends right where a big build should be ut then again that just makes you wanna hit replay the sides are less obvious as all good sides should be but (arguably) more interesting i wonder what will become of the side logic with the death of vinyl becomes a dusty fact nyway the 1 by regie and piranhahead as napiheadz performs a weird rhythmic inversion beginning with a nose forward house groove that slowly (and disconcertingly at first) gets all arse about snout as it rediscovers itself as a reggae number ut thankfully for the house djs among you the reggae is re subsumed by old faithful as the boom boom returns just in time for your segue the 2 which apparently cropped up on an old theo parrish mix a few years back is very detroit minimal house by regie and works either as a tool for the more vocally inclined or a precious and undertated slab of mumbling grooves for those who like it late and lean overall a varied accomplished and interesting ep from a promising young label
in ras real scenes: los angeles film describes dance music and clubbing as a search for nirvana most of his releases such as s house jeans and surface tracks 1 eps have taken a pretty straight route of solid 4/4s and deep pads to get there but 2015s sleep quarters ep for wandered into more meditative ambient as if he was to paraphrase matthewdavid in the same film just as interested in giving people some healing after fucking them up in the club caswell largely returns to this more spiritual side on his debut album for doesnt quite put on the full tie-dye kaftan but its coloured with many of the new age tropes beloved by some of his southern california contemporaries track subtitles and have overtones of self-help books and caswell has said that the album is about growing past and through a place of comfort res also more than a whiff of fragrant smoke here opening and closing tracks seem to billow out and dissipate like incense and the music in between often curls into lovely shapes that barely linger before theyre gone can feel either alluring or frustratingly lethargic depending on your state of mind two of the most propulsive tracks and dannys come near the beginning of the album from that point on the rhythms slow almost to a crawl by the beautifully aquatic theyve dropped out altogether following which revolves around a guitar motif that crackles like a campfire also goes for the soothing and celestial but the frisky house of though far from banging feels about as jarring as nosebleed gabba following s eight minutes of ambient meandering still gives a welcome shot of energy if theres one criticism of caswells ambient productions its that for all their beauty theyre sometimes too light and insubstantial for their own good but as a showcase of caswells two musical personalities is a qualified success even if it fails to form a coherent whole
delivered in a gorgeous 12 inch sized booklet showcasing clubs strong affinity to contemporary art is a beautiful object thats no surprise really frankfurt club is home to a minimalist and ever changing interior design so it would stand to reason that packaging for ir entry into mix cd sweepstakes would be just as elegant whats perhaps more pertinent though is that as stunning as it is to look at chlo s debut mix in series is just as absorbing to listen to termed hypo rmic dance music parisian /producers mix conjures images of necrotic limbs and frozen articulations a gothic lite trope that kill probably wish yd come up with mselves what that means technically speaking is a mix that starts at 101 bpm with slow motion grooves of female german oddball which n stays around 120 mark for almost an hour until peaking at 125 with a joakim remix of indie rockers in terms of subtle tension building and craftsmanship its exemplary fascinating thing is what she chooses to do it with: chlo s selection ignores understood imperative of sounding current half of tracks included here were released in 2007 which seems counter intuitive if you think of mixes as harbingers of trends/movements/whatevers fur rmore bar those and (chlo with fellow parisian krikor collaborating) exclusives res nothing really new or unreleased; chances are with tracks such as steve re edit of s and s circumvallating youve heard some of se tunes numerous times before her desire to revisit recent forgotten tech house of or laven mso (featuring whose almost baritone voice is only heartwarming if you can call it that moment of entire mix) can be peculiar but it perfectly suits her aims of marching to pace of her own drum machine with rise of podcasts and like many are predicting death of mix cd chlo s distant yet engaging offering icy and communal all at once proves res life in format yet and without getting too carried away here its fair to say that with upcoming mixes scheduled from prins thomas gerd janson and ivan smagghe will quite possibly be most intriguing mix series of year
judging by his breakout hit keep callin mccorry has mostly been concerned with breaking things apart keeping the sensuality of his r b samples but reshaping them in the image of new instrumental grime on his second ep mccorry seems to have moved from chopping to pitching the excellent title track features a chorus of r b voices sped up until they sound like celestial chipmunks mccorry still leans heavily on the scissor tool but he keeps a more solid groove all the better to effect his sickly soul overload is equally giddy with a jazzy bassline and canned strings that sound almost comically rapid centring the ep is s first released vocal collaboration mc of south london crew the square doesnt dazzle over the yes extremely high-pitched but even if he takes a little long to get going the track demonstrates how well s colourful music can accommodate a voice elsewhere he loses momentum when piling on extra detail with its trilling melody and bloated squarewave bass just about carries it but the gloomy bb feels like a needless addition the producers slicing skills are deployed without his usual focus and the aimless synth melodies laid on top do little to improve things
never one to shy away from a new project the 103rd release from new yorks is by the mysterious referencing the shaanxi province in northwest china the s ep is the producers (or producers) debut outing presenting four tracks of stuttering heavily rhythmic machine music opens with a set of gently rising shimmers laid atop a fractured drum loop sunshine pads soon enter the fray merging and swelling to form an ethereal and deeply moving texture i toes a similar line while packing a little more drive by now the shimmers have become lively gracefully parading over sparse kicks is more muscular still honing the escalating flickers into darting synths and strapping a thumping live drum break beneath for added impact listen to the ep chronologically and youll realise theres a dialogue between the tracks: they all use related tools to conjure comparable if increasingly more intense atmospheres its an approach that gives the release a homogenous album-like feel closing track resets the balance winding down this affecting debut in a soothing swirl of dainty synths and twilight pads
with each successive release swedens sam forsberg shows himself to be an adventurous producer whose wide-ranging tastes are matched by his willingness to collaborate with an international cadre of producers he worked with max stenerudh as kwc 92 and on a recent album for snaker and paired with chinas tzusing on the juicy hollabackboi he now partners with takenori goto from tokyos cos/mes t first the pounding kick and closed hi-hat of scans as the most straight-ahead club-friendly track from either producer in a while ut a bubbling synth figure slowly moves up a muffled drum tumbles in the background and dubbed-out elements slide across the streamlined track just enough wooziness and texture is added to the pounding rhythm the squishy ebullient -side edges out as the highlight it also boasts a meaty kick but even as video-game gurgle intensifies the thump 5ive samo dj keep things balanced they sprinkle in a chopped xylophone sample and shimmering electric piano rather than making the melody heed the beat they let it meander across the track giving it just enough light
you say balearic i say incidental 80s tv music but whatever you want to call londoner-gone-to-tokyo producer he knows how to make it work hes released more robust music than the four cuts on this ep but s plastic synth glide relaxed rock-disco beats and clucking rhythm guitar are on a comfortable cruise control here its a persuasive argument for the pleasures of essas type of formalism the neon glow and lockstep one-finger keyboard bassline of give it a faded luster thats like a contemplative stroll down the sunset strip in the moments before the bars close and a is here in two mixes essas own dub works up a measured froth those weve got got vocal dabs give it some propulsion and so does a b-line that sounds like it was found in one of bernard edwards coat pockets while visti s remix hews to the original song structure while building a synth-sheet swell that keeps rising till it finally ends the dub mix of out of opens with the eps straightest disco beat and its most rock-like guitar but otherwise hews to the essa basics
strictly in the song sense is a great one it s a soulful house number that dips into disco territory and it has diva vocals that would melt any self-respecting queens heart it also does exactly what it sets out do: the pianos tinkle the synths blurt the bass follows dutifully along i suspect that is the problem in a way s perfect as it is feels disconnected from itself those aforementioned elements play out fine but they never play with one another making the track a hollow shell of what it could be blame it on the production i suppose but this is one track that sounds clearly like digital disco and not the good ol fashioned live stuff this wouldnt be so much of a problem if sebastian doering werent so obviously aiming for an old school aesthetic but he is nd as a result holly backlers vocals sound less like a celebration and more like a confession the dubfuck mix on the other hand embraces its digitalia and is all the better for it more obviously synthesized beat sets the stage for backler s voice to be sliced before a french filter sweep sends us off to a (minor) climax n altogether disappointing follow-up to the stunning modern stalking ep

its no coinci nce that close friend carl craigs imprint is home to both and its accompanying single release the mighty are ; craig and larkin came up through the detroit techno ranks together following parallel career paths up to a point the fork in the road came when after releasing a handful of classic singles and two outstanding albums ( azymuth and taphor ) larkin chose to follow his dream of becoming a stand-up comic while craig soldiered on becoming one of the most creative consistent and prolific voices the motor city has produced larkins tunes are somewhat similar to craigs in fact full of alien funk layers of textural noises and hairpin compositional curves while maintaining a clear eye on the floor while craigs material tends to be heavy on the percussion si larkin has always been more melodic musically speaking then its like larkin never left opener starts with a marching line of percussive keyboard phrases and (of course) tambourines before rolling off into a classic-sounding detroit groove all atmospheric synths and expertly woven rhythm patterns works a late-night vibe with its scatting keys and snappy house patterns while is a minimal hip-shake littered with percussive noises that burble and bloop into a sick groove the cd version of the album also inclu s the light version of the are single a manic shuffler over which larkin rants and raves about your greatness his booming voice adding to the apocalyptic feel of the track as well as the original mix of the singles b-si the plastikman-like drum workout (did i mention that larkin was the first signing to hawtins plus 8 label too ) throughout the album larkin peppers his elegant tech-house rhythms with jazzy keyboard fills strings tambourines and oddball synth blurts making for an especially tuneful listen that doesnt skimp on the ass-shaking fans of larkins classic works will not be disappointed here nor will those discovering his music for the first time (a likely case consi ring how long hes been out of the game) heres hoping he sticks around this time and lives up to the promise of his early career
london trio (miss jools and udiofly aka nthony middleton and luca saporito) are archetypal minimalists their sound is as neat dry and shaken as a james ond martini is only their third release but it comes anticipated: earlier hits freefall (for sixty four records) and full of you (also for ) got plenty of turntable time making appearances on a number of compilations including tiefschwarzs fabric 29 where those tracks proudly swaggered however mobilee028 treads rather limply oth pieces here are sorely in need of dutch courage rattles away to 16th-note hats and the rhythmic whack-whack of drumsticks while a fishtank gurgles up and down the scale the halfway mark brings a pretty blip line which lifts the bar slightly but not sufficiently the title track is stronger but it too takes its time lonely prog pads in the opening seconds herald portent and dread but these vanish replaced by familiar barren tics a triangle solo and a melody tapped out on plastic bottles y the eight minute mark these elements have cohered into something swinging but by then its all over in sets these might work but these textbook cases are hardly essential

is fast becoming livity sounds unofficial fourth member with a pair of singles for their sub-label last years ounce and now forming a neat complement to the output of peverelist kowton and susu like livity sound coulton produces dark percussion-centric house and techno eyond that his style is rather chameleonic falling somewhere between the 130 pm rollers of eneath and the syncopations explored by tessela and others hes also produced fairly straightforward house but at times his spartan arrangements have felt a little monochrome his releases for livity however seem to bring out his more adventurous side last years ounce with its sinuous syncopations and parched dub aesthetic could almost have been a recent peverelist production though thats not to detract from the impact of its ideas its follow-up is equally fine and more singular too is essentially a highly distilled beat track but in the best livity tradition its groove challenges rather than seduces the dance floor the boxy stumbling drums are reminiscent of coultons recent too much talk but here theyre even more dysfunctional alternating between a hesitant lilt and swung rhythms in the breakdown meanwhile is a little more conventional its pitch black 4/4 thud and woody percussive patterns would be fairly so-so were it not for the rich smoky delay effects that increasingly dominate in the latter half
this latest release bears several hallmarks the side offers a prelude to a forthcoming album produced by the norwegian which is complemented by yet another stellar collaboration with an artist from the extended sex tags universe depending on when you bought it this record may arrive in different formats i dropped 20 for a white label prerelease edition which arrived as a 12 inch finished copies are a ten inch fans of finnish electro funk may be familiar with ilari larjosto and niko liinamaas long running collaboration larjosto is more recognisable to these ears for his work as stiletti na which includes a 2014 fett urger collaboration on sex tags ufo appears here ahead of the new produced lp for s hk s house focused keys of life label non album track from the lps recording sessions is a 111 pm head nodder rich with the organic feeling scandinavia does so well curiosity about the and collaboration inspired my blind purchase their side track doesnt disappoint the full nine minutes are used to unfurl a dazzling saunter through the outer cosmos with far off hints of percussion and synth droplets remaining constants while various ambient movements are revealed its title makes you wonder if is just one version of a track and worked on the sex tags universe would be an even better place with more of these joint efforts
is a project from daniel martin-mccormick who recently announced the retirement of his ital name is the fourth in a series of eps from whose name is actually a red herring the music is tense a series of horror screams set the tone on which one can only assume is an homage to curtis if it was faster it could be goa trance is steely techno mixed with atonal drone that sets your teeth on edge is drumless with an anti-melody feels incomplete a feeling thats enhanced by muffled fragments of dialogue theres an overriding sense of disorientation on with maniacal screaming that buts against synth delirium and ominous uneasiness what it misses in dance floor funk is made up for with drama
amsterdams label has been run by marsel van der wielen for the better part of 12 years originally happy to explore anything and everything to do with electronic music the label is now firmly rooted in releasing big club tracks particularly with detroit flavoured stylings but whereas reverence towards the past and to distant places has often been the undoing of lesser labels marsel and have been able to reinvigorate their sound by constantly bringing in new talent to refresh and complement the more established names this is after all the label who gave debuts to aardvarck and while simultaneously releasing solid tracks by rolando and amongst others most but not all appear here but the point is loud and clear: van der wielen simply has one of the best ears for dance music around ts almost impossible to pick a starting point across all 23 tracks there is a sustained intensity that makes it so that each track seems to be better than the last style is most certainly detroit influenced though s is perhaps the quintessence of this sound being both bubbling and driving whereas his is more stripped back and electro fuelled africa which opens things s chiming and also flirt heavily with the motor city sound s from blends old school synth and percussion with taut jazz keyboards while the piano led closing track solitude diverges into an upbeat world of jazz and light cleverly rips up the 4 4 and splatters it back in restless broken pieces s two short tracks are both watery in keeping with his moniker fast ambient surge of ripples upwards like a fountain while the bass weight undertow in works like a spoiler to keep the ride low to ground s of wonders builds and builds using its speed subtle polyrhythms and coagulating drones to stretch the dub techno patterns to their breaking point meanwhile manages to gleefully destroy his own with the stripped version that mashes morse code and brutal funk together without sympathy on the other hand is a classic analogue workout from the masked crusader whereas is sharp and sleazy and slots in nicely with his other releases sounds unsurprisingly like foreshadowing last years ding the past with with a track from 2006 and s beautifully seductive track and s two pieces cool things down ever so slightly with some of the more house flavoured moments of the set but it wouldnt be without marsel his track that remains under his moniker and in collaboration with again digs deep into the detroit sound with lashings of 80s synth pop and offbeat piano licks intelligently propped up against the bass
kicking off in style records are proud to deliver two new signings to their label the first of these being skydive recordings following on from their awesome remix of bill vega new decades running scared released early 2004 - a mix that took dark and nasty bass to a different level - rna bss present two dark and dirty numbers packed with tonnes of grunt side a human voices an intro comprised of a dirty tech hook and a clean rocky bassline sets the tone for the track utilising plenty of vocal stabs and drum fills to good effect after a quick beatdrop a melodic bassline kicks in with a very familiar melody (cant quite put my finger on it) so one is left with the tune stuck in their head for some time towards the end show off their true colours by incorporating quirky electro stabs and managing to give the drummer some by letting the rock style break get busy for a few bars side b 2 close opening up with a mellow drum break and deep bassline the tune quicky progresses into a tough yet progressive breaks tune featuring intelligent drum programming - punchy snares stabby kick drums and crisp hi-hats and a acid like electro bassline that tends to fade in and fade out with good effect
sydneys jordan feller has been skirting the fringes of house and techno for a while now hes best known for his blog-friendly electro as a project he started with a fellow sydneysider in the late 00s but has since taken solo while a duo caught attention with a series of hyperactive compression-heavy eps on ang gang 12-inches a label that once housed a number of the main players in ed anger-inspired ustralian dance music feller has dropped a few tracks since went solo but his recent record on is something of a turning point as it seems to be his first real step towards traditional house if tells us anything its that feller now looks to l i e s and the trilogy tapes more than justice and usy p the eps three tracks have a smoky aesthetic stacked with with abrasive samples and should do well with djs looking for edgy tracks to pad their bags with the loopy is the clear pick of the bunch and a pleasant exercise in give-and-take unlike on the all-too-familiar sounds of the rest of the record fellers voice is clearly heard
this release from featured in chris fortiers bedrock release has an intense tribal feel to it crafted beats and subtle effects are merged throughout the track the beats gain intensity late on as a stabbing effect strikes with force to punch in the effectiveness of the record one for the tribal folks this on the flip is mara s broken elbow mix of timecrash a nicely crafted 4/4 pattern is the key early as a subtle but apparent baseline is introduced to drive the track forward the trademark effects and swirls of mara s work are featured as the effects late in the track go wild another brilliant deep production by mara

is a label run by uk artists and joe ellis both are residents at the welsh festival freerotation which speaks to their style as djs and label curators their sound is moody stripped down and spaced out y launched the label in 2012 with s 3200 b c dancer a dark and atmospheric record that was quietly one of the best house eps of the year ir fourth release is a mini-compilation featuring and three close friends of the family: and every track on 004 strikes a different mood but they all share a drab and slightly warped aesthetic s is an understated warehouse track that starts out feeling half-asleep and then becomes more driving and sinister as it goes s is similarly dreamlike but more blissed-out with a long ambient intro gliding drums and half-euphoric pads with its mean drums and work-it vocal sample s is clubbiest thing here though it maintains the eps gloomy feel finishes with a delicate and emotive sketch that underlines the labels special touch for ambience
continues his excellent run of techno with this debut on blueprint often listen to high-energy dance music at work but m pathy is a track that ve actually had to turn off several times because it gets me too stressed out: its pure panic lead line is right at the most caustic end of dance music and the kicks pound bloody-mindedly res a gyrating funk to it as well something thats stripped barer in which has loopy robotic grinding a sharp offbeat hi-hat and a wide-arsed bassline and sounds like a radio transmission from deep space ts pretty opposite to the other two nerve-wise but all of them completely nail what theyre going for
if sounds like a strange name for a label thats because its an offshoot of pullproxy an artist management agency based in berlin their first release came earlier this year company co-founder dave turov teaming up with john selway for choo got it this next one is courtesy of himself the owner of two labels and a fixture on germanys production circuit opens with a soaring synth line and double-time claps at first it almost feels like 2005s discopolis from lifelike and kris menace the similarity ends quickly however with brocksieper shutting down this big riff in favour of a driving rhythm section and swirling chords its only in the breakdown that the overarching synth work returns injecting some much-needed emotion but ultimately failing to make much impact quenums remix swaps out the cantering techno substrate for head-bobbing tech house like brocksieper however hes cautious with the melodic elements and doesnt make a distinctive impression jonas s remix is a good example of why he repeatedly appears on eps in this role offering up his usual heads-down take on techno a big floppy kick underpins the argentinians focussed cut its matched by an equally wobbly low-end which smatters with darting claps and hats midway through he introduces a splashing ride cymbal and ushers in an emaciated version of the originals lively synth work spread long and thin this acts as a sustained pad to support s noisesome percussion as it crashes towards home the remaining two tracks are well-pieced together but seem to be missing something timbrally plays off two disparate melodies against one another the first a kind of vacillating squeaking the second a less-frequent and faintly trancey arpeggio in slurred voices spill out across the spectrum like sludge underscored by sharp niggling tones and toppling snare hits
for someone with a seemingly warm and genial personality the music of rinse fms grimey reakfast show host is jarringly dark even nasty the man known as scratcha dv leon smart or any combination of the three submerges the misty-eyed bliss of uk funky in bubbling pits of tar the results are apocalyptic (his recent new world order is the sound of the world ending) or severely reduced like the acid-eaten skeleton of his debut natty smarts second release for kode9s enigmatic label is an update on his debut pasting colourful streamers and tacky cutouts onto natty the gaudy decor does wonders for the newly-christened transforming its bottomless void into a decisive stomp the onus is clearly on the powerful vocal from eglo records london-via-sweden star whose melodies find previously invisible corners and crevices to interrogate; suddenly natty is a spacious jam with heated synth veins that swell and glow like planetarium light shows her brilliant performance serves to shatter conceptions of what releases are supposed to sound like the celebratory implosions resulting in something like the rainbow confetti pictured on the records label the tracks second half is more unstable as the raw nerves of natty are exposed only to melt away and pool in a goopy mess of filters on the floor this isnt your average uk funky banger exhausting all his vitamin d with smart returns to the severe industrial aesthetic of his most recent work with which sounds like natty smoothed out over an ironing board namely rather flat workmanlike with little flair its a useful tool but its airless composition is simply suffocating without the gasping-for-air thrill of other funky flirtations that of course has its merits as well but after the hysteria of it falls short of the diamond standard
records is a label based in malta their first release is a 3-track ep featuring tracks from melchior sultan dj nojz and sir round this ep is straight-up hard and fast techno the standout track has to be reaction functions by melchior sultana it has great beats driving percussion short drops and loopy synths overall the production quality does appear to be sonically better than the other two tracks on the ep not a ground breaking release by any means but that does not appear to be the aim behind this label instead this label is about 3 friends who have joined forces to help put their own music out to the general public as well as the music of their fellow country men all for their love and passion for techno
in the three years since his debut single on cadenza frankfurts frank heinrich has established himself as the designer of some of latin-oriented house musics most microscopically constructed rhythms and shape-shifting sonics his productions meld the organic conga beats that so dominated late-hour house music a couple of years ago with mesmerizing and intricate sounds and timbres turning his steady often tribal beats into strange clamors of sound fitting then that heinrich aka has since spread tracks across some of dance musics headiest heavies including cocoon ricardo villalobos sei es drum and motivbank for his debut lp though returns to the imprint with which he began lucianos cadenza under fire in certain circles the last few years for failing to evolve beyond the high-end bongo house the label was so instrumental in popularizing and for their inability to make the leap to the dreaded dance full-length the result a buddhist term which means roughly both emptiness and impermanence is sure to remind people of just what made the label so intrinsic in bringing those global beats and textures to prominence in the first place simply stated is most certainly a cadenza record marked by the blending of eerie synth lines hazy melodies and hypnotic noise-play into open ended rhythms pounded from cymbals shakers woodblocks congas bells and drum machines but as with many of the labels best releases its the break-in-the-cloud moments those transitions into sudden melodic lines sewn deep within their beat patterns as on or that necessitate repeated visits much of this immediacy is at first masked by s meticulous sonic layering; sounds almost rubbery at times with its shifting pitches electronic pings zings and creaking noises bent into elastic shapes and passages that you ride more than you listen in on as such its the consummate headphone lovers record slow to reveal many of its embellishments both and highlight are particularly dense almost grainy epics that begin as steady organic jams only to retreat into themselves completely; the melody that emerges from the latter sounds like a circus organ half-buried in sand muffled and sad at one moment foregrounded the next stranded somewhere between detroit house and salsa shuffle is delirious fun too a jumpy floor-filler its organ dizzy vocal samples and a distant piano accelerate into a sweaty grind that almost seems to topple headfirst elsewhere with its watery bassline and quiet pinging sounds shades its distorted melody in quiet electronic murk in fact its that very sense of sub-surface focus on the feeling that so much is snaking in play beneath the top that makes the record such a grower both for home listening purposes and the late-night hours
san francisco has always been the home of free love and summer vibrations ever since the flower children of the 70s invaded the consciousness of the mainstream audience thirty-years have past and the tradition is still strong as labels like the citys very own om records have propelled the sensual sounds of house music into deeper levels while still keeping the essence of that 80s funk with this recent volume founder dj fluid projects the current and future sounds that define the label with sounds of om v 5 with five installments out now you must think that the label is doing something right to warrant so many sequels - and they are as dj fluid crafts a delightful cocktail of silky grooves over luscious vocals that works in both a laid-back surrounding while still keeping the music upbeat and fun layered well over one another theres empty space for you to take a break forgoing any introduction dj fluid rolls bass kicks with the pumping electro glitz from andy caldwells the waiting game with those first notes the mix puts you three hours ahead of time into the middle of a set already in progress no need to wait in line it seems but the rush of excitement doesnt feel necessary what does help the compilation is the spacing of warm vocals between tracks and the limited use of breakdowns instead of trying to build peaks fluids portrait consist of a steady brush that simply rides the tide over the course of the fifth volume you figure this isnt so different than any other record youre heard before and you would be right but the programming is consistent and the music sleeps well against one another it doesnt get big until johnny fiascos can you feel it go back-to-back with kaskades everything as they sizzle lifting sounds of om up a notch as a whole the compilation is radiant with golden rays of light; warm and summery in flavor - its still a stellar summer outing for the winter chills tracklist 1 andy caldwell - the waiting game 2 kaskade ft colette - i like the way (troydon mix) 3 mark farina - dream machine (dj fluid mix) 4 colette - feelin hypnotized (jason hodges mix) 5 rithma ft ryralio dj - the funk is still alive 6 joshua karl injex - the sun the moon the stars 7 kaskade - move 8 jt donaldson ft symphony - trust me (broadway wilson mix) 9 greenskeepers - slippin 10 johnny fiasco - can you feel it 11 kaskade - everything (kaskades big room mix) 12 solidarity - find a way (jay-js moulton mix) 13 kaskade - sweet love (marques wyatts deep love mix) 14 king kooba - indian summer </ir
the latest 12-inch from sergio moreira is probably s only house record to sample a charles manson monologue strangely the point manson is making falls in line with some of s philosophies system we live in is sustained by nothing more than a big lie said the groups laurine in an interview earlier this year she and her crew have always had a political streak but that hasnt come through in their music s changed with which thanks to the speech on the ndr s-style opener puts moreiras worldview on the table truth has been in your stockyards your slaughterhouses goes the sampled speech its paired with one the most straightforward rhythms moreira a broken-beat jedi has ever put his name to it should appeal to house djs who would have trouble placing his more abstract tracks in a set and are more like moreiras usual sound spacey and complex latter gets reworked into an even spacier ambient tune by newcomer indi an alias of s graphic designer santi uribe it rounds off another strong release from one of berlins classiest labels
res no question what space the veteran canadian techno producer and dj sees his tracks filling: its huge dark and loud and everyone inside it has their hands up the digital imprint of turkish techno head ferhat has a similar vision and both label and artist feel like a good fit for one another on ep gows latest while theres nothing cutting-edge or adventurous about either of gows originals hes got stores of energy title cut goes for more of a house feel letting cloudy chords fill the beat and dissipate like fog machine bursts is more of a squelcher: all booming kicks and laser light shows its a little too huge sonically and too lightweight formally to work anywhere except in the most muscular of dj sets though i expect thats not a problem for anyone involved whose own music has been featured on nearly all of jetons releases may have contributed the most interesting track on the release in the form of his remix: though punishingly heavy and strictly devoid of melody its intensity manifests itself not through layers but by the sheer insistence of its bass pulse if its not already apparent ep is strictly for big room jocks and the endless sea of dancers surrounding them

so the story goes was the disco jewel of dresden newcomer s live show unearthed by s ever astute a r operation (ie gerd janson) at the toronto leg of the r ma things become more interesting when you consider that this deal was cut over 30 months ago yet appears now in the latter stages of to slot neatly into the catalog without the imprint having to break its stride title track arrives like a time traveling salsoul number thats just stepped out of the vessel everything residing above the kick drum is treated with a joyous shimmering coat from the spiral staircase lead line to the push-pull strings and arpegiated bass line an upturned insect struggling on its back the track does flip to reveal a darkened underbelly but soon resolves itself and scurries off on its sunny way offers a comparatively brooding yet half as satisfying lurch towards techier-territory a synth line reminiscent of omar-s u piques the interest but the straight-out the box hats and more markedly the disjointed clap dont play so well with it prins diskomiks of the is a pleasant enough 13 minutes of slackened drums and fuzzy guitars but feels too much like a straight-up live cover version magine lcd soundsystem forming a tribute band and youll be most of the way there the norwegians finest hour but version does at least serve to shine a light on the strength of the source material although the strike rate tallies to one out of three this release by no means signals a drying of the run; rather another facet in its intriguing discography
a new label arm of dave twomeys techno party in tokyo starts on a high note with he couldnt have picked a better pair of artists to help begin his latest endeavor than and two previous guests at the party but first twomey himself offers something of a mission statement with working under the moniker he crafts a sub aquatic soundscape filled with throbbing bass hissing noise and an interview with the marine explorer picard in which he describes his 1960 journey to the bottom of the sea looks to the past with a remastered version of a track he originally released as a test pressing on his own label geophone back in 2008 fans of s distinctively trippy analog style will likely rejoice in the decision to give it a proper release it features a 15 beat pattern that spirals endlessly downward (and inward if you try to mix it with a conventional 4/4 track) and certainly ranks as one of his more challenging recent efforts tokyos finishes off this fine release with the nine minute long a ored by soft thumping kick drums and a smooth 303 line punctuated by otherworldly growls and immersed in shimmering ambiance it suggests that theres much more than darkness to be found in the oceans depths

tr ger is now europe s premier techno inprint no mean feat for a label that s only seventeen releases in it s a reputation that will only be consolidated when marcel dettmann s outstanding erghain 02 drops in june and in anticipation of the big release o ton has released two vinyl eps comprised of new tracks by its affiliated artists all of which make an appearance on dettmann s mix the first of the two eps featured two outstanding cuts from shed and tobias but here it s the turn of finnish unknown and erghain resident few bars into s and my brain makes an immediate (and pleasurable) neural connection: garnier s crispy acon the commonality with garnier s old timey floor destroyer is the throaty tone of the bass synth which has the loose rumble of a big bore v8 growling out a revved ode to its favourite oompah band where it updates this classic approach is with the distinctly high tech sound design not least of all the washes of sparkles that dance across the speakers like burning magnesium off a sparkler s track is slightly less impressive but still rock solid the connections here are less to motorsport and more to the classic loop driven techno of 96 04 mostly because of the rolling bells that carry the groove through the night ut unlike the old loop stuff s track is much much slower and deeper and with richer sweeter sounds than you d usually hear on the old tracks with the insectoid incessancy of their hat patterns i should add that this track has an absolutely massive floor shaking kick which i m sure is even more brutal if the vinyl version plays at 45 perfect for the big gay vikings of the erghain main floor if you re interested in knowing where techno is at in this is it
having toured a number of major festivals over the past year with the likes of machinedrum and nguzunguzu paul is currently enjoying a lift in profile within stateside bass circles the l label thats partly responsible for his success now brings back for their first release of ll five inclusions feel like frenetic bastardisations of instrumental hip-hop a and q both evoke dave taylors output as switch while is reminiscent of starkeys philly-bass contrasts horror sound-effects over a backdrop of key-heavy garage with the footwork-paced being the other notable pick wont mark out as a new pack leader but there are plenty of promising aspects here to suggest his best is yet to come
there s deep and there s david alvarado originally released as an ep transfiguration has been fleshed out into a nine track album providing the ideal nocturnal soundtrack alvarado seems to have got the house/techno blend just right with the beats tough enough to lift the music above water with slow moving chord progressions complemented by various subtle production noises the whole thing unfolds at a natural unhurried pace the structure of each tune changing just as you d expect it to mind you the last thing that can be said about this record is that it s boring and predictable after a blissful intro with light beats alvarado turns on the kick for luna with lots of smoky atmospherics flitting around raindance goes downtempo hitting a nice groove while sol is the tour de force a tightly structured groove with a superbly done break in the middle with alvarado leaving half the bass drum in the mix meanwhile the warmth of the breaks in but why segues neatly into the straight techy house beat of aire showing his versatility as a producer transfiguration is a no frills release with every sound worth its place in the overall picture alvarado knows just how to make a good deep groove and does it with great simplicity on this classy record
the lead single to aquaskys teamplayers upcoming album overneath gets the remix treatment courtesy of friendly to cater for the breakbeat heads and also dbridge for the drumnbass massive side a overneath (friendly remix) friendly takes the bassline in its original form and layers it over a signature friendly break - very similar to the one used in bump grind for those who havent heard it he uses very subtle kicks and thin snares to create a somewhat mellow break with plenty of crossover appeal apart from a few variations in the bassline melody and a bigger breakdown there isnt much difference with the original other than the fact that this has more syncopation in it side aa overneath (dbridge remix) upping the tempo to a whopping 175 bpms dbridges remix goes on a much different tangent taking the bassline and giving it a complete overhaul - a new melody and the bassline progressively gets darker and harder as the tune progresses yep the viagra is working the vocal stabs play a bigger part and a few dark synth sweeps get thrown into the background as well as the introduction of new electro stabs while friendlys remix is aimed for the breaks heads it really doesnt offer much other than a breakbeat youd be better off with the original tune and its harder beats
in the time between the new ep suddenly being released and this review being written had already become the most divisive moment of will bevans career a clear change of direction from his post- untrue material this gorgeous frequently poppy ep was already being criticised by fans who appear to want bevan to retread his second album for the rest of his career at least as forceful however were the voices of those ensnared by the emotional punch and unapologetic beauty of these three tracks all three cuts unfold over more than one act lending the release a mini-album feel the title track has three movements with a submerged amen break a familiarly distorted vocal and rushing chords eventually giving way to a pumping bassline that meshes with hip-hop vocal samples ethereal voices and glistening chords eventually take over to bring things to a close is a warming winter pop song that chimes into life slowly and peaks with a hopeful vocal and pulsing beat its main section is about the length of a traditional pop song and provides a sweet rush; the haunting interlude of chords and samples that follows is a fitting comedown 13-minute closer blossoms into something almost christmassy its alternately clear and distorted chimes periodically rising in glorious unison with a meditative vocal it completes an almost unbearably romantic melodious whole debate will rage indefinitely on its merits but to my ears places in a new creative sweet spot

s first full-length for continues to explore david letteliers concept-informed take on techno it further explores a sense of crisis established by his last album 2015s cory arcane in which an unstable protagonist contemplated the crumbling of a system examines similar themes of technology communication and capitalism in a three-part narrative that describes three types of desire: primal sensual lust emotional catharsis a blissful desire for love and in a reference to the praying mantis of the albums title destructive fatal attraction theres an urgency to much of its crunchy basslines seem to search for resolution is one of the albums more elegant tracks with an emotional melody that gently raises your heart rate in the same way a looping synth line in which sounds like a sample from an epic movie soundtrack gives a sense of something about to start but never quite beginning for the most part though the album bears its teeth the flinty acid of the rasping bassline on and s drone layers convey a measured aggression as an electronic medium adept in emotional and physical manipulation techno letellier suggests is an act of resistance in an increasingly disconnected world also aims to express more immediate emotions the albums narrative thrust doesnt always strike true its unclear how destructive fatal attraction translates on say but letellier has a surer grasp of the basics at which he excels techno thats both thoughtful and primal
when vexd broke up and each member went solo it became clear who was responsible for their aggressive edge the time since those heady dubstep days has reinvented himself as an experimentalist indebted to modern classical his work so far has ranged from live improvisation to dark ambient with a max richter-like melodicism all of it delivered with sci-fi flair those impulses came together beautifully on his last record a 36-minute journey that charted the life cycle of a star from birth to explosive death using the classical sensibilities of his first solo album aftertime with porter takes his music into the avant-garde the music consists of his familiar elements but porter now uses them to disorient surround and overwhelm its an aggressive record in a much different way than the straight bludgeoning of vexd but one that puts his music in an equally visceral context marries the soundsystem influence of porters older work with the symphonic approach of his new solo sound the intention is to eliminate any genre allegiances whatsoever and hes nearly successful: this hefty 53-minute record is rarely easy to follow nor does it toss many recognizable ideas at you stead itll hit you with lightning strikes and then plunge you into eerie calm pushing porters strong melodies further into the background sounds snag and stutter like some immense stuck turbine while new melodic motifs appear and disappear seemingly at random the more epic moments on life cycle of a ive star might have felt huge but they were earned expected here they burst out in sudden eruptions blaring in your face and shaking the ground around you its a trick that starts on the operatically grand opener and then repeats throughout the album in increasingly pulverizing fashion porters less tractable approach means is a bumpy ride but thats what makes it interesting: the quiet passages are more eerie and the loud passages more frightening what lacks in narrative it gains in intrigue its also deceptively percussive from the punishment of and to the lumbering cacophony of porter piles on drums choral vocals strings and other electronic drones in intricate layers which is how he develops his songs this is music that doesnt move from one point to another so much as it slowly spreads outward and then snaps back inward s second half is especially harrowing on sudden blasts of noise rip through the fabric of the recording while chunks of shrapnel fly across the soundstage like faint memories of vexds degenerate this is porter once again finding his way around the impulses and ideas that have fascinated him since the beginning is the most unforgiving album porter has released and its also the one that relates back to vexd the most like that duos records trades emotion for physical power and presence porter has figured out how to channel the aggression of his early material into the maturity and otherworldliness of his solo work and its as breathtaking as it is bruising
with one of s most requested and oft discussed dubplates (up there with there she goes in terms of public demand) the bristol-based producer comes out flying bringing back the power personality and synthesizer heat he stamped on the world with tracks like gully brook lane and snake eater hitting hard with his drum work literally thumps out the kick drums at the same time making sure the snare drums tail gets to exhale out over the swelling frequencies signifying the drop with a typically tongue-in-cheek tom roll lurches into stabs winding tighter and scything quicker at the end of each revolution the whole notion of melody is caked in bass with the occasional glimpse of glitter before the torrential pads of the breakdown and whale song harmonics ensue its a completely explosive and electrifying return for successfully ensuring all ears will be pricked firmly in his direction come album time later this year
relaunched in 2015 after a decade long hiatus jens lowtec kuhns label keeps its original aim of releasing material from those on the fringes its latest is the second in a series of three split releases it pitches lack who first released on the label in 2015 up against the more seasoned the latter leads with a choppy sub 110 pm production probably recorded on the fly its a lot more accessible than the cerebral knottiness of his recent lp disclosure (you might recognise it from the mix accompanying workshops recent label of the month feature ) something about the tracks plucked disco bass sits awkwardly when heard through headphones but the simmering tension of its four note synth refrain grabs you when it washes over a room youre likely to be seduced by lack s in any situation its one of those genre less productions jens kuhn adores evoking vintage jungle spangled footwork and downtempo house at once the way lack shifts the focus between various elements yearning synths distant vocals alien keys highlights the tracks rich detail
a wicked collaboration between swiss producer/dj luciano phillipe quenum (access 58 fame together with partner paul nascimento) initiating the first release of a new label candenza the a-side of the 2-track ep orange mistake kicks off by hurling in a dark rolling bassline eerie enough to send little boys trembling under their beds when one is well-immersed into the beats the crisps rhythmic highs shatters in like a sheet of glass exploding into a million pieces before breaking down into a unexpected yet intoxicating organ theme the rest of track progresses with successive increment of new elements conforming itself within the quirky side of the organ melody making this the perfect track to drop in the middle of the set letting it seep into the minds of the unsuspecting crowd on the flip funky dondy features a twisted minimal number suited for the mangled minds the track is complimented by the sophisticated brittle watery sounds layered with samples of warped spoken vocals the minute yet complex details in funky dondy evident the trademarks of luciano very intelligent production by two brilliant producers couldnt be a better way to kick start a new label
has accomplished a good amount in the three years hes been making atmospheric quasi-dubstep south london producer amassed a sizable collection of high-quality eps and singles on labels like rwina wotnot and project: mooncircle each with its own subtle update or alteration a dip into footwork beats a featured vocalist and yet youd be hard pressed to pick a production out of a lineup as theres little idiosyncrasy in his polished tracks doesnt change this streak though it takes steps toward achieving an identifiable sound key to is its drums which are big crisp and never far off kicks hit like concussion blasts snares and claps smack hard and sharp and in between each pattern crams just about every percussive bell and whistle he can find se beats are sturdy and tenacious especially on and and provide some needed personality amidst the delicate pads and sub-bass drones is s wild card its not necessarily the eps best track but unlike the others the song uses a focused steady techno stomp along with its soft atmospherics coupled with a buzzing bassline hints at unusual ideas for while staying true to the sounds hes worked with for years hed do well to follow that train of thought if only to help him pick a place for his music to go
is alan mathias and etienne dauta two berlin-based frenchmen with strong ties to neuk llns bass cadet record shop (dauta runs the storefront and the duo kicked off its eponymous record label ) their latest lands on local imprint finest hour and it sounds like the work of a production team thats spent a lot of time in the record bins if not for the usual reasons rather than overtly reference classics seem to have internalized the simplicity of so many great dj tools and gone their own way the results are tremendously subtle you might even say dry but inspired nevertheless is pure percussion until about a third of the way through when streaks of dubby melody join the bouncy drums that underpin the track spacious yet driving and detailed to the extreme it sounds like it was produced specifically for fred ps record bag places emphasis on the low-end with sub-bass pulses egging on a steady cymbal tick and waves of ambient melody on the flip ethereality gives way to s tougher side they put a little grit in the bassline and set their drums to a familiar electro stutter for its hardly a heavy cut but it shows mathias and dauta can slam a little when they want to with its ultra-wide pads and syncopated bass is easily the eps most melodic track its gooey major chords though get sliced and diced by a swarm of sharp drum hits might have a light touch but they know how to bite
the third volume of in order to dance r ss rave-themed compilation series from the 90s was packed with cult classics from the likes of human resource second phase n-joi and the prodigy in a way s debut for the label channels some of that bygone spirit and sound gef ge deploys a miscellany of broken beats apollo-esque ambient and backwards-looking techno and yet something is missing the current crop of r s artists all have their own thing going on be it superlative sound design (lakker) technicolored revivalism (lone) or warehouse weaponry (paula temple) with a familiar sentiment and ubiquitous stylistic blend however gef ge has nothing unique about it its not bad per se: bass fiends and jungle heads will enjoy is primed for new-school raves and and will catch ears with their tough percussion and dreamy pads but s two tracks for ilian tape released earlier this year were better sounding like deconstructed drum bass smeared over crunchy wooden rhythms the musics experimental sound design toyed with mood and anticipation artfully on gef ge theres nothing that we havent heard time and again
as a blog astral plane is adept at finding new and exciting names in club music and theyve funneled those impulses into a record label with an equally refreshing perspective with a self-proclaimed mission to push club music into noisier and more abstract territory launched in january with a bang sci-fi-influenced acheron ep by switzerlands shalt clothed experimental club music in gritty textures and saddled it to bucking rhythms now the label returns with another lesser-known producer: from madison wisconsin like acheron is all about texture you might notice in the pits and cracks of the instrumentation on opener the drums are chewed-up things and they trigger the kind of low-end quakes of a classic pan sonic record track veers between serene passages and gauntlets of noise while is pure attack drums seem to forcibly cut through the mix snagging on sounds before they turn into brutally hammering phrases its all a bit frenzied and fragmented like an idm-style take on club music title track sounds regal by comparison pumping up a jersey club bounce with strings and choirs its a strong production on the surface but it feels conservative next to the madness of the other two flanks with two short interludes called susurus first features a warbly piano thats violently interrupted by outbursts of drums while the second finishes the ep with an eerie peacefulness is an uneven often hectic ride but like most of what astral plane touches its never boring
need a box set the same way you need a third pair of trainers n other words you dont buying a box set is mostly an aesthetic choice doubly so when the music is available for download ing that disco fans are almost certainly going to want d a box set documenting m moultons fantastic take on the classic disco sound those unaware m moulton is og he was responsible for the first remix first continuous mix album first 12 inch single and first extended breakbeat modern music might well have been a different beast if he wasnt around many of his extended mixes are load bearing pillars of the disco movement his take on s ssage or peoples s t ny ya wanna are about as good as funky dance music gets new compilation is not the career retrospective you might expect but instead a collection of relatively recent remixes of vintage disco this stage its worth diving into some semantics disco sound was typified but not limited to the output of the philadelphia nternational record label two threads of the sound are a thumping rhythm section originally developed by the legendary bass / drum / guitar section of mfsb and melodically beautiful and lyrically poignant songwriting best of these were penned and produced by revered soul artists such as gambel huff or xter wansel ten disco could communicate either the desperation of heartbreak or the optimism of the aspirational black erican remixes here offer plenty of both often extending fairly short soul records many of which never had a 12 inch mix into epically lush suites res too much music here to detail every track but highlights include s nd t m n and s kful ve se will be well known to most soul heads and theyre presented here in brilliantly extended glory more times than not moulton manages to ride the tricky balancing act of extending the instrumental parts without loosing the essence of the songs perhaps thats something that speaks to his almost unmatched experience dealing with this kind of music rguably the best moments are the less familiar ones tty swans s might have some of the most cutting lyrics in any break up record: t feels good to say told you so / those tears sure look good on you s e brilliantly captures an emotionally precarious lover and her last plea to her former squeeze both would be depressing if they werent backed with such beautifully soaring music is another stand out: a modern house track that was transported back in time with an amazing retro rework first by dimitri paris and vince montana jr later by mr moulton my money its as good as a remix gets m moulton is a living legend and although at times here the standard does dip at their best these remixes are some of the finest disco reworks ever committed to wax

begins with five minutes of wailing ambulance sirens s the kind of urban stage-setting that uk dance music loves the perfect intro for some hard-hitting rhythm to punch through through these five minutes you wait for a beat to drop for jack dunnings recent love affair with techno to manifest itself in a big fat kick drum but instead that siren screams on steadily panning growing unsettling because it wont stop nd then the track dies out and the album claws its way to the next most of your first listen or maybe even your first ten listens of s debut album will be like that: confusing ominous and totally unfriendly londoners work has always been severe but takes it to an almost scary place made in a blitz before a move (home and studio) to hertford its a blackened piece of music that seems to suck in all the light around it indulging in the deepest and darkest impulses of techno genre appears only in shards hidden in the feedback-soaked e or the choppy the latter the determined kick drum sounds like its thumping through water while hissing sounds and dull thuds stand in for chords is made up of implacable noise and unearthly synth sounds and the results are often ugly its the mr hyde to matthew herberts dr jekyll sounds on and are too scorched to place ashen and jagged while sounds like dunning boxing with perc using brass knuckles rriving just three tracks into the album its thats the most striking however this one strangles the comforting throb of dub until its a skanking frankenstein of misshapen loops and harsh cuts equally likely to induce head banging as it is to make you reach for the skip button even after months of sitting with it still feels like a surprise 40 minutes of unrelenting rancour the best aspect of the album is also the worst: its alienating in way that might actually alienate you and keep you from revisiting with another reinvention around the corner dunnings sights are now set firmly on modular synths it looks like will be a cul-de-sac instead of a new direction which makes it all the more strangely alluring e things for sure: for an artist who once self-deprecatingly described himself as just another dubstep producer washing up on technos beach hes definitely not trying to please anyone but himself
when tony williams dropped footcrab back in 2010 he put the juke bug in everyones ear catapulted himself to the forefront of bass music in the process from there he blanketed the scene with uptempo records referencing miami bass electro other niches before finding a home at with the dance mania-worshipping transistor rhythm recent endeavours have shown williams pitch-perfect studio sheen more than any signature style his records since transistor rhythm have been huge rounded polished with spotless synths tidal-wave basslines thats the approach he takes on his second lp the confusingly named despite the title james grieve isnt s chris gaines moment the music here is easily recognizable theres nothing terribly out of character framed as a loving view of his hometown of bristol it features some of the citys best as well as a few of its lesser-knowns like though a competent vocalist her presence on tracks like is perfunctory bl a quality that bleeds into much of james grieve beefier tracks like the buoyant acid of or the jumpy jitter of vibes make the other tunes seem completely unremarkable album jumps from one idea to the next without warning for every exciting moment like the expertly-restrained grime exercise theres an unwelcome pit stop waiting around the corner as usual williams collaborators bring out the best in him shows up for a funky track bursting at the seams with excitable drum breaks chipmunk vocals both appearances by are muscly vibrant though neither one is new: they first appeared on last years bs3 ep williams has always known how to churn out a near-perfect ep but so far long-players have eluded him compare 2012 s adventures in rainbow country to transistor rhythm both sound as if they were birthed from the same sessions but the ep is lean mean where the album gets soft around the middle res an excellent 12-inch (or two) hidden in some of the tracks like are among his best alongside work or i go boom but the rest is a wash a deluge of average tracks padding a few great ones
res a lingering misconception that electronic music is difficult to talk about in a meaningful way discerning specific emotions in a house or techno track can be tough as their expression is often less obvious than say pop or rock are those pads meant to represent happiness or sadness does that chord signify hope or despair but this ambiguity might be one of the best things about techno especially in the genres deeper strands im still trying to figure out the moods on s latest album for as of now i think its the most positive-sounding record ive heard in a long time stacked with bright highly affecting sounds from start to finish s an interesting twist this brand of deep techno is generally considered darker than most other styles and rightfully so thanks to labels like prologue and stroboscopic artefacts and a large crew of alians spread out across a handful of other imprints this is often the case (look to dd l burns alians do darker feature for some context) but not always i know next to nothing about except that he resides in stockholm and makes techno life in sweden is pretty good right could that explain s cheery aesthetic probably not as some of the records released by s stockholm cohorts (abdulla rashim and varg in particular) are about as dark as it gets whatever the reason for its cheerfulness though is exceptional albums flow is flawless beginning with chilled ambient moving into a downtempo drum track and closing with full-blown dance floor techno because of s linear structure its opening third is vital layers of soft spacey samples and gentle melodies entwine for the first 15 minutes pairing with a smoky background hiss that remains omnipresent throughout the album beatless section (comprising and ) features no breaks between tracks even on the vinyl making it a smooth ride from ambience to the more energetic material s traditional techno section probably wouldnt sound as moving without the stellar opening segment each up-tempo cut is fairly straightforward linking simple percussion with metallic club sounds approach is minimal and loopy never jarring or particularly in-your-face save for s most slamming cut comes complete with a jacking broken beat and plenty of reverb on a separate 12-inch it would likely sound completely different the context of the tracklist its a much-needed pick-me-up after a deluge of deep contemplative material well probably never know if meant for to be happy sad or something else ive spent a few weeks with it and ive far from worked it out this is the beauty of well-considered techno
style of daniele baldelli who compiled this mix is a throwback to a moment when it seemed like anything was possible fore the age when genres were rigid and terms like house meant cool (the 80s) a genre (the 90s) or something you cant afford (now) his dj sets knew no boundaries he pitched down disco records as far as they would go and gave birth to the slow chugging balearic sound baldelli was one of the few that felt comfortable mixing early synth experiments into reggae and then going straight into frican music but it worked the late 70s at baia degli ngelis in gabicce taly he was one of the most open minded and respected djs around three decades on he still is concept behind rock is rock sensibilities married to dance music; not dance as its regarded now but instead anything that makes you want to dance ts also a chance for baldelli to show off his passion for crate digging ts unlikely youll have heard of many of the artists here ( and the anyone ) but that doesnt mean you wont love these songs feel is similar to the sleazy analogue sound of optimos mix series a comparison which extends to the incongruous arrangement baldelli happily puts something like the so uplifting it hurts to into troubles in northern reland referencing lo fi ebm of defence not exactly easy bedfellows where baldelli differs from optimo though is his unashamed appetite for having a party youll find no k hole excursions and mind wrong acid trips on rock sure it gets very quirky and downright odd in places but a tune and a vocal is never far away ing the consummate professional baldelli and friend marco dionigi have mixed it all perfectly even if the transitions are a bit short when youre dealing with stuff like harmonicas techno thudding and daft guitar solos though its impressive enough that theyve even made it coherent even when baldelli appears to push things too far it somehow works licia is borderline cheese but in the context of the mix you not only forgive it but get into it rock arrives against a landscape of beardy disco reedits and pilooskis reanimation of nkie vallis ggin and its tempting to see it as being on trend or deliberately modish that would be wrong given baldellis background its surely about simply sourcing damn good music regardless of what/when/where ever its from
its not exactly telling considering the age that we live in that the newest 12 inch from is not a 12 inch at all but it still acts as a nice rhetorical crutch so im going to run with it: if the label didnt think this was good enough to release on vinyl why are they releasing it at all it doesnt help of course that andr and arent exactly part of the labels inner circle but it seems convenient that the first time that the imprint reaches completely outside of itself (no martinez brothers collaboration remixes by dennis ferrer or shared shelter memories to speak of here) it comes up with its first dud a strong word perhaps but andr s is the same sort of cut up vocal groover that the martinez brothers argy turned in earlier this year but without the personality and with plenty of mannheim producers offering the same sort of track at the moment why bother s might be more distinguishable but thats not necessarily a good thing mixing bleep techno and house bounce promises something each time he builds up to a scene clearing wash but fails to deliver anything aside from some mild quivering strings and tinges of orchestral swells all in all rather boring something you couldnt say about anything thats come before from this (usually) exceptional imprint

around 2012 marcus kaye made the leap from drum bass (as marcus intalex) to techno (as ) and he landed with both feet on the ground he quickly appeared on labels like klockworks aus music and the nothing special earning techno bona fides left and right on some level his success boils down to expertise kaye has been making dance music of one kind or another since the mid-90s so he knows how to build a good tune that works for and against him on his hotflush debut as usual these tracks are hard to find fault in but that doesnt mean theyre particularly interesting the a-side has s best moments feels like kayes 2012 klockworks smash forged turned upside-down its got the same rolling riffs but now theyre uplifting like basement techno with a bright disposition the title track layers in minor key pads abstract voices and rustling windchimes la dj sprinkles a bit of wistfulness on an otherwise functional ep the b-side doesnt hold up to closer inspection the skronky basslines of feel antiseptic while the dub-inflected is disappointingly by-the-numbers everything is in the right place and the sound design is top-notch but its such an aerodynamic track that it slips by unnoticed djs will find as reliable as ever but when it comes to sleek modern techno s got more interesting records than this
has churned out some enviably big names like hudson mohawke in the past and at least they want you to believe family member - from edinburgh is next in that lineage is one of the most giddily triumphant hip-hop instrumentals of the year bobby permans sounds are tinnier than some of his contemporaries: his horns sound completely artificial but theyre all the cheerier for it it sounds like everything is made of hollow aluminum yet the tracks cinematic structure breathing-break verses crash land into the dramatic chorus holds a deceptive weight ensi tar also blows things up to theatrical proportions turning the pomp of into a soaring overture while has him adopting a snarling streetwise strut complete with synth guitar he goes all b bravo neo-funk on the surprisingly warm-blooded with its wonky talkbox vocal and twirling synth lines and reprises the magnificent bombast of with the soul-calibre horn blowout the odd one out is which is a by-the-numbers trap instrumental with an aggravating vocal sample and little of the flair of his other tracks thats fine though: is enough to recommend the entire release
klaus heavyweight hill previously one half of the 2sinners crew has been branching out on his own lately with releases coming out on labels like his own 2s2 (home of the autobots crew) rennie pilgrems tcr and the massive ministry of sound is his third release on with his previous two releases earning the man the recognition he deserved side a northern lights northern lights starts its journey sounding like an industrial german techno track with stomping 4 to the floor beats crashing snares and acid squelches during the introduction after the buildup klaus pulls out a heavy bass riff - giving it a notable rock edge with enough oomph to rumble the speakers while adding in some tribal percussion to give it a breaky feel and plenty of vocal stabs its a dark and gruesome cut made for peak time floors and having been witness to hearing it played live by the man himself prompted me to find out what the hell was causing all the commotion side b inside mind the flip side sees klaus taking a deeper trip into nu-skool breaks with inside mind the long introduction is comprised of tight rolling breaks drawn out tech-sweeps right before it takes a sharp turn into the darker side of breaks with a distorted bass line and plenty of crazy tech stabs a quick breakdown settles things down a bit leaving the synths and minimal beats to do the work before things become hectic again with a massive synth melody and hardcore style breakbeats (especially towards the end when the beats go solo - thankyou ill take that and loop it ) unfortunately it felt a little too messy for my liking when compared to the majesty of northern lights

for every music genre revival there seems to be an attendant one that emanates from frica fiends for fuzzy psychedelic sludge can dig zamrock while disco and boogie djs have a wealth of frican material to choose from nd for those who want more synths s forthcoming compilation boogie breakdown: south frican synth-disco 1980-1984 will fit the bill the label teases that release with s a 1983 track that came out around the same time as fellow south frican act brenda the big dudes had a breakout hit with weekend special balls track is much weirder and warped and would be maddening to the would-be trainspotter it inhabits some parallel world between itchy reggae queasy electro slinky disco na f synth pop and proto-house yet never quite settles into any of them considering its ability to tick off that many boxes its no wonder that it has a 300 asking price on discogs on the flip gerd ss edits dont have to do much save for beef up the kick and synth line so that it cuts through the originals lo-fi haze he nudges it just out of its ambiguous sound into something closer to club music resulting in a flash thats just that much brighter
matthew s reactivation of the parts series he started in 1995 has been one of the highlights of 2014 is this years third ep and it will be the final one in the series for now at least a new album is slated for release in early and this ep is yet another reason to look forward to it and to be thankful for him unexpectedly reviving his house-focused guise first thing that strikes you about is what a departure its second track is ing is a simple piano and percussion vehicle for the melancholy guest vocals of ade omotayo who appears on the new kindness record and was a backing singer for amy winehouse its not one of my favourite moments from 2014s parts eps but its an elegantly realised stylistic curveball nonetheless more familiar sounds await elsewhere from the stuttering serrated synth pop of to s submerged techno clatter ends things on a wonky but pretty note with a throbbing rhythmic spine overlain with cascading tinkling melodies ep achieves what it set out to do with characteristic effortlessness
like a teary-eyed efdemin or a soft-spoken pantha du prince german producer christian l ffler harnesses microsamples natural ambience and quiet melancholy in his dance music also like those artists theres usually some extra personality and songcraft that sets l ffler apart from the large swath of ambient techno thats out there that distinction comes from his poignantly simplistic melodies and deft control of open space which offers plenty of across its three tracks lhoste for instance keeps its beat lively and uncluttered despite a number of soft harmonic textures flurries of brittle percussion and recurring vocal refrains the musics barely perceptible exuberance should make for a nice pitstop in a club setting but on record its lack of variety can leave feeling flat when l ffler does kick the energy up a notch on he loses a bit of himself in the process it has been noted a number of times but it bears repeating: the similarities l ffler and pantha du prince share are often uncanny and its never more apparent on than with s marimba samples and gentle bassline the chilly demeanor is a deadringer for a few black noise standouts tempers that familiar sound with tender strings and a stripped-down composition and those small differences are helpful to l ffler
we first encountered back in 2007 when the rlin-based producers pipes n sneakers on compost black label was one of the first bridgeheads in the deep house resurgence which at the time was just starting to shake minimal technos stranglehold on clubland but while his follow-up releases on labels like buzzin fly electric minds and his own might have seemed like part of the reaction against cold mechanistic beats they also suggested hed absorbed something from minimals waste-not-want-not attitude as well as the groove of the 90s house hed more likely been mining for inspiration meticulously produced there was barely a gram of flab to be found melodies were stripped-back vocals and stabs came largely in small cut-up samples and the bare 4/4 rhythms bumped along at a tempo much more suited to slinking than stomping still some of shepheards previous output sounds positively gabber compared to his debut album where rather than picking up the pace he drops it another notch if 12-inches like 2011s fuzzy border were perfect for the warm-up slot or a dawdling 4 am dance floor most of home and garden seems more suited to the sofa at an afterparty true theres a sexy wriggle in the basslines from the off on and has the same slow-burning groove as early mark e productions its music that floats lazily like dawn through the windows subtle and subdued for the most part though there are still echoes of the club in the shuffling beats of sounds like a close cousin of orbitals halcyon on + on presumably one of shepheards influences given that hes previously re-edited the hartnoll brothers monday but even at its most brisk home and garden barely breaks a sweat of course sweat was a crucial ingredient in disco one of shepheards other musical touchstones this time theres no flamboyance and very little fever in shepheards sound home and garden is an impeccably cool and smooth afterhours trip but it could possibly also do with a little more heat
in 2001 over those guys polyrhythmic classic an american poem the poet and politician ras baraka called for an american poem that would traffic not in the language of landscapes and lofty ideals but would instead address the uss true heritage: lynchings mismanaged natural resources labor struggles etc on malik ameer crumpler backed by scott monk on production and leron thomas on trumpet delivers a poem that assesses the state of poetry from a soured perspective ras barakas father amiri baraka is the only poet mentioned by name in where crumpler works in the tradition of poems like black art and against bourgeois art which addressed artists of the white avant-garde who exhibited fragmented bits of nothingness in their work as thomass multi-tracked horn copies the tracks bassline and winds around itself crumplers critique expands to major us literary institutions and those who benefit from them its rendered all the more fiery by a blazing rimshot the record also contains an instrumental version that emphasizes the intricacies of thomass trumpet plus an amerikkkapella that would turn any instrumental into a track for serious reflection monk is given the chance to stretch out on the dub mix where bobbing bass and reverbed piano host a nimble synth melody monk also distills the poets complex thought into a few standout lines whose language is this anyway crumpler asks
re are concept albums and then there are concept albums benjamin wynns fifth lp is a bespoke wooden projector that costs 1000 and plays videos to accompany each track of the self-proclaimed audiovisual record idea was inspired by an obverse box wynn found at a flea market in los angeles which came with letters and other artifacts that told the story of obscure philosopher jackson sonnanfeld-arden and his estranged grandson henry jackson arden his time sonnanfeld-arden grew obsessed with his unification theory surrounding what he saw as the worlds nine pure tones se nine tones were said to be in perfect harmony until they were misaligned during big bang and now much of modern life is an attempt to find this harmony once again to sonnanfeld-arden this obverse box of mysterious origins and its projections of happy memories was a way to recapture that long-lost harmony and he grew obsessed with it in his old age whole family in fact was deeply affected by the box as it was passed down from generation to generation before it fell out of their hands and into the flea market where wynn found it is inspired as much by sonnanfeld-ardens theory as it is by his story s meant to be listened to with visual accompaniments even if you dont splurge on the obverse box the albums website has a treasure trove of old photos from wynn and his musician friends to tug at your heartstrings but while these extras provide some neat context the album doesnt really need them is affecting enough on its own with swathes of grand and gothic melodies lit only by a faint pilot light like a vague memory you cant quite make out ghostly hum of and the fuzzy distortion of are shrouded in a mournful fog wynn wrings a lot out of small gestures and movements a talent likely learned from his time as a tv and film composer you can hear it in his subtle strokes like the quiet bass stabs in or the careful drums in which swim with fluid grace an unusual choice for las friends of friends wynns lp stands out like a sore thumb amidst the music of shlohmo and groundislava but its a risk that largely pays off not having experienced the albums film projector myself i cant speak to that aspect of the release but on purely musical terms wynn boils down some heavy themes and complex ideas into uncomplicated ambient compositions with an eno-esque directness and if you take the time to explore s backstory it becomes all the more haunting
say all you want about those [a:rpia:r] boys: to these ears belonged to another romanian phenom bogdan barea started off the year releasing on the trios homespun label and finished it with half of an innervisions ep and a number of lomidhigh credits to his name astroceva is the first of two lmh organic releases to see the light of the day in as many months and its a relentless banger of a release full of the patchwork house music that has become his trademark sets the scene about as well as anything here the track seemingly begins in mid-sentence as if weve merely come upon the tune a few minutes into its gestation bareas work sounds like it needs a few more coats of primer the drums are almost too present a bassline clearly played from a guitarist impatient to get out of the studio and back to his normal gig its not grit exactly because these are highly ordered compositions that march stiffly in lock-step and only approach funkiness because of their repetition but you get the sense that these arent presets either (that or he covers up their use well ) and are the highlights with the former warping a stumbling break into a 4/4 template doesnt sound right but barea wills the track to meet the genres form the tracks on astroceva sound like hard work as though barea is standing behind these children with mussed-up hair and chocolate on their faces that cant stand still and is trying to get them to (at least) stand up straight he doesnt quite succeed but that wobbliness that results is exactly the point while nothing here quite approaches petre inspirescus sakadat seems capable of a similar scene-defying moment one to watch
is one those producers that seems to be learning as he goes: the dane is refining and developing his sound with each well-chosen release and fitting quite comfortably into the likeable trenton stable - is another step in the right direction its not going to blow your mind but thats not the point is it begins well with a clipped melodic synth riff and a fat house kick before a quick drop introduces the smorgasbord elements that keep your feet tapping for seven minutes: a prodded bassline breathy vocal spiraling riffs and course the requisite blips bloops and bleeps this melodic post-minimal houser swings along quite nicely thanks to the intermittent hi-hat action and zox has an ability to balance the various samples stabs and fx that make up the core the track without things sounding too cluttered but it still lacks a certain something a confidence and a clarity that could make it great less can be more tucked away on the b-side is the real gem: its a subtle serving that follows a similar path to the a-side but is better observed the distinctive nagging riff makes for tense beginning shored up by a dry snare and housey bottom-end before zox pulls it down a gear with late night chords and a more gentle approach to adding the all-important ingredients the hyperactive closes proceedings with a jolt rocking the same sort melodic/melancholic house but with a rougher bassline and abrasive percussion
chicago s has put together a smashing track for kompute s 12th release this package comes with a remix from soultek and also grayarea on the flip the original mix starts off with a minimal beat pulsating stabs and a distant repeating vocal sample that slowly filters to the front of the mix fx ed percussive elements then swirl around as a grungy synth is introduced as the track continues a spooky melodic riff is added before the beat momentarily drops and then re-enters maintaining the pace and energy throughout next up is the soultek remix this version is filled with panned swoosh effects a funky analog bass and tough dirty synth sounds the vocal samples are processed to give them a very cool stuttering electro feel which works really well in the mix finally grayarea take things into broken beat territory with their remix this mix has a huge rolling nu skool bassline blazing techno percussion acid synths and gyrating riffs eventually a vocoded vocal is brought in with a bleepy melody that continues till the finish this is a sensational release from kompute that spans through electro breaks techno and house territory - an absolute must full marks
chances are if you know at all its from his kinda-electro kinda-disco kinda-indie-rock band whomadewho most recently seen on kompakt but the danish producer recently made a move to los angeles where he found himself in contact with boss leeor brown have previously released the depressive hip-hop of shlohmo and the anything-goes pastiche of salva but also barfods debut solo album is the most explicitly house thing the label has put out yet in typical fashion its not very typical theres a liveliness and vivacity to that links up with label mate shlohmos pastoral murmurings and ernest gonzales still life portraits these arent tracks made with drum machines and old synths (not entirely anyway) they sound as if theyre built out of sticks and rubber like the toy store percussion on st or the lolling mallet riff on its a house (or maybe techno) album in spirit you wouldnt mistake the chugging arpeggiated bassline or strobelight drumming in storming opener d s o y for anything else nor the labourious disco stomp of but its also so many other things favouring climactic build ( ) over a steady pulse or a good vocal melody over a repetitive chord progression perhaps reflecting his tenure in a bona fide rock band features genuine pop songs and not mere token attempts the stuff of persistent and virulent earworms swedish singer steals the show sweetening the bumpy ride of and layering euphoria on a dangerously infectious ascent with the latter rises and rises on that same tactile percussion as st propped up by glistening rays of sunlight while s vocals are inflated with reverb its a completely unabashed reach for pure musical bliss that shouldnt work as well as it does just as the theatrical string breakdown in dont would be overcooked and melodramatic in anyone elses hands the other thing has over other dance albums is its elegant pacing; ebbing wisely between human vocal and programmed rigidity theres an effortlessness to the affair whether its when the speedy opener spills over into the woozy sun-burned stumble of or the roller-coaster ride through the albums hallucinatory ending run of and one rushing-rapid of liquid synth after another feels engineered for eminent listenability
on his debut for the sister label of ostgut ton delivers a four-track ep of accomplished if dour techno pairs stoic kicks with insistent claps and a menacing synth line the percussion and synth ebbing in and out so that each element is at some point exposed and gleaming is less stark its muscular kicks offset by chord stabs that add a dash of welcome colour to an otherwise monochrome ep may be a no-nonsense four-to-the-floor track but its subtly ranging dynamics and brisk snares give it a fluid kinetic quality that energy is short-lived though and the eps b-side closes with the murky ambient-techno track massive lonely kicks resonate powerfully with chilly gusts billowing throughout the tracks yawning spaces is a perfectly fine producer but the humourless restraint of - ----- will mean that outside very specific circles it will be nobodys favourite
many people will tell you freerotation is more than just a festival to some of its most passionate regulars its a family and for a number of artists its a big break steevio and suzybee the duo behind the festival always manage to fit a few up-and-comers onto the lineup which is a pretty big deal given how respected the gig is and how little the bill changes each year the latest such artist is an irish producer based in london whos played freerotation the last two years in a row now the festivals label is releasing his first ep has freerotation written all over it from its misty forest atmosphere to its stuttering rhythms which like the festival itself tap into a heady blend of deep house techno and uk bass in a way it sounds like a debut: and all feel like different angles on the same idea which starts to grow thin three tracks in still its confident inspired stuff especially in terms of rhythm each groove has an odd distinctive swing and all of them are catchy and expressive especially the seasick motion of the timbres are vivid as well offsetting ultra-smooth kicks and basslines with woody organic sounds shows that still has room to grow but gives every reason to think he will
if you go to electronic music shows in vancouver chances are youll have at least heard of one of the citys best-kept secrets in the form of a bass-wise hip-hop/g-funk synth wizard with one hell of a live set part of the secrecy is by design: he hasnt had a proper release in seven years vancouver music magnate max ulis new label wisely chooses for its first release and shows why michael campitelli has such a renowned reputation in the city oscillates on a viscous and sludgy groove handclaps lining up with the kick drum so every heavily-swung boom feels like a thunderclap its druggy hip-hop rendered even more sluggish with a remix from fellow canadian xi whose version actually ups the tempo while somehow making the record sound as if it were playing at 16 rpm the result is like his earlier garage work on downers that delayed-thunderclap effect turned into a frighteningly disorienting gauntlet as pitched-down synths shoot out like steam bursting through pipes with its skronky shuffle and clattering percussion aint bears resemblance to fellow bcer monolithiums dubstep-infused hip-hop on last years simon g-funk ep but the eps best track actually steers away from all that top-heavy hip-hop swagger spends its first minute wading through pools of reverb with sun-kissed guitars and welcoming strings before plummeting into slow-motion dub techno it showcases what really sets apart: an effortless knack for space you wont find in many other instrumental hip-hop producers
lvs si williams and will horrocks are natural collaborators the uk duos rhythms hold up each guest artist like scaffolding it usually feels like theyre providing structure rather than content the approach has resulted in two stellar albums with joshua idehen and the kwaito-inspired sebenza with a cast of south african artists ancient mechanisms too is largely inspired by an outside musician in this case armenian pianist williams and horrocks were first introduced to by gilles peterson in 2012 who encouraged them to work together for a bbc radio session (he later gave them an award for it) this inspired lv to further explore the piano and discover the possibilities of acoustic instrumentation the result is an album thats unusually baroque for brownswood one that sees lv in completely unfamiliar waters and struggling to stay afloat ancient mechanisms is roughly split between lvs own piano explorations and their collaborations with the five collaborations vary in quality though williams and horrocks rarely mesh with s virtuosic piano playing sometimes as on and dazzles with his fingers and the duo seem unsure how to react they either saddle s piano with a blas jazz beat or dropping hesitant percussive sounds here and there as if afraid to rock the boat its when the pair move past their habits that the collaborating works closes the album with a stirring weightless ballad featuring s vocals the equally floaty is the albums clear highlight though the piano is almost nowhere to be heard instead its mostly ambient full of heavily manipulated sounds and strange melodic ideas more like a piano abstraction than a straight recording that last idea defines the rest of ancient mechanisms where the duo sometimes sound like theyre picking apart a piano to see what noise they can make with its inner workings you can almost hear them quizzically examining the instrument on which starts out abstract and moves into generic prettiness until a broken beat takes it somewhere vaguely interesting then there are moments like and dansearstraat which are basically chilled-out versions of typical lv tracks though its concept and the collaboration behind it is rather ambitious ancient mechanisms is ultimately inconsequential williams and horrocks never gel with as tightly as they have with past collaborators and having his much busier performances sprinkled among the duos experiments only makes the album more disjointed still ancient mechanisms deserves credit for trying new things even if those things never manage to get off the ground
s barrelling techno is cool and all but i prefer it when he lets the light in luckily for me his new ep for kerri chandlers oozes good vibes with tribal beats sunny melodies and that special groove its tough to pick a favourite from these four tunes but im going with a dubby shuffler that sounds like a day at the park with sheds wax project catchy micro-stabs combine with tough bassline for a sweet six minutes of rolling bliss capped off by breathy vocal snippets that give the track a psychedelic touch without detracting from the cheery mood the kind of tune you might hear margaret dygas play when things start to get freaky at a day party couldve been one of the tracks of the summer if it werent for its late august release is less organic but it also comes with plenty of feeling a looped bass synth bleeps while the energy picks up with the patient introduction of hi-hats a pad and at the sweet spot one-third through a satisfying clap these elements come and go throughout the rest of the tune shifting the energy and mood with each subtle change the beatless catches at another sentimental moment leaving a 909 workout as the only track free of melody but for anyone craving tender sounds theres enough of them elsewhere
if you were worried that was getting too poppy rest assured stepping away from 2011s the look and nother girl and much further from this years radio-ready concealer canadas foremost purveyor of vocal-y garage-y goodness heads back to the clubs with his first record for sure there are girly vocals in but they tinge rather than saturate matched as it is with fat convulsing synths the beat is also rather stomping most of all however its the tracks barely-relenting drive that will galvanise dance floors; just a brief breakdown provides relief from greenes constant pushing and seem more in character recalling tell me the former is well-served by a rolling arp cresting to a blissed-out peak where feminine crooning and fairly vanilla 303 join the fray wielding fog-like vocal slivers with considerable skill the latter is bolstered by a blobby-sounding low-end and more bright synthesis despite strongly resembling his previous tracks these final two cuts are a healthy reminder that greenes talents lay in pop and club hybrids ut as shows hes not too bad at simply moving feet either

as someone who distrusts underground purism have to admit are deeply intriguing group runs the label which gives them unimpeachable detroit credentials and yet their own productions are best categorized as pop techno don t mean that as a criticism: popular dance music is in many ways the purest form of dance music only thing that matters in pop dance clubs is whether the music is enjoyable and danceable (no one cares who made it what label it s on or various types of stylistic nit-picking) and neither do mean that it sounds like benny benassi its pop techno in the same sense as nner city or mad mike s work for members of the house s biggest hit is 2000s black water a record which was big in both underground and commercial scenes a sure sign of quality if ever there was one is no black water : it lacks that killer hook however it does have a similar combination of elephantine kick drums bags of melody and a densely packed groove overlaid with a blatantly commercial vocal pop side is in that dense groove there s no sense of sparseness here and of course in the vocal techno side on the other hand is displayed not just in the heaviness of the drums but in the delicate interplay between the different sounds on display are the groups high-tech jazz chops as they take a basic structure and create infinite variations upon it throughout more importantly though it s danceable unite all of the elements here to create a single undulating groove there s no sense of here s the drums and here s the bassline its simply here s the track also has the much harder-edged the a furious loopy techno workout free of any melody at all t s forceful well-produced and guess banging but isn t a sound that finds too much favour these days having said that in the hands of a robert hood or a ben sims ve no doubt it ll do its job well
flick through the rails at urban outfitters and youll probably find t-shirts on sale but youre just as likely to hear their dark gothic electronica oozing from the shops speakers danny roddle and vocalist emilie lbisser started in music before branching out into fashion their latest ep of ethereal late-night melancholia has already received support from perc photonz daniel very and james holden you can imagine holden massaging nthem into one of his eclectic witching-hour sets it wraps an arpeggiated motif like the one from frankie knuckles your love in gauze then dresses it with a sad synth drone and a dull bass throb then its gone far too early maintains a sense of foreboding but this time with lbissers vocals brought to the fore a bewitching lament to a backdrop of martial snares and trance-inducing electro pulse pds name-check the cocteau twins and velvet underground as influences but theres more than a hint of this mortal coils song to the siren here it would be a brave but devastating addition to any early-hours dance floor
get on board kids curtis train is leaving and we dont want to have to leave you behind it may be by simple virtue of the source material but curtis remix of s has me believing that we may have yet another auteur on our hands how else to explain the weirdness with which his remix goes about its business things are fine for nearly two minutes mood building they call it but then horns cheesy midi sounding horns trumpeting away as if they were worthy of the pomp that theyre pumping out its a dj koze moment of disruption and it doesnt stop there as curtis settles into a groove and lets you bask in the glory of smooth synth beds further syn trumpet warble and maybe even a timpani or two stupid in the best sense re are other tracks here including s original which contains enough of curtis detritus that you wonder how much of his remix is genius and how much of it is warped source material but takes a relatively straight tack with it making the whole thing a bit of a bore to get through migren who offers up further another remix however splits the difference and goes for productive hypnosis he succeeds rolling dub clouds and chain link melodies into a solid rework why youd listen to it over curtis take i have no idea but stranger things have happened

for an album called -aquarium s third long-player sounds remarkably like its still under water the fourteen tracks have a submerged sound that wibbles squelches and nods along with a slightly stoned smile never getting much above 90bpm if youre into the inevitable comparisons then youd probably liken aka kel mckeown to a mixture of four tet dj cam dj shadow and boards of canada electronic slightly folksy hip hop theres no massive spread of influences like flying lotus but -aquarium is a likeable if slightly limited friendly little world where trees talk its always summer and the closest you come to harm is talking to a fish is where you see what can really do a neck cracking beat opens up into a satisfying drone of a bassline thats augmented by seagulls stuttering drums and delicate guitar lines builds up before all the elements come together in the final minute of intense slow grandeur that as its the second track really builds your expectations nothing else alas lives up to it the album sags with too many songs that in a rare moment of inspiration my housemate described as waking up music especially towards the end -aquarium strays into the same territory as nightmares on wax circa smoker s delight great if you have a spliff in your hand underdeveloped if you haven t perhaps should try something different: when he does the results are great like the deranged insistence of his only dancefloor-aimed track indeed s music is arguably at its most lovable in its most eccentric moments: could be an unused skit outtake from mr scruffs keep it unreal right down to the daft spoken-word dialogue about plants pondweeds water weeds and that perennial obsession of se or scruff fish
for his 2016 book the : a zen journey through the christian afterlife david solomon examined 5 000 accounts of near-death experiences (ndes) for insights about what happens when we pass over to the other side there are comparisons to be drawn with s own efforts to revive pieces from his archive of dat tapes (the ep is the latest in a series of archival releases from the german veteran ) but perhaps just as applicable is the books subtitle solomon an american christian minister spent 15 years apprenticing to the mystic paul solomon who combined pan-global spirituality with baptist teachings friedman likewise draws on global knowledge to loosen up western tradition above all in the realm of rhythm is defined by those rhythms: hypnotic 11- or 15-beat loops played on elegant live-sounding drums confounding to 4/4-attuned ears but also graceful and natural-feeling on the opener rhythms are deployed playfully while its staccato synths hint at digidub and its organ licks give a whiff of the blues the rest of the ep is harder to pin down its sounds oblique and its moods ambiguous even by friedmans stony-faced standards is a teasing dust cloud of pitter-patter drums delicate synth and wafting pads the head-nodding stumbles between different swing settings while shimmering wurlitzer chords whisper jazz fusion s guitar swoons suggest an affinity with the uncanny vistas of 90s post-rock the intensity jumps with whose straighter triplet groove seems headed for a climax (the title the name of a sea snail with an extraordinary twisting shell means spiral staircase in dutch) but after a couple of minutes the track dissolves back into the gloom and friedman plays us out with a mirage of gongs and other percussion caught between this world and the next
belfasts jack hamill ought to be riding high after the release of his hugely ambitious debut lp-cum-space opera welcome to mikrosector-50 in many ways it was the culmination of hamills aesthetic: a narrative-driven tongue-in-cheek approach that takes in oily synth-funk frenzied drexciyan electro cosmic house and plenty else besides this the first in a new series of releases sees him return to for the first time since 2010s journey to the core the unknown sphere correlation 1 is more stylistically narrow than its predecessor all of the tracks here cleave to a soft-edged house template (save for the exquisite new age synth drift of closer ) but as we might have expected from hamill this is house music for martian terraces: rich bright strange and luxurious and malaysia are the highlights gorgeous pastel-shaded jams led by their lissome g-funk melodies and dextrous chord work is fractionally sterner though it ascends to a stately peak over its six minutes if we had to lose one it would be the fittingly titled which less strikingly covers similar ground to its companions these tracks smooth tuneful gracefully uncoiling are close relatives of floating points shadows ep and like floating points their chief weakness is that they are perhaps too slickly executed then again when the squiggly melody bursts through in the closing minutes of malaysia you might think that thats not a weakness at all

the canny devils at warp bring nicolas together with two of their best known artists for a special record store day outing this 1 inch shows the chilean artist reducing rian s from its original 45 minutes into eight minutes of augmented quiet for the first minute or so you have to strain to hear if the record is even playing ut rather than some john cage homage it gradually unfurls like a time lapse film of a blossoming sunflower piano notes are scattered sparingly a slither of an ethereal vocal unwinds slowly its a reverential rather than radical remix more interesting is s take on arty alt rockers from last years shields is transformed into deep burnt ultra slo mo house with the addition of piano heavily treated guitar loops and distorted bass it demands repeated plays to fully grasp its many nuances but it may be one of the best pieces of music has put his name to
s metamorphosis from primary school teacher to kanye west collaborator has been swift and stunning the 24-year-old who first came to prominence with 2011s druggy kings and them mixtape received an email last year requesting his services as a collaborator on wests yeezus lp he produced album track im in it and later signed a publishing deal with wests g o o d music putting his teaching career on hold for a bit is his first release since the eps standout is a crashing amalgam of beauty and brutalism with steel-clad percussion and synths mercilessly punching holes in an ethereal background opener is an aggressive icy blend of tormented synths and vocals and dysfunctional bass while propellor and match squalling synths with deliciously grinding percussion reminiscent in places of pan sonics blocky brutality burials sudden atmosphere shifts and vatican shadows abrasive beauty is as brightly promising as it is stark and cold
as a solo artist and half of unknot prefers chunky stout sounds in spite of that his brand of techno is detail-oriented; every little element is highlighted in bold mysterious love the italian producers 2014 debut on ilian tape was promising but is what really sets him apart released on the record is the labels strongest release since xosars let go a collection of fluid techno draped in gorgeous colours and textures the skeletons of s tracks always feel like theyre submerged in something from the early morning mist of opener to the the gooey viscosity of to the earthier where a gritty bassline scatters over the canvas like digital dirt his tunes are rarely as simple as they first seem changing and evolving over their runtimes: introduces squiggly idm synths while isolates its dulcet chimes for a stunning breakdown on shows that he can also finesse his formula into something tough he keeps his heady concoction just below a boil crafting the kind of pressurized thump that would turn your techno dungeon of choice that much sweatier is wonderfully balanced tinkering with its functional and dynamic formula to make all four tracks interesting on their own every tune is loaded with ear candy and enough shifts and transformations to hold up in any setting this is a big leap from s last ep and a path towards the wilder frontiers of his unknot project
returns in typically off beat fashion sidestepping once more to find a new stylistic angle is not an extrovert even upbeat track but with it s hypnotic falling bassline and refrain it lingers long in the memory a whole host of remixes are headed by a subtle take from royksopp and some perfectly serviceable versions from jammer and soft pink truth it s all about the original though and returning to it again shows just how much has to say pretty much essential listening
in recent years pittsburgh pennsylvanias has been just about the only us artist to release on is the third vinyl ep on the label for (he had also put out a few digital-only releases including two long-players) and its easy to see how hes earned label boss dam xs approval this is techno for dark and claustrophobic moments opening the record is the seven-and-a-half minute-long which gallops at a frantic 4/4 clip past long droning walls of sound and perhaps sheds a few less serious listeners along the way while lets loose with a barrage of blurted science-fiction noises most captivating is the heavily syncopated with all its detailed percussive tumbles but if you crave some sort of melody hold on to until the last track into a that one is anchored by a moody lead riff covered with more of the otherworldly sighs and moans that mark much of s work and pitched a few bpms lower than the rest of the record making for an eerily calm sort of come-down
more quirky jazz-dipped house with a side order of disco from canadas guillaume coutu-dumont smoky sax motifs and a screaming hammond meander across sparkles in the iridescent glow of a glitterball but also manages to channel 40s swing psych rock and even some klezmer doors vibe of the previous track filters through to but its a moodier tone thats captured here achieved through gusts of airy synths and trippy headfuck vocals the intense tenor of the track only punctured by a fleeting live drum solo at over ten minutes long the sprawling somehow manages to tether security alarm throbs and pub pianos to a jaunty ragga bassline and make it work s epic assembly calls to mind dj kozes recent work in its evocation of a twisted dance floor

solo albums like orndom and phillips paint phillip as a lovesick softie for melodic house but his other outlets such as the tuff city kids duo with gerd janson prove hes always game for a little hedonism which is the side he taps into on this futureboogie two-tracker a record laced with as much kinetic dance floor energy as 80s-inspired synths neither or are surprising in how they play out but s tuneful sensibilities and way with momentum keep them engaging picking a favorite from the two seems pointless as both sides do solid work with a handful of similar ideas the -side title track could be called the anthem a skybound roller driven by one big bassline while keeps things playful and funky on the flip with an enviable arsenal of gear at his disposal is liberal with the amount of synths and percussion he weaves into the tracks still careful to give each one a distinct flavor ut if pressed to choose is the pick if only for its sheer melodic variety and rhythmic potency if used at the right time will give your set a spring-loaded launchpad but its the -side thats sure to keep everybody moving

fter a slight delay irelands first dubstep label [naked lunch] returns to deliver another statement of intent with their second release a split 10 inch between and while both artists are equally at home in the world of drum bass or dubstep the imprint seems to be digging for a wide angle on the latter taking in both a classic ristol sound and the new dutch and erlin influenced school of techno dubstep hybrids this should be no surprise considering the label was conceived in rotterdam and is based only a relative stones throw from uk dubsteps south west epicentre k james oyle has already appeared on the label roughing up trgs generation late last year and here he kicks things off with a percussive heavy piece reminiscent of cyrus pinpoint snares and heavy kick drums battle it out over slowly bleeding atmospheres spooky shimmering melody lines and seriously low end bass wobbles to perfectly capture the mood of its title: things are far less pensive on the second side where put their foot on the pedal and launch into a 130 pm tribal workout whereas is perfect for opening up some space in a set is good for hunting it down the rolling drum lines come across like an impatient claustrophobic lood on my hands with hawkish dub atmospheres and a steely sense of enforcement reminiscent of frances excellent 7even recordings label driving rolling and frighteningly cocksure
despite their shared patronage by l i e s steve summers ( k jason kiewicz) and bookworms ( k nik dawson) dont seem like natural partners the former is a prolific no-nonsense purveyor of twisted throwbacks while dawson has so far offered house in the form of corroded percussive psychedelia theyre somewhat similar but hardly the sort of duo one would expect to make a record this otherworldly the debut for kiewiczs label sense of psychedelia is present each track unfolds with a kind of loose dreamlike logic but the producers dance floor instincts are toned down and the results reach into almost ambient territory on for example arching chords and percolating acidic synths nearly swamp the brittle tapping drums; s silvery gusts form a pristinely sparkling counterpart to its anemic rattle nd drifts off on a placid bassline which lazily nudges the warbling synthetics forward caked in sleep
taken from balance 007 comes with another batch of four tracks that featured on chris fortiers mix fade records artist royal sapien kicks off the a side with his take of funk harmony park - my truth this track has had a number of remixes done the most notable came from the new yorker who has turned the smooth groove of the original into a jacked up concoction of heavy broken beats and constantly moving melodies that create a mystical quality conners and klinger utilise the vocals of fay sephirah for usage creating long delays that glide over busy percussion altering the mood with squelchy basslines and filtery uplifting pads that push it deeper in a pleasing way what started out as gentle vocal number continuously develops a peakier edge till the end the reverse side of of has the essence of what fortiers mix was about with the falling deep mix of it hits my hair from error error its probably one of the more interesting tracks from 007 with nothing but a pure tech swing to it steeped in chunky slabs of claps and snare rolls that carve out rhythms while gurgling tweaked synth sounds beckon us not to listen more but to start moving its deep as hell so be warned ;) rounding up this package is t/he slow eerie sound of cooling the plasma from rene breitbarth simple yet effective rumbling beats along with a gradual introduction of glassy synths work their way underneath throughout theres whispering vocals underneath that drop out near the end and picking up the pace with a more rhythmic flow chris fortier pushed things that little bit further with balance 007 and should be listened to as a whole creating a new sound in itself by re-editing and cutting up tracks spread over 3 cds its a completely interesting and educational experience
the sixth record from lets loose what people have no doubt been waiting a long time for one of its two cuts appeared way back in june but has just now been pressed to wax by the gothenburg-based label its an interesting bit of work shaping old and new sounds into an ebullient slice of house the tracks bedrock is classic roland fare: taut kicks bouncing toms and nimble claps ll the other parts that is to say the melodic parts sound shiny and modern who co-own niara use this contrast to great advantage unleashing masses of fluttering synths over the spectrum theres always a lot going on but the tracks careful sense of balance ensures nothing ever feels arbitrary or cloying if there wasnt already a lurking suspicion that the duo have a rather cheeky attitude towards retro then the flipside should confirm it it has a big alearic breakdown thats reminiscent of orbital underworld and a great many other acts from that era its hard to pinpoint exactly how it hits this feeling perhaps with its faded breakbeat or maybe its slightly kitsch tap-tapping bassline whatever the case rather cleverly show that nostalgia can be induced sans obvious trope-borrowing nd more importantly theyve created a track with the potential to bring contemporary dance floors to their knees at the end of a night
following on from marquis hawkes debut ep glaswegian imprint open their account by hosting another enigmatic first timer as of now all we know about is that hes french and enjoys making trippy thought-provoking beats begins things confidently with marrying swanky low-slung bass with a palette of broad leaden synths at 115 bpm the result manages to come across as both sensitive and darkly groovy at first feels like the formers slightly more subdued older brother with muted 303s grumbling away alongside a barely discernible bassline something clearly gets under his skin however as mellow acidity begins to bubble and spiral out of control so shrill is it in parts that it proves difficult if not uninteresting to listen to is even more demanding fusing perforating stabs with a mountain range of 303s it sounds at best like a slice of acid polka and at worst like slightly cheap european tech house edinburghs fudge rescues the release with his sprawling atmospheric take on sharpening the pace enables to unravel the tracks infectious bass and synth combo in all its rich soulful glory making this and the original worth the price tag alone
no matter how many times you look at it guy gerber and sean p diddy combs remains a curious pairing combs is a three-time grammy winner and ( until recently ) the richest man in hip-hop carrying all the complicated baggage that comes with being a superstar gerber is a tech house producer and freewheeling playboy who made the centerpiece of his pacha residency last year a 150 000 glove combs has a long-standing interest in dance music hes been spotted in the booth at dc-10 and on the dance floor in miami and in 2009 he appeared on a playful (and very much of-its-time) collaboration with dj hell his affiliation with gerber began when he used one of the sraelis tracks in his last train to paris album released in 2010 under the name diddy dirty money this proved the catalyst to a studio partnership and a collaboration has been in the works for at least three years gerber said the album was finished back in 2011 one tune slipped out a couple of years back then everything remained quiet until the release of t last month now the full album has been released as a free download positions itself as a headsy afterhours record the result however feels glossy but short on inspiration there are no curveballs and rarely is there a feeling of two creative minds teasing out a middle ground between their respective sounds too often is emotionally overcooked see the cloying synths on opener or the grandiose beatless intro to combss vocal turn on ( you gotta believe in something / believe in her / you think m talkin about a woman / m talking about d or a higher being ) rubs awkwardly against gerbers horns and arpeggios sounds like a pitched-down (and forgettable) trance record while tracks like and ndian simply go on for too long gerber does pull a couple of strong productions out of the bag the snares on create a feeling thats slinky yet propulsive and the eastern riff on worms its way through the gaps in the bassline but beyond those two its only the previously released tracks and t that display the kind of swagger youd expect from such larger-than-life personalities listening to combss words about the record being something new and one long journey one long emotion smack of empty rhetoric not all odd couples enjoy happy relationships and this unlikely duo have served up an album thats limp and forgettable

few techno producers have as distinct a sound as the ukrainian artist keeps his tracks fast and lean working with skewed melodies and rarely abating drums to create moments of agitation and brittle beauty that feel like they could go on without end having been at it for around a decade now tolkachevs international profile has risen with recent releases on the likes of fullpanda geophone and m_rec ltd his second solo 12-inch on semantica contains four diverse tracks that reinforce his status as one of the scenes most compelling talents which glides across ten-beat measures is a sublime start its lengthy drum sequence treading through a constellation of gorgeously glimmering bleeps and contemplative synth motifs its one of tolkachevs mellowest tracks and id say one of his best dials up the intensity sure to set alight peak-time dance floors it packs bristling stomping percussion and an angular echo-laden lead that seems to fire off tracers as it ricochets downward on the flip are two more straightforward stripped-back cuts employs a single kick drum and some increasingly amplified plucks and synth squelches which drift alone across a long dizzying drop mid-way through where a fuzzy mass of organ chords covers a soft kick is tranquil but disconsolate a melancholy end to another excellent effort from tolkachev
is a sequel of sorts to last years medium ep which saw s paul purgas and james ginzburg relocate to woodchester mansion in the cotswolds after setting up a large sound system they pushed noise at high volume through the buildings structure and recorded its responses: high frequency shrieks and chatters that rattled up stairwells and echoed down empty corridors sub bass detonations that rumbled through the walls and floors contains three short recordings made using the same methodology in a series of different spaces: s concrete bunker a nuclear power station in and mine in all three are fascinating and detailed listens especially when played through decent speakers which make it possible to detect the subtle differences between the three locations s metal staircases hum and buzz quietly in the background while sub bass pulses abruptly cut out to leave long trails of echo rippling sharply outward through its cavernous interior the reverberations that rumble through mine in contrast are soft and pillowy hinting towards the dulling properties of rock and earth the recording at is the strongest of the three and packs a real emotional punch the power station itself is now decommissioned and will remain standing empty until 2083 appropriately the echoes that rattle through the recording are harsh chilly and sinister painting a portrait of a space now devoid of human activity the result is a subtle but powerful meditation on humanitys ability to inflict profoundly disruptive effects on our environment
this next release on convert is quite an interesting one as it sees a dj from central america put his talents to the test quite a hit in the panama area in central america this man under his guise delivers two very chunky house cuts here first up is dirty a track that very much lives up to its title deep chunky beats meet a throbbing baseline all while acid riffs give the track a gritty tough edge dark vocal stabs combine with percussive elements to build the track up throughout and as such it is quite a quirky yet very much a chunky production full of full and devastating beats almost there on the flip is just as threatening as the a-side again the beats are very heavy and these beats combine well with the percussion in the track a deep subtle baseline roars in the background giving the track a solid funk to it while electric stabs keeps the track in a constant flow this is definitely some tough peak time progressive a very good release here out of panama with both sides not messing around two good tough tracks that both have a good flow and groove to them as well as some very good production
s music is challenging not in the sense that its esoteric but in the sense that its twisted rhythms offer an actual challenge to dancers in its original context footwork music is made to push the limits of its associated dance to be played in the circle at a community center or school gymnasium in chicago where it will literally keep people on their feet the faster and more syncopated the music the more of a challenge it presents to the dancer who must keep within the groove and respond to musical cues until his or her opponent misses a step or passes out from exhaustion a veteran dancer himself knows that its his job to push legs to the limit without allowing his rhythms to splinter into total chaos at which point he would lose his audience documentarian wills glasspiegel once pointed out that s hypnotic vocal loops taunts and threats like motherfuck your favorite dj that often stretch from a tracks head to tail produce an effect not unlike steve reichs tape recorder experiments its gonna rain or come out the way we perceive a familiar sound changes as it loops over and over; it starts to lose its original sense while accumulating new dimensions and warped contours glasspeigel called it a battle trance a state of heightened focus that contorts the flow of time and leaves dancers attuned to subtle shifts and tensions part of what makes boos beats so arresting then is a tension between this trance tendency and the erratic elements of his music: sudden outbursts of opera singing cacophonous drum machine explosions aggressive interjections about stealing your girlfriend combined with his knack for creepy cinematic ambience it leaves the listener paranoid waiting for something to jump out from around a corner fingers bank pads shoe prints is not as flashy as boos previous album legacy that record was characterized by a mathematical rhythmic intensity exemplified by head-spinning arrangement techniques like looping a sample that is two-thirds the tracks speed so that it doesnt sit quite correctly but occasionally meets up with the downbeat this new lp is understated by comparison with fewer jarring moments and more shifting grooves at times fingers recalls s early productions such as those from his recent classics reissue on which foreshadowed many of the stylized syncopations to come but didnt quite break from the party-ready rhythms of 90s ghetto house tracks like bangn dr and have elements of high drama but theyre also easy to grab on to and ride; four-to-the-floor rhythms and spastic samples lock effortlessly into place after a couple laps around the track daddys is a classic outing with vintage action movie samples blaring under thick soul singing that cuts abruptly in and out of the mix the other hand let s is built on buoyant vocal harmonies that bring out boos soft and sensitive side it goes to show that progress often requires a look back at the past and proves that although hes been in the game since literally inventing footwork nearly two decades ago is continuing to develop as an artist

has been on a roll since a 2012 mini-lp with kassem mosse brought him to wider attention it helped that by then his style was fully formed: a strange cryptic take on house music melodically unusual and rhythmically devious 2013s after the job for hinge finger showed that he could make big gestures in this way albeit deeply eccentric ones this ep for belgian experimental label finds the producer on subtler form opener a superb slice of deep-sea funk is the records oddball apex its snippets of percussion and glutinous synths float past like weird-looking creatures in the abyssal murk; in the low-lit midpoint breakdown its easy to forget were in a house track altogether doesnt hold together quite so well its warped melodies barely audible behind a clodhopper kick by the time comes around lifting us from the sea floor its a welcome change the bubbling synths and fidgety tin-can percussion gesture at s brighter side though the track remains a thoughtful deep soak rather than a source of easy thrills as the record wraps up with a puzzling snippet of street noise and synth noodling leaves questions teasingly unanswered
plus 8 breathes new life into two underground techno gems with this reissue of s and s menity both remastered for this release (aka peter ) once signed to rhythm king and sire masterminded the ifach label on which (ifach001) originally had a limited release in 1994 following his trax lp singles each ump and milky tres first collaborated with (ian ) on 1991s fetish before later joining forces as minimal man is spaced out sulky techno at its best; light years ahead of its time and one of the pairs most memorable moments this dark departure takes you into an almost concealed world with its sense of the mysterious whispers of its jones coupled with echoing pads and rippling snares keep this almost stoned groove going transporting the mind to some wonderfully odd places so much of the minimal sound which is currently en vogue gained its inspiration from tracks like this and this reissue should appeal to newer fans of the minimal etiquette who appreciated its tripped out vibe is mark pritchard one half of the global communication/jedi knights along with tom middleton who originally released menity in 1992 on evolution/universal language menity is an affirmation of life; brimming with positivity thanks to its usage of a beautiful warm synth melody this opens the imagination to many possibilities with delicate light pads and strings completing the piece so well the track is almost ambient in nature; 3 minutes pass before we are presented with a rhythm which fortunately adds energy but doesnt detract from the beauty of the track music like this is a pleasure to listen to confirming that electronic sounds are capable of both depth and meaning this is a real sunrise moment bringing new hope and optimism to lost souls this release from plus 8 is in keeping with their now customary high standard the re issue brings two highly sought after pieces to a new generation and those who missed out the first time round whereas one side is steeped in dark obscurity the other provides the perfect antidote music like this doesnt really need any hype just an open mind and a willingness to listen

i dont yet know if future volumes of lost treasures will draw solely from s back catalogue or whether the name will simply act as a masthead to re-tell the histories of multiple artists parker could probably do it alone the detroit house-head has dozens of aliases the oldest of them stretching back to the early 90s the 1995 track remixed here loves came out under the most prolific of them seven grand housing authority boss marc romboy takes the reins on the a-side when faced with a dominant house vocal such as this all too often the result is a totally original track with the a cappella pasted on top romboy has taken the high road lovingly polishing the vintage elements and then slowing them to a more reflective tempo the result is a fetching piece of piano house with a lumbering low-end on the other side jimpsters remix is a bit more daring an original-sounding bassline plays out alone for some time before the british producer hints at vocals and percussion when the kick finally comes along he eases back on these once more resetting the track to austerity
its tricky manoeuvre the vanguard est laid schemes go oft astray as the one dimensional quest for something nay anything new can come at a cost of substance its a good thing be challenged and accessibility is not necessarily a praiseworthy quality but surely it is a sign of artistic adroitness that something so undeniably different can make such complete sense in an instant this intriguing double header from and does just that its apparently a teaser from london label soul jazz of a forthcoming lp entitled future ass in which forward thinking artists such as the two currently in question kevin martin un ld and others will pitch their ideas of what morrow sounds like if kieran hebdens vision as outlined here turns prophetic then morrow is something look forward he seems possess a remarkable ability coax genuine beauty out of an amalgamation of ostensibly unlikely sounds in for instance theres a youve got mail alert a knock on the door a record skipping a drum kit thrashed and a general soup of electric bleeps and burps that are rubbed gether until by the time bass enters the fray at four minutes your concept of harmony has become more about ones and zeros than major or minor perhaps most surprising of all the normally wonky hebden lays down a beat that can best be described as jackin and in doing so gives esotericism a groove s effort is the more genre conformist of the two considering the continuous strides forward currently being made within the greater dubstep scene though its no less interesting the beat is recognisable enough but the oscillating pinpricks and languishing melody strung out on a harmonica make for an atypical piece of dubstep that as with manages charge ahead without ever losing uch
released in september s world of waking state was one of this years surprise album highlights deeper and more detailed than the berlin-based artists previous work it explored a murky sound somewhere between techno idm and electro full of nimble rhythms and ambiguous moods six-week period spent producing the album was especially fertile for a point the new white label hammers home it presents two extra tracks that float in the same esoteric zone as the earlier full-length albeit better suited for dj use is one of the rare 4/4 tunes to emerge from those six weeks it lands closer to conventional techno than anything on the album which means you shouldnt have much trouble mixing with it bpm is in the mid-130s but the twitching bassline and cosmic synths get even trippier when slowed to house tempo s halftime swagger is deeper still laying down another shuffling rhythm adorned with glistening snippets of icy melody for anyone who loved world of waking state but couldnt find a place for it in their sets this white label is for you

victor hugo once wrote that music expresses that which cannot be put into words but while its true that few media can represent emotions like love or anger in the way music can it also has many other purposes as well just think of the vast number of compilations mixes and re-edits on the market that explore distinctive contexts genres clubs or even something more personal to the artist or the compiler the latter seems to be the case with pthalo records origins series this collection of mostly unreleased early john tejada tracks is a kind of short thesis on the stylistic roots of the producer tejadas work under the name was as the title suggests influenced strongly by early aphex twin and autechre-style bedroom techno presumably working with the same sorts of machines its further proof that while tejada has never been one to buck trends or sail into uncharted territory think of some of his biggest tunes sweat on the walls or the end of it all hes been able create a sound thats unmistakably his own that unique tejada trademark was still a work in progress at this stage in the mid 90s as you can hear on the producer was quite obviously listening to autechres amber its cascades of mournful analogue slinking along with foreboding and menace other familiar features include syncopated kicks and crisp reverbed electro snares that crackle in the high-midrange all of these are staples throughout the album but it would be unfair to dismiss recovered as samey and average standout moments include and when its delicate chills of floating in space are warmed up golden by a subtly offset beautiful melody its a truly moving progression which shows off tejadas classically developed skill with harmony the hyperactive power-glitter-tech of and the deep bubble chamber that meanwhile are among the more interesting journeys that tejada takes us on here though they rarely stray as far as say the corners of the galaxy traversed by jeff mills in his gamma player compilations it also lacks the timelessness of amber or aphexs saw 85-92 theres plenty to recovered data but unfortunately this doesnt include the subtle spark that made warp records early output so special and that now makes tejadas music what it is having said all this the value of rating it against more developed material is probably less than that of analysing it historically and the greatest value lies in the enjoyment of the album itself to that end is decent listening music which showcases a talent on the brink of finding a language all his own
few subgenres in electronic music seem as fixed as dub techno: pick up a marbled 12-inch bearing the name of one physics concept or another and you more or less know what youre in for marco rhauderwiek rhauder to most challenges that perception opening the usual signifiers up to deliciously funky infiltrations his latest for ornaments is a follow-up of sorts to no news his 2009 collaboration with paul tikiman st hilaire but where no news floated dreamily towards dawn finds rhauder and tikiman wide awake pushing a refreshingly immediate sound kicking off in a mist of maurizio-esque shades the original mix of quickly sharpens its teeth with snappy handclaps and an insistent bassline providing st hilaire with a prickly bed on which to drop knowledge (the vocal production present and intimate with the slightest trace of delay is commendably subtle ) dub version leads us into the steam room on the back of a stronger beat and gooier melody and a quick pop- -dub version distils the originals brightest colors into something like a radio edit it all adds up to as lively a dub techno record as youre likely to hear a tune sure to pair nicely with your locales next heatwave

comes mixed courtesy of a man who has been around the industry and constantly delivered the goods for the last decade or two inspired by a recent dj set of fabric this mix comes to show that andrew still has got what it takes to be a top draw talent in the dj world as he unleashes an array of twisted tunes with a bit of a funky edge the mix has some great early highlights including the opener i need a freak by sexual harassment the mix has a bit of a quirky electro tinge in the opening fee minutes a point emphasized by the nice and floaty syntax erik mix of m/s langara by kango s stein massive the beats start to get a bit more chunk in them as alexkid s vocal mix of don t hide it enters as does the crisp and stuttering beats of dunufus by delon and delcon the mix continues to gain a bit of a sinister vibe as shown by the dark and gritty synth patterns of robot dance by jesper dahlback but it soon sits back into a smooth flow when john tejeda unleashes his mix of miwon the conclusion is quite nice with 2 lone swordsmen mix of dexter by ricardo villalobos providing one of the highlights of the album and not to mention the final track by technova as they provide some nice melodic twirls amongst a smooth backdrop of sounds and warm moments and some beautiful vocals taken from joy divisions emotional hit atmosphere to be perfectly honest the album doesn t flow as good as it could be but weatherall more then makes up for that with a stellar track selection the mixing isn t too bad at all and to be honest the mix is very enjoyable mainly thanks to the various tastes of andrew s record box

for the fourth release on his label jan jelinek returns to his alias for the first time since 2004 with a mixture of archival material and new productions its unclear whether that distinction is by track or whether all four cuts fuse old and new but it doesnt really matter they all have a similar heft and density like fistfuls of milky agates clouded with overlapping samples warbly burnished with vinyl crackle and plenty of high-end squeak and warble s is so often the case with jelinek its hard to say just where his sounds come from begins with two minutes of modulating drones an electronic wheeze not so far off from the gloopy modular mayhem captured on s ursula bogner collection that introduction gives way to brushed cymbals and chimes that sketch out house musics rhythms without any of its edge instead of crisp kicks and handclaps you get mealy mushy things like chromatic flute runs fluttering oscillators and dissonant percussive samples possibly from flea-market serialist finds its like the soundtrack to some long-lost animated film from the 60s a czech documentary about blood vessels say or jellyfish is similar in feel with lots of clanging pinging percussion and errant harmonics but its less tentative digging into a deep progression of sampled chords and availing itself of reassuring sub bass mapping scavenged jazz to a house clip its very but in its timbral range and its overall structure it also suggests how much more musical jelinek has gotten since he started releasing records 12 years ago uses the same familiar palette of thuds and creaks with a beautiful bass clarinet lead that burrows its way through like a worm through rotten wood in fact it seems to recycle sounds used in but its far more focused like a tone poem for a playground full of rusty swings 1 2 has an actual 303 bassline almost the only nod to techno convention on the entire record but from the weird slump of the chords to the omnipresent incidental din its hardly mistakable for anything else
after the release of petter s these days has been a label i have been paying close attention to always releasing quality deep no pun intended records from highly talented producers this release will see the release from swedish delavari s follow up from last summer s about you and the new single is already a favorite among the big players in the progressive scene sasha and warren have been destroying dance floors for months and soon enough every one else will have the chance as well the single finds three versions with this outing with a special remix by petter everyone should be paying attention at petter right now this young bedroom producer turned superhero is on a tear not long ago he was just like you in his bedroom making tracks now he has become someone to watch for with every release and remix petter s in the loop mix takes the a-side all for himself as we hear a monstrous interpretation petter s set to destroy the dance floor with a bangin four-to-the-floor bass kick mixed with deep spacey madness the track feels like an exploration of space much in the tone of quivver s stage one the groove is solid with its hypnotic mutation of spanish guitars and space melodies i swear what i m writing doesn t express how ace this track is as samuel jackson would say this is one baddddddmotherfucker over to side b and i mean no disrespect when i say it s just a b-side track we get a lowered and laid-back edition no kidding when rouzbeh called it the broken staircase mix i swear everything is as if it were moving in slow motion there are delays that affect the outcome of the melody and it makes everything here feels like it s blurry until the 4/4 beat moves in techy rhythms are developed more to further the track along the highway it s a nice track but petter s version blows delavari s own original one to bits but if it wasn t for the original i wouldn t be hearing the remix and to that praise must be given to the original as the foundation for the a-side the entrance short edit is hip-hop meets breakbeat i think that should tell all the overall sounds are more atmospheric and groovy more weight is on the acoustic guitar and rising synths that can be heard in the middle of the track a darker and serious tone can be heard in the edit overall another great release by petter s version will be highly sought after rouzbeh s is a tight melodic progressive track chunky and smooth on one side and a very groovy and dark one on the other: not all three tracks are your typical mill of the progressive slab of records very much ahead of the pack is helping border community as two labels that instinctively come up when thinking about forward progress in underground dance music
the zenker brothers and their label have worked for years to establish their individual take on techno the second bias jams release presents an established veteran with some newcomers and makes a bite sized cross section of the imprints style in the process offers a standard cut with a smeared barely there melody like the best of his work a discrete house touch via loose snare work keeps the track on its toes brightons serg offers the least distinctive newbie turn though its no slouch theres a wonderful but subtle swing to the way its chords slot into the comparatively rigid hi hat pattern italian producer (not to be confused with the andy stott alias) stands out with which features an impish bassline that doesnt sound like it could fit amidst the hectic percussion but the pi ce de r sistance of belongs to another fresh face beau better known as night slugs associate helix he throws down the fearsome which takes a bright chord sample and feeds it through a shredder nailed down by temper tantrum kick drums theres certainly something catchy in there but youd get trampled trying to isolate just what

since its genesis last year locks s has been run with a certain grace that feels otherwise absent from drum bass encompassing its elegant artwork slow steady release schedule of course the exquisite music it releases even narratives most aggressive moments have been suffused with enveloping body heat like the warmth of a hearty sip of good whiskey this is drum bass that sounds more suited to movie credits than raves the fourth release h s over the reins to someone other than locks for the first time the results are every bit as lovely s is tough but everything from its theatrically creeping chords to its fluid drums is prime narratives the screeching basslines other melodic devices flash like shooting stars captured in slow motion the restless drum programming calling to mind stray comes from a totally different place than the pedestrian loops of minimal drum bass locks or take the flipside it exemplifies what makes the label such a diamond in the rough loosely slotting into the utonomic sound with its deep valley of reverb pairs slamming halftime beats with rousing chords rising basslines it could be a call to arms or a wrenching scene of bereavement either way its stunning
until now has mostly been a place for techno artists to experiment with a harder more industrial sound on one louder the dutch duo ghost in machines debut ep for the label its the other way around frank nitzinsky and nils van lingen have been involved in the hardcore scene for decades nitzinsky is the drum bass artist eye-d hes also in outside agency with no l wessels aka dj hidden the revered industrial hardcore act behind genosha recordings van lingens mindustries is still performing at major hardcore meet-ups and had a release on prspct xtrm last year ghost in machine is a techno project and a rollicking one at that if you backtrack through ghost in machines releases youll find a running grill gag re are spoonerisms in the titles as well evidence of the goofy sense of humour behind the unyielding music but theres nothing scuffed up or dirty about their sound here this is clean and mean techno tough punchy and tightly coiled and end ) have creaking industrial hues but the best thing about this ep is its drive s a slamming power surge from the off energy snowballs most formidably on which becomes a throbbing mass of noise that you cant avoid stomping to fists balled and teeth bared
the 2nd disc of something to live for by returns with two new remixes one a chunky electro and the other a smooth breaks effort the stef vrolijk 16 bit lolitas remix is first up and they deliver a pretty smooth yet solid remix full of chunky beats a gritty and dirty electro baseline and only subtle elements of the main vocal the production flows quite nicely for the most part and becomes a little bit more epic late one with some smooth melodic patterns mike miller turns in a pretty smooth flowing breaks remix on the flip armed with a moody baseline and some nice intricate sounds that create a fantastic aura to this remix the main vocal plays quite a big role in this remix as it sits nicely above the beats as well as in the few breakdowns in the production not a bad disc here with two pretty solid remixes that are thankfully not too similar and both offer very good moments
has made a career out of the minor key his epic end-of-the-night deep house for depressed clubbers is now a cottage industry his formula for the title track here is much the same as it has seemingly always been: is a slow-moving tune that languidly lays out a soft beat perfect for the starry-eyed tinkled synths that interweave with one another its yet another fully-formed song ripe for the warm-up kersten knows his audience which is why its followed immediately on the a-side by a reprise of the same taking the kick out and showcasing how well his melodies hold up without a steady thump behind them its reminiscent of kaitos beatless album for kompakt and the effect is the same: light airy and perfect dj tool fodder things pick up as much as they can on a ep on the b-side with which plys a similar tone as with a tiny bit more urgency behind the beat ultimately though the track falls into the trap that much of his output has recently: its easy listening house with melodies too simplistic to give it a specialness that extends it beyond its modest aims far more successful is the bell-laden ambient work which again takes kaitos sound and runs with it if mule and arent plotting a release of more ambient-driven material they ought to: painting s sound in a new light it offers up proof that theres life in his sound yet

heres a bit of a strange one apparently spains dubbyman heard the two-minute-and-change song sketch that was from oakland duo lady blacktronika mattski and knew he had something track is little more than ambient noise of a city street four organ notes and blacktronika singing but you can tell where hes coming from: mattski somehow turns it into enough to keep you engaged and blacktronika is passionate but reserved at the same time after that though things get scrubbed up when dubbyman and his brother come in with the clean organs and beatdown house on the remix its nice but it loses something in the sound upgrade im wholly conscious that i may be underrating dubbymans effort though because on the flip is one of my favorite hypnotic burners of the current year: s beat is nothing a simple lightly syncopated plod but the static radio vocals of blacktronika looping the title and yeah and the equally dreamy and unstable sampled atmosphere are exquisite ( subtle sizzling percussion that finds its way into the stereo field helps plenty ) it holds you captive for its seven-minute length so much so that you can almost forget what comes before youre on the is classic slo-mo house another beatdown cut but one that has the sort of rawness that will fit neatly into a moodymann set
arry lynn of northern ireland makes increasingly lavish dubstep funky garage nexus stuff as since he records largely for planet mu its easy to mistake him for someone on somewhat of a sharper angled more jokester tip s for the moniker lynn told headphone commute last year that it only makes sense in the context of a few of the earlier tracks its got attached to a much broader spectrum of music than id ever expected readth of spectrum is key to this eps appeal (its on kinnego which released space dimension controllers breakthrough 12 inch ) ll three tracks here (one digital only) are sure handed and generous with detail the mp3 bonus is the most lavishly widescreen: all manner of percussion from a tv switch off to a pattering ride cymbal travels evenly from left to right while funky wormy synths get in sleek nerd funk riffs before the track deconstructs itself finds a groove thats sleek and even a little whimsical its rooted hard in 1999 era 2 step but its frosty production touches (the crisp drums the flurrying strings/woodwinds the flown in sound effects that fill out the rhythm instruments) are lightly baroque 2time explores a purple 80s r feel to sleek effect
lauded by dance floor occupants who seek heavy bass and tropical flair is no newcomer to dance music as one of the label heads and djs of nightshifters she has developed a reputation as brooklyns bass sweetheart with her first production effort it released on the dancehall flavored records home to the likes of dubbel dutch and vybz kartel she is finally stepping outside of her comfort zone behind the decks where shes been mixing for years both tracks on it offer skittering soca percussion patterns she also gives a direct nod to her south florida roots with the name of the tough miami town where bassheads often flock to dance the night away however in spite of the eps beach party vibe the tracks dont necessarily hold up on their own they have a tendency to feel extra long and open-ended making them more appropriate as interludes or embellishments for layering an obvious move considering her history as a dj though shes still finding her voice as a producer it nonetheless does well in announcing her style: dancehall with humor and spunk
if as ronan fitzgerald rates them is one of the top ten uk labels to watch then s forthcoming simple sounds compilation is its calling card two-disc set it seeks to locate simple in the dance music firmament five years after its birth part and parcel with this cd release are three eps each complete with a saul original and a remix by a saul fave the first ep brings an exclusive 3000 d it leads off the cd but the version here is a few minutes longer extending the pensive chords that open and close the track in between we get a healthy dose of sauls romantic streak via fathomless pads and lush synths deep begins to describe it but that somehow fails to capture the way this turns everything epic for a few minutes wahoo (innervisions major domo dixon and producer georg levin) show up on the -side remixing their take discards the digitalism of 3000 d and goes for live-sounding drums giving the track a propulsion it previously lacked even so it sounds as though saul used the same synth palette for 3000 d as he did for making the moment when the chords peek through the jungle an intensely familiar one that said even if saul is beginning to pull the same rabbit out of his hat im pretty eager to find out how many times he can do it before i want him to stop
last few years have been kind to the resurgent industrial dance b founded by tom ellard in the midst of european american tours their scuzzy proto-rave material has undergone a reevaluation especially in terms of how it might work on a dance floor this has been thanks in part to a glut of well-considered reissues by is the most substantial one to date album was the pinnacle of the groups cavalier exploration into the world of backmasking tape splicing all the processed effects the period had to offer is a tonally dark album speckled with dirt petrol but the reissue has been remastered with better equipment than the rudimentary rol akai drum machines that provided the foundation for the 1986 original (whether the sampling of a smashed watermelon launched from a window crunching onto the concrete below has been attempted a second time is unknown ) albums 84-minute length can be a slog to get through at first tracks like surge stagger as if a drunk ellard were st ing over you across the album his dark mutterings conjure feelings of discomfort displacement adding curdled texture to an already noisy palette he spins absurdist tales of army-bound girlfriends travelling showmen riddled with bullets safari romps in mozambique a t te- -t te in tel aviv but its barely distinguishable at times as if heard through the wall of an adjacent room lps primary focus though is the gnarly soundscapes loping forthright basslines s modulated throb meets tampered vocals to come off like garbled phone calls from another world as the electricity-experiment-gone-wrong of caseys bursts through into the drum workout of with screams from the former track still audible its an emphatic moment a genuine thrill flirts with the showy synth pop songwriting of the time its hi-nrg glide recall new order at their most speed-addled loose with a bit of muck wiped off the recording desk it could have been a hit it would still do dance floor damage in the right h s today reissue includes eight offcuts extended edits additional material is a combination of smoothed-out tools that play off the shoulder of originals ( ) treats for completists like missing from the north american release in 86 a captivating change is found in which shows ellard at his most vulnerable his wavering voice here is a precursor to the bleary-eyed ballads of b s like horrors disco inferno nine inch nails extended version of improves the already strong original by the simple addition of space in the mix this album isnt a natural entry point if youre looking to get into b s singles compilation bulkhead might be the easiest route for first-timers to get a feel for the b captures them in a point of transformation where the b s early psych experiments still linger before ellard drove it deeper down a more electronic rabbit hole for every chugging theres also a skin-crawling nightmare like thats not for everyone but manage to look fabulous perched on a smouldering scrapheap get the sense its where they belong

jinx in dub (aka joss braund) is one half of breakbeat production duo jinx who have released tunes on yes mate burrito and have forthcoming material to be released on move ya steve lavers audiobug label jinx in dub showcases joss dub/reggae side of breakbeat and his debut release on (quite possibly the current home of ragga-fused breakbeat) is ska warz/live direct grimey bouncy ragga beats is the flavour of the day with live direct featuring a very bouncy bassline synth riff and a vocoder heavy ragga vocal as it progresses it incorporates dark eastern flavoured melodies and howling noises in the background with bits and bobs of percussion thrown in definitely a big skanking groove to be heard in this one ska warz on the flip features more bouncing ragga grooves with an emphasis on upbeat reggae keys giving the tune an overall summertime feel joss throws down a raggaman vocal chant and plenty of quirky electro noise all held together by a very cheeky bassline im a big fan of the ragga breaks sound but for some reason these just didnt do it for me i much prefer jinxs more uplifting and slamming breaks tunes
in the past year or so the london-based blog has closely documented the emergence of a new generation of instrumental grime producers the latest signing to its label melbournes air max 97 reflects a shift in focus towards a more nebulous kind of contemporary club music which mixes grime with an international spread of influences including hip-hop and r b post-night slugs hybrids of ballroom and jersey house the synthetic textures of the dis magazine set and so on in this anything-goes climate air maxs own coinage oblique club trax seems as good a descriptor for his music as any his productions are clearly aimed at the dance floor but they attempt to get feet moving in the most discombobulating way possible the producers first official release a collection of strange forms rendered in cold metallic tones shows he hasnt yet found the equilibrium between weird and wonderful the faintly footworky and is the most dynamic of the lot; and both slower are intriguing but less compelling all three feel like studies in rhythm grooves from different styles are bolted together and peppered with odd cross-rhythms unfortunately we struggle to get beyond the exploratory stage a fact not helped by some slightly flimsy mixdowns air maxs ideas are very promising and with a little time hopefully hell work out how best to frame them in the meantime young night slugs affiliate neana shows him how its done his version of the title track is relentlessly groovy and primed for club use there are shades of club constructions in its clipped chord stabs and syncopations but neana is rapidly making the sound his own
first release on freerange in is a second helping of refittings of s jazz constructed house the original might not have been all that but the first edition is worth picking up for kerri chandlers typically righteous and soulful remix on the b yet take plenty of cash with you here berlins stefan has managed to top even kerri with a timeless deep house rework first up though solid trades his usual bump and ghetto jive for more melody keys and soul with results that i rather like sunday chords stab and swirl around rolling beats the bpm is slow - always good for the ladies while the melody is catchy and very yesteryear production wise it s not as tight as daves other work but nevertheless this a nice edge to his studio sword but the b-side is truly where the action is stefan charges out of the changing room with a remix that is super deep and makes me smile unashamedly this has all the warmth and layering of goldemanns recent work on perlon and innervisions: sliding soft clicks and double handclaps set the tone the looped elements build the pads stream deep underneath a reversed pitched up and generally fucked with vocal that nearly pushes this into classic territory nice warm and well dressed skip the and go directly to the solid groove on the b stefans got the zeitgeist down to a t

serves up a slightly delicious mix of tech-house meets tribal with this three mix release from coxys 23rd century records the original mix has a meaty groove with pulsating sub-bass and tribal percussion creating an energy from the start this is turned into a funkiness as the combination of jacked up rhythms vocal sample exclaiming and subtle melody creeps out from added tribal elements the more see dub slides into a housier box with rumbling rezd bassline angry stabby synths along with contrasting rhythms that give it a neat swing this is made a little sweeter as underneath tweaked vocal cuts add anther edge to what is a simple idea last up is the more hear dub which shifts it into an electro fused take with a 2/4 beat keeping up the pace as zippy synth sounds carve out an aggressive mood which closes the door on this release nicely
once again sees frankfurt resident share a record with nanda however unlike last years gcf on nandas own asmati imprint its not a collaborative effort takes the side with a meek cut which is strung around a muted shaker and a series of wide sweeping its pretty simplistic or at least appears to be something which works entirely to its advantage its the kind of track that fits perfectly into the middle of a big room set; a less demanding groover to keep the momentum going while still providing a rest on the other side nandas effort is more overtly peak time funky little bassline leads the proceedings coupled with tumbling percussion that could only be the work of the german producer theres a hook too its not so in your face but youll probably be hearing it a lot in the next few months anyway thin synthetic strings rub together with increasing intensity before nanda twice whips them away to showcase the bassline like s effort its seemingly simple stuff confident of its own substance
this latest offering from arcelonas heroically creative finds jmii and pettre aka sounding more straightforwardly housey than they did on their other ep for the label last years danza is built on clean beats sweeping strings and a classic house piano line a distorted vocal loop taken from the ritish rave culture documentary high on hope completes a brew thats sure to please fans of icep who contribute two remixes oth reworks have been in the pipeline long enough to have featured on the northern irish pairs unreleased traxx eats in space mix nearly a year ago with icep ii given the unofficial title (by me) of that amazing one with the ooh baby vocal sample a thumping bass drum celestial pads and that echoing vocal snippet coalesce into a nailed-on seven minutes of mid-90s house bliss icep i blends tottering bass a rangy background synth and racing hats to create a differently pitched but no less floor-ready beast
in his review of s last -released missive ras david fowler commented on the surprise many felt upon learning that the producer wasnt a new alias for one of dub technos masters listening to the first track on the latest from the man born denis safiullin im a little surprised isnt cottams new techno guise: as syrupy as the title suggests the track employs the very cottam-like strategy of giving his machines plenty of breathing room albeit with murky dub textures replacing scratchy samples by waxtest has picked up the pace (albeit only to a trot) and this sort of groove as clunky a jam as it is its synths flanging and quantization thrown out the window may be a better more distinctive look faster still finds unlikely hooks in stuttering synths and a gloomy fog that lurks just below the surface all over a subtly dexterous beat pared down to what sounds like one synth and a handful of drum sounds comes off more like an etude than full-on track but i sense is still experimenting with how to put all the pieces together like b-tracks on their breakout specialize from earlier this fall seems to have internalized much of whats happening in house right now and hes just getting started on carving out his own niche within it
this is graeme clarks first release since last summers body fusion ep and like that one its released on his own label contains a classic house cut followed by two tracks that feel inspired by the work of fellow glasgow producers auntie flo and esa the pretty undulating house of is the pick here it features a euphoric virgo four-style synth line cavorting over solid analogue percussion takes things off in a lightly african-themed direction with bounding high-pitched bongos forming an infectious spine over which an acidic ribbon of bass and various vocal fragments first appear separately and then swell together in cacophonous floor-slaying style the african theme is taken even further on closer on which bongos and bass drums pepper an alternately smooth and spiky landscape of windy pads and malfunctioning robot bleeps its interesting collision of styles if not always a completely successful one

hope recordings have been around a good few years now and have brought to the fore artists such as max graham starecase grayson shipley etc and with this theyre 54th release they bring to our attention another new artist for them parallel sound are muza hove and tim lloyd and if we are to believe the bumf have built a strong reputation in the clubs with a live show containing only theyre own material and that theyre tunes have been championed by the likes of john digweed james holden and jonathan lisle among others but are they any good well on the strengh of this release i would say yes on the a side starts off with some nice chunky percussion before a soulfull female vocal enters the fray the track then changes tack slightly bringing in an almost speed garage style bassline to compliment the vocal it shouldnt work but it kind of does on the flip we have echo and this time the parallel boys go for a chunky breaks track with melodies sprinkled liberally on top this track has a slight old school feel as well which is nice and complements the a side very well at a time when a lot of the old labels are becoming extinct its nice to see one of them flourish and if they keep up this standard of release hope recordings will be around for sometime yet
