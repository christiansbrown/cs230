after morrissey s contribution to this new series from dmc it s time for to go after being a major part of one of the bands of the 90 s in stone roses this mix is very similar to a back to mine in that it is a snapshot of what tastes in music are all about not necessarily a mix cd it s more a gathering of different styles of music from hip hop to soul the first track in particular is a highlight by gza and genius in liquid swords the first half of the cd then moves into a period of reggae inspired music where fade away by junior byles acts as a particular highlight with its deep dubby baselines fug by cymande acts as a transition to more funk styles until the cd includes a bit of rock with lover by the de-lites the compilation definitely has variety and diversity on its side and unless you really have a varied taste in music then not all of the selection may appeal to you if reggae soul and funk sound good to you on one cd then this may be your thing
on the eve of their debut lp (gavin russom and viva ruiz) strip down the album cut a gooey psychedelic fro-latin number soaked in organs and his/her vocals to the bare essentials with a lot of this kind of deeply analog do-or-die live-in-the-studio stuff its one idea beaten over and over not necessarily a bad thing mind if that one idea is strong enough ut russom has a way of cutting up long hypnotic jams into passages that dont seem to have anything to do with each other and without losing any sense of continuity underpinning the nearly nine-minute-long is a single monotonic bassline not even a line just one note threaded through a bumptious 707 drum pattern; the foundation doesnt change much but the floor plan has all the twists and turns of the winchester mystery there are hissed and muttered glossolalic outbursts lcd soundsystem yelps and weirdly panned cooing choruses; the organs feel like theyve been thrown at the wall like big chunks of meat and left to slide down in bloody streaks the dub mix puts the emphasis back on the bass and organ interplay with the vocals (mostly) erased and the muted drums as cool and damp as a dewy lawn at six in the morning
the temperature drops a few degrees the moment you put on an track and his third release is no different his style is meticulous and has a steely sheen hes a master of technicalities an ep like saudade is so effective because of its intelligent design composure and all-round sleekness not that his techno is over-buffed or bookish you can totally freak out to it is a typical head trip: squirrelly and refined without a hair out of place is just shy of sounding like a paranoia-induced meltdown but keeps any rash displays pegged down tight a few mordant bubbles escape in a rush to the surface but thats it mostly the tracks make an adroit use of dynamics and tension which are in effect on the stealthy albeit in a more muted way might be s most hallucinogenic effort yet he doesnt loosen his grip but keeps the momentum as rigorous as ever allowing the details to do the subversive work
release number 3 from bristol based comes from german producer whos produced tunes for major labels such as sony universal and bmg as well as smaller labels like germanys dangerous drums and his own viperjive imprint is a dark slab of breaks infused with hip hop garage and drumnbass influences with october providing a remix side v is a electro-infused number featuring a razor sharp hook deep growling bass and a hip hop vocal which gives rise to the name as the tune progresses it incorporates more techy stabs effects and wobbles a build up on the bass and a few cleverly placed drum fills (a bit plump sounding too ) towards the end the tune kills the bass and drops into a percussive breakdown its built for a dark peaktime floor however it tends to get a bit riffy side s (october remix) vs signee october takes the tune and provides a much darker (even darker than it already is) remix incorporating a booming bassline (similar to tipper and fuel records in some sense) a new variation on the razor like hook hard hitting pads and a percussive breaks lick laced on top giving the tune an underground grimy feel
howard ernstein widely known as is a bit of a veteran he has done it all with a lot of success he has been prominent in the music industry since the early 80 s but it wasn t really until the early 90 s that became the big name that he is today working with artists such as goldie massive attack as well as co producing u2 s pop album which included an invitation to produce the live sound for its accompanying world tour not an achievement many can lay claim to despite this huge success story in the production field still tears the dancefloors apart when behind the decks this abriclive mix indicates nothing less mix starts in a quirky manner with the electro ridden by s on the other hand is a total different class breathtaking drum patterns with an exotic melody splattered with accapella which leads smoothly into the pmt mix of the same tune many should be familiar with medicine s robot induced remix of in by s trademark sound is ever present with his remix of by eautiful by is as it name suggests a beautiful fusion of breakbeat and tribal instincts the should have you hopping around with its bouncing baseline while take you eyond the early 90 s and straight into the 80 s ar provides the finale to the mix with oundation a slow reggae inspired record to slow it down to a halt this is a brilliant mix and in my opinion definitely one of the better abric releases which is a compliment in itself variety all blended masterfully has commented how difficult it was to do this mix but the results indicate that he put all his time and effort into this mix for you to simply sit back put the feet up and enjoy
the most surprising thing about s records has been their concision given each of the trios live performers has their own arsenal of modular gear it must be tempting to overstuff things but apparently last years eps for art records and brokntoys didnt go far enough on this followup for the group pare things back further the resultant electro tracks are impressively well sculpted but their subtle melodies and laser-precise drums sometimes lack distinguishing features in the eps first half simple details give the music the right smudge of colour on its a think break which lends bite to an otherwise clinical sound palette (the trio used breakbeats equally well on last years pusher ) on its a shifting melodic element which adds dynamism to a glistening battery of hi-hats and incidental percussion the other half of the ep struggles to maintain this balance s palpitating low-end isnt enough to hold attention the track feels half-empty until a sparse bassline enters in the latter half but its mixed timidly low the idm-ish is the eps most rhythmically inventive track its moods glowering menace at the opening dark melancholy later are expressed cautiously but the whole thing never quite finds its feet
a one sided 12 of the original of love is ok and odd quirky minimal techno operatic vocals hover over minimal dark drums and a haunting 3 note bassline the vocals are chopped up slowed down and repeated to form an interesting and original method of production angry twisted male speech appears later to form a contrast between warmth and sinisterness you don t hear stuff as unique as this too often these days and it s worth your hard earned dosh for that alone
produces house music where propulsive rhythms are married with raw grimy textures to often intriguing effect where his pma 12-inch on l i e s was more in keeping with that labels dusty aesthetic than his apron ep on his second release for funkinevens label beato strikes a fine balance between squelch and grit ep opens with a beatless track thats all synthesised strings and submerged vocal sample whos the in charge ovaa here is the eps highlight beginning with a bruising kick drum to which beato adds a new sound every couple of bars it remains spacious and vibrant even as it expands to incorporate a sticky bassline dreamy pads open hi-hats and rubbery synth lines snares and claps on dreamin are mucky but theyre offset by battering-ram kicks and belatedly a velvety bassline and jubilant chords brilliantly titled worship se is similarly sparse opening with echoing drum hits and a chirpy synth that makes way for abrasive pads and a sputtering groove beato reprises the submerged vocal sample of for satans a beatless coda whose centrepiece is an urgent sawing synth
not much is yet known about the label but thatll probably end soon the young swedish imprints debut 12-inch ticks all the right boxes: dance floor-friendly just weird enough to stand out and an anonymous producer at the helm whats not to like especially considering the music: somehow effortlessly merges dub techno and loopy mannheim house into a coherent package dropping a repeated vocal sample directly into an upbeat cloud of smoky 4/4 beats theres a reason its been charted by the likes of headfuck techno man samuli kemppi remote rea compatriot oris werner echocord boss kenneth christiansen tresor resident suzi wong and slow motion house man cottam isnt quite a crossover gem like the flip the way it reworks dub techno fundamentals however is equally as engaging jettisoning the vocal sample for a melody that seems to be built from someone quickly waving their hand in front of an air vent theres no lack of fascinating sounds on offer theres a bit less grooviness s raw beat hits and hits again with little variation criticizing its lack of swing though only serves to highlight the quality on hand is clearly a label to keep an eye on

recently complained to ra that techno [right] now is really fucking clean and its not really like its played in a warehouse a great quote but the berlin-based british producers debut album is a stronger statement of intent throws away the traditional techno toolkit rejecting generic drum sounds like snares and kicks and refusing synthesisers altogether it relies instead on field recordings of suitably metallic sounds underground trains rolling over tracks crunched-up foil treated beyond recognition the results are a distorted hybrid of the pummelling schranz of tommys label manager chris liebing and the blank minimalism of richie hawtins plastikman output while undeniably techno in its tempo and structure s abrasive aesthetic owes more to the 90s pioneers who dragged industrial metal onto the dance floor though unique in their origins the crackling percussion and short-circuited saws bear a stark resemblance to those used by say former nine inch nails member and remixer charlie clouser with end track an uptempo take on aphex twins own reznor refix at the heart of it all aware that all that distortion and the industrial size of the sounds can be overwhelming uses vocals to introduce a human element and a bit more soul he enlisted fellow expat sound designer emika whose hushed abstracted voice adds much-needed melody to g and its reprise tracks that poke their heads above the albums sea of noise gasping for air s neo-industrialism is a first step towards taking techno back to juan atkins original intention: music that sounds like technology it may be less conceptually neat than emikas own work on the ostgut ton f nf compilation (which used sounds recorded in berghain) but presents a singular uncompromising vision where listeners once heard the rusted machinery of a dying detroit between its beats techno today echoes the hollowed-out industrial spaces of berlin and the trains that take clubbers there isnt an easy listen but at least it contains the right sounds
has left quite a trail in a short time she hit the ground running mid 2009 with love dub on hyperdub an instant ear grabber especially for fans of the aquatic mid 90s jungle that served as a clear muse like a lot of producers lately male and female alike she sings (nicely with a touch of melancholy but more sweet than not) and on she pipes in a spare lyric: i know dis boy from round the way sounding most effective in ghostly isolation it makes things nicely ambiguous in s remix the tension plays out so that the track feels like a song even though it isnt structured much like one at all it calls up the specials and tricky as much as it does s hyperdub leaning peers s two tracks are peppier and make for a fetching contrast l vis s remix of is built on samples of running water papery hand drums and breaking glass beyond (obviously) the bass drops and layered percussion its a vivid mix of wet and dry (literally in a way) and grows more bass intensive as it goes but not more show offy is the wobbler; it could have been titled stuck inside of centipede with the space invaders blues gain
since 2006 some of germanys finest minimal house has been released on a boutique label called run by and even tuell the imprint is a modest but impressive operation with only six releases to date theyve pressed untitled tracks by the likes of move d sascha dive benjamin brunn and kassem mosse takes the helm on delivering three austere slow jams that make for one of the labels best installments yet the best track is the monolithic -side t 112 bpm it drifts along for a solid two minutes with little more than elliptical diva chrips and dubby warbles when the bass finally drops the track locks into a pumping groove its a lengthy jaunt but a lot happens over the course of its 11 minutes at the halfway mark the drums get a bit more syncopated and twinkling arpeggios draw up a spacey atmosphere cooling down the aggressive march of the tracks first half once you hear it this one is impossible to leave out of a low-tempo set the other two tracks achieve something entirely different restrained subtle grooves the first b-side track is laidback and almost lazy sounding with extra subdued drums and a choppy bass melody stirring up an understated groove it has a soft organic feel like something from soulphictions do you overstand the second b-side has the same careful rhythm and recalls some of the reverb-laden keyboards from the end of the -side its the least remarkable track on the ep but its restrained tone of suspense could make it an interesting dj tool the thudding -side is what really makes this record outstanding but all three are produced with a subtle craftsmanship that keeps them fresh for dozens of spins bring on 007
is the latest signing to a bristol label with one release so far under its belt control / consumption the excellent debut from systems of desire k kowton and hyetal s debut release is a pair of unashamedly retro hardware jams bundled with a funkineven remix finds a sweet spot between detroit techno and late- 0s boogie though its ripples of bright synth make the solid techno groove wonderfully tactile the vocal sample is too obvious and doesnt add much more machine funk than techno is better its cosmic synth lines and drum machine beats seem indebted to boogie and funk revivalist d m-funk though that doesnt necessarily detract from s knack for a great tune its hard to escape the feeling of familiarity funkinevens consummate skill is always welcome and he strips back to reveal its bare bones replacing the cosmic synths with a tougher loop that along with aggressive snares give the track a new urgency
parisian label has made late-night music its specialty new yorks joey anderson and workshop co-founder even tuell each released some of their prettiest and most introspective material on the label producing exquisite moments of dance floor bliss for closing-set djs with an adventurous streak is a nice addition to this crew: he too is a house music eccentric who favours unusual states of mind but even in this company his take on the raveyard shift is wonderfully weird and are both foggy low-slung rhythm workouts their grooves so slow and erratic that youd be forgiven for missing them entirely both work with a handful of samples slicing and retriggering in classic style the a-side with its dissonant guitar clusters and background distortion is probably the stronger of the two but both have a hypnotic quality that rewards deep listening preferably through a fog of exhaustion and alcohol closing the b-side blows out some of the cobwebs with arrhythmic synth blasts and the odd squeal of feedback has been bolder elsewhere but as a window into his strange universe is as good as any
many people are globally familiar with much of oslo electronic scene yet still somehow flies under radar the imprint run by a group of local djs and led by mung of mungolian jetset and yvind morken has released material from artists such as lindstr m lackbelt ndersen hardway ros and rune lindb k on this outing though its turn of ost kjex with ir rendition of princes tale of young desire the pop cover is a tried-and-true creative resource but norwegian disco producers seem to like it more than your average electronic knob twiddler todd terje mungolian and prince thomas have covered everything from wham to ob marley and this particular release sees duo similarly using form to experiment a bit and trade in deeper sounds found on ir recent diynamic releases for moroder-esque synth lines the arpeggiated melodies intertwine with each o r over a fast tech house beat and are surrounded with signature spacious sound that oslo and have become synonymous with vocals-wise though is where things get special as se two norwegian men in ir 30s turn tale of teen lust into a twisted story of two older men longing for teenage love sung in falsetto in same far-out fashion as jamie jones summertime only adds to bizarre quality of tune for those who cant take ost kjex vocal experience however yve graciously provided a dub version on flip which showcases just how much work and production is going on er underneath
a: sound of today after a massive entry into the breaks world have brought another fresh sounding downbeat number from renound producer - fink sound of today is a jazzy excursion into downtempo breaks at 135bpm i like to call it sex on wax the ultimate 6am tune programming with dreamy pianos and sexy saxaphones you truely need to witness this for yourself if youre a fan of fink then check this out aa: keeping the downbeat flavours throughout i dont know why is lighter on percussion but creates a mood to dim the lights and slide right on into more sax synths and pianos allow fink to take your mind and soul on a trip again music loves need only apply here
sounds like some heavy stuff doesnt it somehow it isnt londoner-via-paris succeeds on his debut by avoiding both the scratchy collagist aesthetic of crate-diggers like onra and the submerged quashed quality of most footwork for high-intensity percussive music that doesnt sound a whole lot like anything else out there opener spirations of a prisoner opens with cinematic strings and hollow rimshots no bass to be found anywhere before brings in tiny little clips of orchestral mayhem that serve as an ominously throbbing bassline features more traditionally frenetic footwork rhythms a flurry of cascading hollow drums and decaying synths but even this incorporation of familiar structures sounds totally unique other two tracks are much slower abandoning the footwork mission for their own skewed takes on bass music 88 bpm a is a sticky-slow hip-hop jam with a funk guitar more languid than lashing but the ep peaks with the 122 bpm frica) splaying a house-friendly flute panned to the extreme peripheries of the stereo spectrum the undulating bass riff at its centre totally eclipses everything the kind of eminently physical frequencies that feel like theyre enclosing around your entire head rather than just your ears though the track might not technically be footwork it plays around with footworks dread-inducing dislocated bass clouds inflating them to a grotesque level ts an uncanny tune that remains breathtaking from the first play to the tenth and a little stroke of genius that raises above the level of just another producer jumping on the footwork bandwagon
s first new material since 2013s majestic amygdala reaffirms two distinct strands of his musical personality is gorgeous almost to the point of parody as if aiming to achieve extreme levels of bliss it kicks off by pairing a muted beat with gentle swells of shifting pads a womans pitched-down voice eventually recites a monologue about ecstasy her words set against backdrops of soft key patterns and various percussive flourishes of course weve heard koze in this headspace before wide-eyed pop ambient contributions like hummell and nymphe und sch fer spring to mind but might be the best example koze switches from bliss to his sparky irreverent mode discordant burring keys and fx are carried along by a typically generous percussive frame its radically different character further sharpens the joys of while also being hugely enjoyable on its own terms
next up on uk label is an exciting release from israeli producers their latest offering not only comes with a solid original mix from the brothers themselves but it once again showcases the promising talents of young producer chris salt on the a side is indeed the chris salt remix for me it is probably the most impressive mix of the two as it really encapsulates the atmosphere from the original more so then the original does it contains delicate break beat patterns as well as sizzling synth riffs combined with a seductive vocal snippet all combining to glide smoothly in unison for the most part of the track the original mix on the aa side contains the usual trademark influences of the with a solid drum pattern utilized as well as a smooth and eerie atmosphere the vocal line for me doesn t sit as well as it does in this mix compared to the salt mix however the looped snippets of the vocal line work quite well a very nice release from and a release that will see the labels young prodigy chris salt continue to raise his profile with quality remixes like the one featured here
even with labels like butterz and logan samas rejuvenated earth616 londons grime scene still feels a bit like a shambles maybe thats why one of the genres most exciting producers doesnt get much coverage well anywhere he should take its got the grubby basslines and synth horns that youd expect from any producer who cuts close to the traditional grime line but unlike the lovable chintziness of other producers s track is embellished with gut-wrenching bass and full-throated synths the title track takes a filtered sample and throws a jerky frenetic beat on top halfway between j sweet and joker the release is rounded off with two s: goes all the way with the horror movie motifs sweeping strings and ominous brass and takes a slinkier almost funky-esque slant with cool chords and jazzy accents theres an uncommon amount of space in s tracks an inversion of grimes usual pressure-cooker claustrophobia and it means that he sounds bigger and meaner than some of his contemporaries so while he might not be throwing in video game interpolations or electric guitar solos into his grime s latest shows that theres a whole lot of life and innovation left in the old style as well
terrence dixon is a busy man these days in addition to releasing a new album under his own name this year he revived his old alias for releases on harbour city sorrow and the newly minted chronicle imprint this time the detroit producers alter ego strikes on and atmospheric weirdness is mostly shelved in favour of a for-the-jugular attack thats not to say the strange quality of those previous eps is gone its just trampled by the sheer velocity of tunes that each reach close to 140 pm t this speed theyre almost all kick drum ratty broken drum that is kicking up dust and debris all around the occasional hi-hat that struggles to break through the wall of noise slippery keyboard melodies blanket the rest of the midrange like he cant quite get his fingers straight enough to play a proper melody s its title would suggest to is a refashioning of sorts this time an eerie string melody is thrown underneath the crunchy crackling kicks while the same lopsided melody bleats in the chaos like a beacon in a storm
reviewing edits without having the source material close at hand is tough business so if this write-up basically amounts to me saying to you that yes this exists youll have to excuse me it is worth pointing out that these s a s edits exist however for a variety of reasons first and foremost theyre a ton of fun second everybody and their brother seems to be playing them (so many in fact that the promo sheet calls these tracks hotter than a hilariously [ sic ed] preverbal potato ) third fourth and fifth theyre a ton of fun men behind the project are brummie producers subb-an and adam shelton and from what i can tell they do an exceptional job of cutting things up for the and the to make the as dance floor-friendly as possible where you hear their talent though is in the dub versions duo are bassline-obsessed adding a nice one to which fills in for the lost personality of the lovably out-of-key freestyle singer while s bassline also gets beefed up considerably subb-an and shelton dont have much time for the quirkiness of the originals if memory serves a ridiculous doctor metaphor was excised from but the dance floor doesnt lie: se things work like a charm

kevin martin has spent much of his career working with other people from justin k broadrick (as god ice techno nimal and the rest) to the wide range of reggae and grime vocalists that have helped shape his sound as bug n theres king midas sound his project with kiki hitomi and roger robinson whose last album edition 1 featured the experimental guitarist fennesz his collaborations while uncannily suited to his guests always sound intrinsically like his own work his new album with earth founder dylan carlson is another example of this rare skill recent earth albums 2011s darkness demons light i and 2012s darkness demons light ii give you get a sense of where has come from its not a grinding crush of intense drones as with the music from the ambient metal groups breakout years album is more meandering and spacious steered by minimal guitar riffs that are amplified into grand aural textures is a mammoth record but its more meditative than you might expect exceptions are and the albums main sonic assaults either of these on the right soundsystem will blow your face inside out were used to hearing voices and sensing multiple personalities in the music of bug but is a solitary record it was inspired by and recorded in los ngeles and fashioned from the sense of alienation martin has said hes felt when in the states like london zoo his first album for as bug is a response to a real environment but the album feels less specific to a given city it seems instead like a parallel space one that builds an impression of some future dystopia isnt without hope duo capture that feeling on which is as close to transcendence as gets is soothing too until a noisy swell washes in disturbing the tracks stoner guitar riffs glimmers of beauty emerge throughout the album even at its most ground down ( ) and aggravated ( ) thats the message we should take away from : that hope beauty and light can be found even in the darkest spots
one of the most popular and well-respected electronic dance acts to have endured over the years is without question nick warren and jody wisternoff aka way out west having broken onto the scene back in 1994 with the initial success of ajare they continued to gain momentum with such releases as domination and the gift the release of their self-titled debut album in 1997 received much critical and popular acclaim and established the name of way out west as one to watch in the future as can often be found the follow up album to the initial successful debut can always be a hard road to travel but for way out west it was one easy ride in 2000 their second album intensify was released and once again received critical acclaim and much fanfare the album spawned singles such as the addictive intensify and the much loved mindcircus for many the later is considered one of the standout releases for 2001 especially when gabriel dresden worked their magic on it and turned it into a track that was a success across a number of genres at that point in time you really couldn t get much better now in it was once again time to give the world another dose of the way out west sound in the form of their third album release don t look now without any question this current album cements them as one of the most talented bands that excel in portraying an aspect of electronic dance music as it should be heard the album opens with the progressive breaks of anything but you and the haunting tranquility of don t forget me tracks that are both enhanced by the vocals of wow s current vocalist omi while beautifully atmospheric in feel some may find these a little commercial in sound personally i don t care because to my ears they are simply a precursor of things to come things pick up grandly with the tangerine dream sampled everyday a track that grows on me with every listen it s definitely one of those progressive tracks that has a lot of substance and absolutely no fluff it s a funny thing but every time i hear apollo i m reminded of a veritable pandora s box the start is so misleading with its sublime progressive breaks and then it opens into a completely different track once there you re lost in a sea of melodic chords and riffs with subtle but important key changes this really is a 21st century version of what future generations will come to regard as modern classical music with chasing rainbows i m instantly reminded of an early morning tide on a deserted beach its calm beats are intoxicating and the guitar riff is used as a beautiful effect fear begins with a primal beat and then sweeps into a melody that is truly enhanced by the vocals of omi a definite big room number that would lay waste to any crowded dancefloor the majestic coming home is luxurious in feel and depth this track has a somewhat breakbeat feel but its more up tempo in sound to really appreciate this track you need to hear this on a crystal clear sound system because only then can you hear all of its nuances for me just like a man is modern day torch song there s an inherent sadness to this track which can be found in its down tempo beat the sweeping soundscape only adds to its atmospheric quality the opening of killa gently creeps up on you which lends a very dramatic beginning for what lies ahead it keeps growing in tension then dips and explodes into an aural beat infused treat this is probably one of the best wow tracks i ve ever heard it just takes you to another place in your mind because its quite grand in musical scale yet has a wonderfully dark feel in melody northern lights is another track that just grows in its beats and overall sounds its another track that while containing a progressive breakbeat feel it s much more melodic in texture and depth while melt is much the same way it s a track that is very different in sound with this track the vocals are used in a way that only enhance its overall tone if you can imagine swimming through a sea of the clearest blue water this is what it would sound like the breakdown during this track is almost as if you re coming up for air when we finally reach absinthe dreams its like hearing a modern adaptation of a trip hop classic druggy languid and addictive a fitting end to an artist album that is truly beautiful not only to hear but also to experience as an added incentive way out west have also included a bonus mix cd as a part of this release there aren t many artists that would do this and for that they have my respect my intention for this review was to focus on their artist release but i can t overlook the mix that came with this while i won t be giving it my typical analytical review what i will say is that it that the mix is very enjoyable to hear while not perfect the general sound is quite infectious it s definitely a mix in which i can hear influences from both jody wisternoff and nick warren two people who as individual djs i have the utmost admiration as is expected it s progressive in sound and won t disappoint those that love the genre if anything this bonus mix has a very ethereal quality and while there are quite a few highlights the track that stands out is blue room project s out of area remixed by up and coming stars habersham and numinous jeff belfi and shane ehlers as blue room project are a producing duo to look out for and i can t wait to see what the future holds for them this is only the beginning from an overall perspective way out west s don t look now is a pleasurable and sumptuous experience this is one release that smacks of maturity and a continually growing talent pool there is not one track that i can truly find fault with each track holds a wonderfully textured quality that grabs you from beginning to end more than anything if i close my eyes i can see various djs using each track in their set that s something that i don t often find my primary focus this year has been to listen to as many artist albums as possible and as such this is one of the standouts specifically it appeals to my persona more than any other this year whether it was progressive trance breaks house whatever quite simply it s about as close to perfection that i ve heard so far this year if anything it is a release that now makes me pant for the next way out west artist album music is the most personal thing anyone can experience from my perspective my life would be empty if i didn t have the ability to discover music such as way out west s don t look now as individuals we need to encounter everything there is to experience because without these moments we are never truly complete i yearn for the music i listen to much like i crave art and literature without these things that feed my senses my ignorance would be my downfall but with them i am complete and more importantly i feel for that i will always be thankful much respect tracklisting: 1 anything but you 2 don t forget me 3 everyday 4 apollo 5 chasing rainbows 6 fear 7

oni yhun aside ep is among the finest two-trackers ive heard all year full of imagination emotion and dance floor erudition it checks just about all the boxes that youd want from a 12-inch release this is nothing new for the lebanese-born rabih eaini whose excellent releases on his own morphine records imprint and m gt;o gt;s have flown mostly under the radar for the past few years ut while you can perhaps hear why previous efforts such as dark myths of phoenicia or cetrik might have had limited crossover appeal i dont think this is the case for maybe its just wishful thinking but s and its echoing and skronking saxophone darting in front behind and inside the hook strikes me as obvious fist-pumping material eainis work will no doubt be off-putting to some but he foregrounds the melody so much so that you can likely ignore the glorious mess behind it and simply focus on the percolating melody theres even less getting in the way of whose sputtering synth is buoyed by slithering droning chords oth tunes are obviously worked over as complex as your average modular synth soup but sounds effortless always a sign that something special has occurred
the main reason why berlin label tresor was such a dominant force in techno from the early 90s onwards is because it was the first imprint to provide a platform for emerging artists from both america and europe tresor focused as much on neil landstrumm and cristian vogel as it did on daniel bell and blake baxter and succeeded in uniting a wide range of sounds the labels legacy isnt lost on berlin dj/producer of the regular acts at the new tresor club over the past few years dehnert has been putting out a hard-edged take on techno on his fachwerk label thats inspired by tresors broad heritage is a dubby building club track thats reminiscent of vintage sender berlin or pacou albeit with modern production touches like the skipping beats and rattling percussion while iv goes for a harder route led by billowing chords and chainsaw percussive sounds similarly tough beats dominate on this time they underpin a grainy acid sequence thats similar to the new seldom felt but dehnerts coup de grace is howling analogue riffs are tweaked over a tough 303 rhythm as a male vocal mutters and groans menacingly it sounds like a sleazy blake baxter getting down to the sound of a classic vogel/landstrumm noise experiment and shows that tresors new generation is still jamming all the right boxes
the bodysnatchers is the new collective name for breakbeat producers 30hz baobinga whove collaborated previously on tunes like jack your body which was released on cyberfunk records and the highly successful know ya/all in your head on supercharged the bodysnatchers moniker represents the duos efforts when they take the sounds of electro and house and translate them into breaks side v rip shit up making no allowances for subtleties rip shit up kicks off with a heavy breakbeat and a throbbing low-end bassline and hip hop vocal samples which lend themselves to the title of the tune the beats are combined with trademark 30hz percussion and baobinga drum fills for those who are familiar with their know ya tune can hear similar synth stabs and this is just the intro once the main verse kicks in an even bigger bassline drops in giving the bassbins a run for their money towards the middle they introduce a big siren like noise which progressively builds to a climax its on a similar tip to know ya but on a much darker and sinister tone side s slam pig itd be interesting to know who 30hz and baobinga have been listening to lately as slam pig is their take on progressive trance and theyve hit the nail right on the head even the beats have a four to the floor outlook with a couple of off-beat kicks and punchy snares to make sure it stays in breakbeat territory a deep driving bassline kicks in after a long intro and takes on the style that can be heard from a progressive djs set slowly the pair incorporate various trancey hooks on top until the middle breakdown where they remove it all and slowly bring it all back again it seems like theyre trying to win new fans with this one fans of the hard house persuasion
the two tracks on this split 12 inch between veteran producer and newcomer complement each other rather well s is a frenetic electro cut with a fine contrast between scuzzy and slick textures grainy bassline and the kind of distorted vocal s always utilised so well are pitted against chrome plated percussion and smooth pads s has its share of oddness sax tones and bird sounds are thankfully uncommon in modern dance music but used here to accent the serpentine bassline and stark drum clatter they work the track pushes and pulls: around the middle the elements drop off to reveal just the percussive skeleton and that bird whistle before the bassline returns the groove is immersive but unstable so although s track initially seems more predictable it throws you just as much as s

given that s mo as both a club night and a label has been predicated on risk-taking and experimentation the frazzled house of s latest ep for the berlin label is notably accessible davison a london-based irishman has a love of classic soul and theo parrish and he combines these influences across three uplifting sun-dappled tracks the eps most forceful moment announces its arrival with thudding kicks slivers of looped vocals and generous dollops of sub-bass before scuttling off into the distance with clanking percussion davison cites daphni as inspiration but theres a hint of scubas big-room raucousness here the jaunty analogue space-funk of is a departure with its traces of french house and thievery corporation but is the winner here a blissful slab of twinkling mid-tempo house for its first three minutes it jolts you out of your reverie when davison detonates a charge of quaking bass underneath it
family is a big influence in dance music: often youll hear djs and producers name check their parents older siblings and other family members for helping expose them to the underground for the first time in the case of his first solo release is indebted to the man he helped give him his start nearly 20 years ago omar-s dj mix the duo made in 1992 was recently released on cd on fxhe it featured plenty of vocal house jams from that era that went on to become anthems but this release is planted firmly in todays underground deep house music the first cut nigga is a deep and abstract afterhours jam that uses subtle melodic touches to work its way into your psyche buckle up is a more uptempo dance floor track but still has the sensibilities of classic detroit house strick pays tribute to the west side of detroit with a track that originally appeared on a fxhe compilation on beatport its been a long wait to get it on wax but its worth it: its the highlight of the ep smooth synth flourishes reverberate over a bubbling bassline to create a classic somewhat more rough sounding mix of is the base for a sampled dialogue about growing up as a young black man on nd rounding out the ep is the lo-fi rumble of doe which is reminiscent of some of the grittier omar-s tracks ll in all a fine first release that will be a staple in the crates of the deep and nasty house-loving djs out there
anonymity is almost impossible these days it seems saw burial reveal himself basic channel and underground resistance became regular fixtures on the festival circuit and wolfgang voigts moves were covered on these pages almost daily the myspace generation clearly forcing all and sundry to come out of hiding fortunately not quite all: the shadowy have been beavering away in obscurity since 2001 releasing untitled tracks in text-free none-blacker vinyl-only editions no information available aside from gushing blurbs on the kompakt website ( totally exciting new techno from berlin drexcia-inspired genius druggy stuff ) in a culture currently collapsing from promotion-overload this information-void is particularly appealing and s clunky brand of techno only adds to the charm brazenly hand-crafted functional but with little interest in fads or genre conventions this is weird stuff it sounds like the product of berghain mated with profan: dark reverb-dunked rhythms lost in pools of tape hiss divergent patterns causing further confusion crudely sampled patches of static is marcel dettmann meets marcel marceau; punishing but with tongue-in-cheek and a playful glint in its eye if t raumschmiere is technos punk-rock then is its no wave the cd features 14 tracks most of them around five minutes in length which gives the tunes the feel of studies or experiments of the sort found on old sound library collections simple themes are quickly established then quickly discarded the opening track is a waltz a strauss lollipop loping in dank dubstep terrain until track 2 stomps in offering a beautifully hackneyed take on minus minimal the trademark claves and congas lazily daubed in charcoal loops of hiss bleed into ghostly warning tones in track 5 pseudo latin rhythms stumbling over clattering electro breaks while track 7 loses grand trance themes in thick fog pads and drums distorting bleeding into the surrounding mist the palate remains firmly monochromatic all dub techno greys draped over minimal drum patterns but the manner in which these buckle twisting into surprisingly obtuse forms lends vitality to these simple pieces the warped arpeggios which stagger zombie-like all over track 6 are stunning and would surely send crowded floors into a frenzy track 8 is just as cocky with tambourines and gushing strings cycling like the field track 10 re-examines the riff from supermayers two of us submerging it in darker waters and throwing in ragged jazz breaks to disrupt the flow calmer pieces recall rechenzentrum or mikkel metal with stoned rhythms lurching around dying dub pulses and barbed synth pads theres not a bum note in sight or rather the bum notes are so artfully deployed that each track develops skewed and eccentric personalities absent from all but the most innovative of modern productions
the pairing of italian artists donato dozzy and marco shuttle is packed with potential dozzys extensive output has included plenty of fruitful collaborations and shuttles patient long-form approach comes across as easily accommodating (see: his killer time to express track sing like a bird and peter van hoesens just-as-potent remix) the duos first record as sounds like a safe but logical initial effort both and are crisp modern acid techno running around seven minutes apiece and exploring the tweaked-out possibilities of a single synth line atop sparse shivering percussion whose asymmetrical 303 riff murmurs sharply as it stretches into open space has a darker more cosmic vibe is mellower thanks to a warmer almost meditative lead its also faster and with intensifying rushes of cymbals and hi-hats a little more self-contained subtle easy-to-layer acid tracks like these will always be welcome but hopefully the future will bring some more eclectic experiments from this project
several months after their impressive debut yum records returns with a three-track ep that stays true to its london roots claus is one half of the team behind toi toi a party that since 2010 has established itself a reputation as one of the capitals go-to spots for forward-thinking house and techno on the flip arguably the citys foremost purveyor of late-night oddities fabric resident craig pitches in with a rare remix regulars at toi toi will know s sets for their meandering minimal aesthetic which is reflected on interlude archives ep prominent basslines underpin both tracks allowing to experiment with varying textures and techniques the more stripped-back of the two makes a feathery atmosphere of garbled mutterings and distant knocks is more cunning masquerading initially as a slice of sharp-edged techno before a lengthy improvised jazz breakdown reveals s musical side both would fit well in the nether regions of an a:rpia:r or ricardo villalobos set same could be said of the flip which sees update to suit his tougher trippier tastes with the kind of bassline thatll stay with you for days his remix rounds out a head-turning follow-up from the yum camp
peter presta goes head to head with little carlos to deliver the next release on recordings the original of is featured alongside a bryan cox mix first up though is the original mix and i must say it certainly lacks a bit of cutting edge the track does display some good drum patterns but it s in other areas of the production where things are lacking to help make it that something a little bit special the bryan cox mix turns up the pace quite a fair bit and adds a fair bit to the release the drums and percussion are quite intense and the baselines are nicely tuned into the production gritty in its approach yet funky in its delivery this mix helps save this release from the mediocre bin check out the b-side for the finer moments of this release as it is quite a quality remix from bryan cox
cio dors die faser will likely stand as the totemic moment when headfuck techno vaulted further into the mainstream discussion of dance music its the first long-form exploration of the sound attacking it from a number of angles the subject of this first salvo from the album is one of the best a warm and flowing track that is bustling with tiny field recordings that imbue it with a live feeling that so much similar work lacks warm and flowing pretty much describes donato s career and the italian producer thusly turns up with two takes on dors the first a beatless version focuses its attention on the naked piano and longing synths that provided the underpinning for the original like much of s output it scrapes alongside the dangerous coastline of goudaville but somehow ends up running aground in tasteful town the reason his ship is steered so expertly the answer probably lies in the other remix you can tell that s bona fides are very real from his techno version of the tune an eight-and-a-half minute journey into deep bleeps he clearly gets his kicks from ambience like the first but when it comes time to drop the hammer hes all too happy to bring four beats every measure
their best were simply unbeatable y set so many standards that its almost impossible to imagine how dance music would sound without them y made some of the greatest house records of all time and entire sub genres sprang out of their ideas this four disc collection is a potent reminder of their best work and if you believe what they said in their ra exchange a precursor to new music in 2015 y compilation with is sure to be worthy of your attention this one neatly encapsulates what did best: a smoky house beat joyous vocal per mance and instantly emotive chords meld to create something totally irresistible ts a simple combination but one these guys did better than anyone else many of their most loved records and t to name another two built these seemingly simple elements into something infinitely more than the sum of their parts arguably s biggest contribution to dance music was their evolution of the remix way they could trans m pass pop records into dance floor gold was at once remarkable and revolutionary their hands mick hucknall could become a house diva thus their enduring remix of s made their name as sonic alchemists flipping the shittiest pop records into underground anthems that so much of their work was major labels goes someway to explain why so much is missing from : much of it simply may have been too expensive to license dub of trey lorenzs photograph mary an n c anthem and building block of uk garage is not included r is the dub of s e step ahead s first major label remix and one that marked a pivotal moment in their career course it would have been impossible to include everything ie vega and kenny gonzalez made over 1 500 records together but these dubs are arguably the tracks that feel most relevant today still theres enough on to keep you happy s ly r and are about as good as soulful house music can get f you dont already own these records you need this compilation
doesnt fuck around as you could guess from titles like ghettoblaster and for professional dj use only the detroit producers music is defined by an upfront no-frills mentality that and the roland 303 wilson has a knack for wailing acid lines and his records are splattered with them hes churned out some massive tracks over the past few years most notably 2009s this love a spooky acid banger that remains a dj favorite today a double-pack wilson says is influenced and dedicated to all those who have worked and lived underground might be his biggest and baddest yet has two different modes: banging but groovy and utterly brutal the first record packs in two extended blistering techno cuts fast relentless and slightly demented in the same vein as i-fs classic i do because i couldnt care less but as confrontational as they are both tracks are deceptively catchy the drum patterns are just funky enough and there are infectious quasi-melodies embedded in their sandpaper textures wilson lightens up on the second record but only a bit the a-side begins with eight bars of a shrill arpeggio then drops abruptly into a chugging deep house groove bongos mellow chords and claps but with a nervous urgency thats pure techno the a2 sinks those chords deep in the mix and brings back the first records corroded textures but it keeps things at a medium boil the b-side plays a similar track to the erupting into a heavy groove after an eight-bar intro but here the energy is more ferocious thanks to fierce hi-hats a huge bassline and a simple acid hook is nothing fancy just five no-bullshit club weapons as dirty and raucous as they come
the glasgow trio of iain cook martin doherty and lauren mayberry occupy a sweet spot in dance-leaning pop music: they skirt maudlin sentiment in radical ways on a single from sophomore album every open eye the bands synths have dimmed from the usual times square-like flash mayberry casts more shade over the song in her lyrics telling an ex-lover take care to leave a trace of a man where she often seemed to float over the music she digs right into the glassy latticed melodies of in doing so deliver one of their most rousing and anthemic songs four who normally has great form remixing records like this turns in an underwhelming version the first couple of minutes are a jumble of matte synths and homespun melodies which all seems to promise a there is love in you -style coda what we get instead is an overlong break filled with clunky samples of mayberry clattering ungracefully over each other and then a slightly bass-loaded reprise of the intro given the quality of source material its a surprise he didnt do more
with pedigree like this youd be surprised if the music wasnt ace paul ritch and djulz have respectively rolled and snapped their way to the respect of those who appreciate a more refined serious style of dance music veteran 2000 and has amongst his accolades a serpentine and popular remix of djulzs just so you know and visionquest meanwhile is shaun reeves ryan crosson lee curtiss and seth troxler what you get is a tough 12-inch with a quirky remix by the latter crew with all tracks being of a classic standard is high-energy combining a rapid choppy acoustic tech house drum programming with a sturdy techno kick a restless sub monobass and an unhinged twittering that takes over the room creating a bizarre and overbearingly heady atmosphere its extremely recognisable partly due to its bright intrusiveness; but also because its equally as characteristic 2000s mix does what it says on the tin with no messing around: the track is made by the stuttering voice of a mechanised sentinel which evokes scenes from terminator of a machine-ruled future fruity naive synth lines flop around the shiny upper regions of the spectrum in the visionquest mix while a loose springy analogue bass resonates its riff in lolloping fashion drums sit halfway between electronic and recorded offering toughness diluted with screwloose clatter you can almost see the cartoon bluebirds circling your head
james mowbray must not get much sleep he is an editor at mixmag he is a promoter he is a dj and yet he still finds time to make music that never hints at fatigue his second release on four:twenty is likewise full of energy: produced with studio buddy leiam sullivan is an uplifting house number whose fluttering melodies and euphoric waves lull you into a sense of bliss that is until a wall of bass gets poured into the mix surprisingly this heavy-handed tactic only enhances the hypnotic quality of the track and when it s finished you feel better for the journey on the b-side copenhagen art-djs ink take the track to detroit focusing on simple stabs of melody and rumbling kicks to create a nice minimal techno effort worthy of any large sound stage it does lose clarity though when the fluttering melodies of the original get added to the tougher framework but luckily for us there is a second remix which doesn t include the flowery synths leaving only techno goodness dmittedly these tracks did nothing for me on first listen they seemed like mid-nineties throwbacks rehashing themselves for an unknown audience but after a few plays their uniqueness peeks through this uniqueness has become a trademark of four:twenty and mowbray and sullivan don t let the team down one bit
might just polarize the loyal fan base of hern n catt neo the melancholy prog of his two master series comps gained him a rabid following the world over and rightfully so: his deep bass tribal drums and haunting samples made many a listener to gank a derek howell title off masters series vol 2 happy to be sad and while catt neo hasnt quite abandoned his trademark sound is a hip-shaker whether thats for better or worse will be up to the fans disc one starts surprisingly with gui boratto laying down a fat slab of minimal goodness typical of kompakt on arquipelago this segues beautifully into the oliviero mos remix of peterskys fuck them all a nicely twisted track thats not half as mean-spirited as it sounds dousk makes a welcome appearance halfway through with the dreamy and floaty florence which is truly beautiful (despite my lame choice of adjectives) but paolo mojos 1983 is an infuriating inclusion: the daft punk-like tinkling synths and the early 90s house piano make for a real throwaway of a track the worst however has to be with my friends by randall jones presents djs set you free the beat is nice and eerie but the straight-up track after track of hotness vocal is lame wigger talk that makes the whole thing laugh-out-loud horrible luckily phonique and erlend ye are there to pick up the pieces with the catt neo tonks remix of for the time being though i vastly preferred monteros dub off dave seamans masters series vol 7 disc two reminds me of the second disc of global underground 014: hong kong as both digweed and catt neo plumb the darker depths of progressive house with the same solid sleaze catt neo kicks off with bushwacka s beastman a monstrous track that chews up a sample from leftfields dusted over a malevolent bassline but destiny by 16 bit lolitas is where the second disc really starts to get filthy with heavy doses of pounding rhythm squelchy bass and scattered claps the remix of mehta riedel s stripped-down obsessions sounds like tribal warfare but the highlight of has to be the pushers scorching version of dan weltons lisopain which is straight-up hotness equally at home at a sultry outdoor rave or at the movies when the hero is chased through the jungle by enraged natives catt neo polishes off the disc with sirocco his and john tonks follow-up to the immortal introspective breaks of warsaw its a hard act to follow and they dont quite pull it off but the track is still a nice prog house roller uplifting and cool without being cheesy or pretentious hern n catt neo s mixing and sequencing are predictably superb but his track selection leaves something to be desired suffers from the same problem as seamans masters series: one cd is face-meltingly rad the other merely so-so seamans disc one was nearly perfect while catt neos disc two is the half that truly soars taken as a whole the biggest disappointment of is the track selection: the tracks seesaw between gemstones and coals and its hard to keep your finger off the skip button
four years ago youd never in your life guess this peppy thing however dark its tonality and precise its production had come from kode9 and the spaceape thats how far dubstep has traveled theres something calm about this record that fits its position in between so many other tracks that kode9 clearly tasked himself with making sound definitive this is a corner piece not a center one that doesnt make it any less lovely t about two minutes we get the silvery synth wash fans will remember this device the first time one of them announced itself to me that sudden sheet of impenetrable gleaming sound that cut the track at a completely different angle than i was anticipating was of course on a signal release by kode9s label hyperdub rusties remix of zombys spliff dub and it nearly split my brain open kode9s version of it is far finer laser-like; it illuminates corners of the track more than it disrupts them that it seems to announce itself as a variation on a theme effective though it is cant help but say something about the way eruptions eventually settle themselves down
hardware-built house is certainly nothing new and (jean brazeau) isnt pretending that it is the vancouver dj/producers first outing for is a collection new age-inspired dance music with an urge to jack borrowing as much from 808 state as mr fingers nearly all six productions balance a languid atmosphere with busy drums swaggering basslines and sumptuous melodies brazeau seems to know exactly what hes doing with this material and he keeps inspired and exciting despite its roots in well-worn sounds some records best tracks feature live instruments (or an approximation re ) which gives brazeau a chance to show f his soulful melodic touch the rhodes in appears during tunes quiet breakdown and its burnt chords lend it some heartfelt punctuation before launching into finale delivers exactly what its title promises a wistful floor-filler with exuberant saxophone the instrumentation in of is all retro-digital synth pads and blasted 909s but brazeau injects satisfying musicality with his casual keyboard flourishes its a rare moment when celestial vibe grows tiresome but once of the comes on at track five beatless nearly eight-minute piece feels somewhat laborious the slow drift does eventually pay f though acting as a sort extended intro to understated closer a s t-focus production mist haze caps f brazeaus debut release like its reminiscing on previous 30 minutes music

active since the early 90s lived the gritty new york dance history that label references his production career continued into the minimal years and he now works as a mastering engineer (with among his clients) but his 90s-era techno energetic trippy often pretty aggressive sounds more current now than it has at any time since it was produced a collection of tracks that have languished on dats for years is the proof this is strange menacing techno hard when it needs to be and weird in all right places it could have been made last week is the most energetic quick-stepping along in the high 130s scratchy hi-hats and acrid piano chords seem to be constantly skipping free of the bassline snarl beneath them occasionally it all stops for a booming electro breakdown before picking up the chase again is caustic electro its synth and voice stabs throbbing like an infected wound s atonal synth loops could be jeff mills-style brain melting if the whole thing had a bit more pace schoenemann takes the patient approach bleeding in bongo syncopations and eardrum-tickling high-end for a disorientating climax closer reboot demonstrates that schoenemann can do deep with just as much flair this is tribal techno for the comedown with gorgeous synth pads wandering thoughtfully across the frequency spectrum before stealing into the night
i met henry keen in cuba last year where he and his brother ollie were putting together a collaboration with the local band ache meyi for manana festival he like everyone was out of his comfort zone there working with minimal equipment tight deadlines and a language barrier collaboration which has since been released on the manana label ended up being one of the festivals best second full ep under his alias finds him on home turf even more so than 2015s homemade waves ep healing scaphoids sounds warm relaxed and comfortable in its own skin keen is a 70s baby as a recent album title put it and his music tracks the soul funk and jazz of the era via turn-of-the-millennium dance developments: deep house and crucially west london broken beat drum kits are warm and roomy replete with claps and clicks sidesticks and woody kick drums basslines are casual but firm while synths burble and coo like happy birds keen also keeps things loose structurally key motifs tend to sidle gently in and out of frame as with the keys referenced in the title of or the chord changes in the latter half of both of those tracks lope forwards on syncopated kick drums but things straighten out with the dreamy 4/4 of though its percussion twitches and swings as if trying to break free from its gentle straitjacket unsettled feeling persists on where the clap and chords sit just before the two and four unbalancing the groove a broken beat trick made new
early in his long and productive career justin k broadrick despised genre the way anarcho-punks despise the capitalist state for the young radical from birmingham the concept was a form of sonic ghettoization that had to be overthrown he waged his revolt through a string of collaborative and solo projects that approached desegregation with all the subtlety of a molotov cocktail the pioneering godflesh was born out of a high-impact collision between heavy metal and industrial; techno animal violently collapsed hip-hop ambient and noise together; the sidewinder unleashed a crust-smeared splicing of hard techno repetition and blown-out african groove from jesu to (an older alias reactivated with 2012s posthuman ) subverting genre remains the bedrock of broadricks vision today as hes grown older his means of achieving it have become decidedly nuanced hes no longer breaking down barriers and reveling in chaos so much as hes constructing sustainable interfaces between the sounds and styles hes explored since the late 80s its certainly true of the wild forceful meticulous double-lp released on speedy js label the record features plenty of broadricks trademarks: brontosaurus-sized beats sheets of static and the tension between animalistic intensity and mechanized determinacy the latter quality plays a vital role in the first two tracks recalls techno animals programmed crunch even as it sounds like an industrial-metal band is even more gnarly nailing the sweet spot between militant repetition and a troglodyte rock stomp despite the sheer enormity of s grooves the music retains a refreshing kineticism thanks to a nimble minimalist touch of syncopation a veteran with drum breaks broadrick possesses a far deeper well of rhythmic schemes than many of his brooding peers in the industrial electronic zone stands out for that reason: had the track come out in the late 90s its steamship hiss counterpoint percussion and lurching swagger wouldve aligned it with experimental hip-hop on broadrick sends that inimitable swagger through an obstacle course of jarring pivots as crud-caked synths move double-time through great billows of distortion even on the albums most technoid cut broadrick splatters drum corp-style toms snares and cymbals against a metronomic pulse the result is a kind of murky ominous industrial-grade robo-funk the severe crunchy production and impenetrable distortion of has a lot in common with the likes of andy stott (namely passed me by and we stay together ) and ancient methods at his most beastly but in terms of emotion their foreboding music stands apart from its a rare musician who could make music this bleak sound utterly engrossing
2011 keita sadanaga wood frame rinth 20 groundin
belongs to one of bristols most low-key crews fallingup alongside ndy mac and typesun hes nonetheless responsible for one of the finest singles to come from the citys house wave: 2012s try slung a detroit deep house number whose sunkissed simplicity was perfectly judged jays long overdue return to brstl is a little less dazzling the arrangements are more refined and the mood in classic fallingup style is humble to a fault nonetheless it contains a pair of pleasant deep house soaks ge is all about the gently compulsive swing that animates its toy-like percussion crisp snares and hi-hats scuff against easy-chair rhodes chords generating a charm disproportionate to the subdued mood is spicier as pistoning hi-hats give it a welcome energy boost its rhodes figures climb tirelessly up and down the chromatic ladder before fizzing out prettily in the breakdown when the whole thing snaps back into focus the synths are different and fractionally steelier a subtle sleight of hand but an effective one
nearly two years after its release continues to issue remixes from onur zers debut album for the imprint when the ones doing the remixing are isol e and aby though theres hardly reason to complain oth work very slowly at each and every thing that comes out their door meticulously crafting masterpieces of sound production sometimes that gets in the way of musical enjoyment most notably in isol es less-than-warmly received 12-inch for diynamic earlier this year (which r incidentally liked ) ut unlike that release his take on zers suffers from no lack of discernible groove instead the issue here is thats all there seems to be isol e drafts out the main hook and rides it until it breaks tweaking it ad infinitum and offering new elements every so often to liven things up its a curiously restrained bit of material from the producer and one that doesnt quite hit as a result that same sort of minimalism is present in aby s remix of ida but its spooky vocal atmospheres and endlessly chattering percussion cohere to produce something that is more effectively hypnotic its full of the sonic detail that isol e provides but the hook is smoothed out into a lengthy drone letting the complexity breath rather than forcing things to happen simply trusts in his loops to deliver the goods luckily they very much do
ive never been to china i only know what the west is telling me about china recently told pitchfork while discussing her debut album that cultural disconnect is the central tenet of a record that takes the listener on a journey through imagined china the country as portrayed in western media aims to expand on sinogrime a loose thread of grime where artists who knew very little about china clumsily appropriated eastern scales and instrumentation for al qadiri that means taking her streamlined beats and embellishing them with an array of mallet percussion midi string instruments and self-consciously asian-sounding melodies if that sounds like cultural appropriation well thats kind of the point the bigger question is whether the music itself holds up the record begins with a haunting cover of nothing compares 2 u called the chinese term for pirated goods the lyrics are written in nonsense mandarin rendering what sounds like a heartfelt performance from fung ultimately meaningless but even with a haughty introduction settles into a zone that sounds a whole lot like al qadiris past eps desert strike and genre specific xperience those (excellent) 12-inches sounded like grime with its innards scooped out here al qadiri adds an exotic topcoat to those ominous basslines and creeping synths lending the whole thing a sinister and grandiose undertone each track on corresponds to a different region or idea the disembodied vocals and fluid synths on hint at the mythology of the historically spiritual mountain range the plasticky pomp of reconciles its namesakes imperial history with its current status as a glitzy tourist destination uses a swift mallet melody to convey the vastness of chinas open roads most striking of all is which portrays one of chinas fastest-growing cities once a tiny village now has a reputation for abundant prosperity living next to seedy crime the same economic imbalance that inspired grime in london in the first place as such is also the most straightforward uk-style tune on the record and it proves that al qadiri can nail a club cut when she wants to those are all killer tracks even when you remove the context which makes the chinese flourishes feel gimmicky the problem with is that it doesnt go much deeper than merely pointing out that this unrealistic vision of china exists theres no greater commentary or anything useful to take away from it and at some level it could be considered offensive dressing up surface-level appropriation as something smarter sounds better when heard as an experimental grime album and left at that you certainly dont need to know anything about china to enjoy it and maybe thats the key: the lp positions al qadiri as just one in a long line of grime producers finding inspiration in the same problematic yet awe-inspiring vision of the east
if i ever manage to moonwalk (not the mj thing) i might well choose the a side to as the soundtrack its not so much that it has a stereotypical cosmic feel; its just that the synths are so drained of colour as to be dead lifeless space incarnate is a label from madrid and the founder leads off the release with an icy number punctuated by blipping transmissions hi hats and the accompanying cymbal taps never try to establish a charged rhythm with the sparse bassline the three float weightlessly about bumping gently into one another before moving off to their next collision it might have been a plain track but for a chirping cricket like noise which appears at unexpected times in bloodless synths again play a large part but this time theyre more like bridges rather than a canvas its a little reminiscent of zadigs oo_d from june; hook focussed with an emphasis on effects motif isnt as strong though; its really the tracks shifting backdrop which makes the whole thing worthwhile b side is awarded to another spaniard a fairly typical slice of dub sets about restoring some vibrancy to the record however where similar tracks can take on a viscous even sluggish feel has a lighter quality; its spangled chords sailing above the striding bassline finishes the task; a joyful and unexpected ditty given the airlessness found elsewhere on the record taking a seemingly endless number of crystalline chimes and gleeful arps cycles methodically between them for some it might slip too far into syrupy sweetness for others the twanging analogue bass and faint sense of euphoria will be irresistible
i ve never seen him live but after hearing fabriclive 34 it s plain to see why has nabbed breakspoll s best award three years in a row his track selection casts a wide net in all directions but his mixing remains clean tight while also leaving ample room for turntable trickery interventions while his debut artist album from last year was overproduced overly soft s fabriclive 34 is a potent blend of laidback vibes upfront breaks with most importantly a good sense of humor something that s been lacking in the series lately is called in for hosting duties here but after also kicking off the scratch perverts fabriclive 22 their watch ride mix from earlier this year a shift from obligatory mic controllers is in order from dyna s intro we re treated to a tasty acapella of of the s hip hopper i m over the beat by contemporary ss effective is the rap classic cut with s breaks stormer still does manage some er crafty under the radar looping tempo raising to kick his mix into full breaks mode from there on out the head of the pack is by a bitch slap to techno thus ironically most of the fellow fabric series makes a poor choice of follow up with s breaks : drive at five breaks that can only bring to mind a stripe shirted b t tool raising his smirnoff ice to the track s sole hook: it s the weeeeeeeek eeeeeeeend s vip mix of goes a long way in making it heavier more danceable than the minimal funkin original segue of sirens transitions it beautifully into the album s best track s which only further cements them as the best producers in breaks period takin salsa dances out of breakbeat before whisks in s mash up of s new wave classic him with s booty bouncing vocal from wizard s in the but the best part is s devastating slam into the m remix of by : absolute dancefloor wreckage s e is a sour moment toward the end with vocalist doing his best ludacris impression since poor breaks producers probably can t afford the real thing s use of s 94 cut y as the album closer doesn t work quite as well as he imagined either as it feels like something you d hear as the lights go up while doing the bitter/drunk/comedown shuffle toward the exits the very least though it ll inspire you to throw the album in for another spin that s the beauty of this particular fabriclive : it feels like a genuine night out at a show but one you can relive again again
part of what was impressive about dan snaiths jiaolong was the number of indie-dude-does-dance-album pitfalls it didnt fall into there was no excessive focus on melody no hangdog confessions no lack of groove or fun the latest single from snaiths daphni project is a collaboration with another established indie figure owen pallett and it complicates things wonderful as it can be its difficult to think of anything less suited to a dance floor transposition than palletts brand of fiddly symphonic pop nor is there much call for a violin in the club (outside of a philly string section that is) fortunately these two tracks arent nearly as offensive as they couldve been i mean yes rendering a uk funky-style semitonal melody on a real violin rather than a brash synth-string patch as these two do on does miss the point a little but snaiths oddball techno backing more or less makes up for it while a periodic upward swooping bassline shows his intimate knowledge of dance floor mechanics is odder but less coherent pallett supplies a bunch of effects scratchy stepladder melodies glowering drones glissandi which are laid out in succession over a heads-down techno beat at times the combination is impressively pungent at others kind of annoying snaith is maybe best off forging ahead on his own but this is an intriguing detour along the way

unlike electronic music designed for dancing where micro-scenes become a kind of cultural ideology for the groups that gather in their temples by night electronica is less inclined to pursue agendas with the exception of the artificial intelligence series on warp in the early nineties which brought together aphex autechre and plaid to define the template for electronic listening music its trajectory has been dictated by a series of idiosyncratic producers or labels a boards of canada here a jan jelinek there perhaps its this lack of agenda that has turned 25-year-old london producer back to electronic musics earliest incarnations on his third album his first for herb following releases on scottish electronica stalwart benbucula as the tongue-in-cheek title suggests references to the early dabblings of composers like xenakis and edgard var se abound bbc radiophonic workshop legend derbyshire is among those that marchment explicitly references in his sampling of 40s 50s and 60s oddities repainting them in figurative shapes to suit ears raised on the glitch and crunch of more contemporary structures the woozy analogue textures that result frequently recall boards of canada especially in the gorgeous opener which builds a patina of textures of barely perceptible difference to express a simple melody likewise squeezes dusty electronics through the tube to spit out chunky exotic machine funk named after the author of the futurist manifesto shares its namesakes embrace of the disorientating potential of technology like a soundtrack to losing control of your car it evokes the thrill and uncertainty of the new less successful are the albums more generic moments; while pretty fails to take root in the subconscious in quite the same way as which follows it with a bonkers deconstruction of stuttering dubstep if marchment is a little too conscious of his forbears even those most producers struggle to pronounce the vision that begins to take shape on this record is one of a music that probes the possibilities of a digital language founded on the eccentricities of its analogue past whos afraid is at its best when this interplay is instinctive when the memories of the future flow most fluently
for a minute there few producers in the us underground were as prolific as jason letkiewicz recording either as steve summers confused malvoeaux lan hurst sensual eings or death commando he was one of the cornerstone acts on l i e s doing dusty analog jams that could veer into house techno or even horror soundtracks with ease ut the man fell silent the past three years and only came back into view early this year with his death commando project now letkiewicz revives his dormant alias and returns to the label that released his first seven-inch eight years ago coinciding with max ds long-delayed oost and will dimaggios fusion ( roadcast mix) (a contender for track of the summer) this 12-inch could get lost in the mix dont let it as both sides prove letkiewiczs sensibilities remain whetted opens with a tough kick and hi-hat combo that brings to mind the spiky disco-punk patterns of df s remix of le tigres deceptacon the track quickly jumps into a heady new space however adding deft touches of chimes and bells that suggest a zooted mindstate even as things chug along and gather steam moves deeper into that cloudy zone: sluggish murky strange subliminal barely-there murmur propels the track it never shakes the haze (an effect that brings to mind early terekke) as it moves with queasy chords only a steady ride cymbal keeping it grounded its an effective and mysterious track that will hopefully mean theres more to come from one of letkiewiczs numerous aliases

is undeniably one of the finest producers in australia at this moment to use an overabused term everything he seems to touch turns to gold is another masterpice from luke and its a long overdue release for receiving massive airplay from the likes of ben korbel locally to john digweed internationally for the last year and a half the original mix gets a release with a fantastic addition on the flip in a breaks rework on the a-side is the original mix a track which featured on ben korbel trent anthony s kiss fm mix in early 2002 some dark 4/4 beats and drums begin the track as whistles and bird like sounds fade in and out at a very low volume slowly but surely soothing wailing effects roll in and out of the track and the drums build as the overall outlook builds in momentum the track starts to reach its climax deep into the record as all the elements; drums subtle synths wildlife and little eerie effects all meet to produce a brilliant production by arguably one of the finest producers in australia as we speak on the flip is the very unique midnight in cyberfunk remix this is quite simply a stunning rework of the original by luke the track takes a more breaky approach but what is clear as well is that there are almost 2 separate tunes in one the first half of the track is almost completely different to the latter half the track builds with a solid beat pattern and effects fading in and out and also some nicely arranged melodies later on the track however takes a turn for the twisted halfway in as a vicious baseline takes control and the beats become more erratic in an enticing way a high-pitched electro melody also gains power in the track as the pieces in the puzzle blend to produce a creepy result one of the finest productions this year so far needless to say this is an essential purchase both mixes do the damage luke strikes again
jump up drumnbass fans would instantly recognize the name of having previously worked on urban takeover releases with aphrodite and mickey finn and also being credited with the first remix of a fatboy slim track - rockafeller skank now hes back on doing both the nu-skool breaks thing and a drumnbass track as well side a listen to the basstone rolling breakbeats and a very heavy but catchy bassline should be an instantly recognisable melody once it gets played in clubs the snare drums sound long and stretched out like a drumnbass 45 being slowed down to 33rpm it works well and is definitely a must for any fans of thumping breaks tunes side b rub my boomstick back to his drumnbass guise which we all knew him for rub my boomstick is s take on vandals classic track boomstick from last year if youve heard the original then youll remember it is a deep and dark breaks tune with some nice bass stabs and samples from evil dead 3 - army of darkness s take on it is not really jump up and sounds a bit more like what ram records and tru playaz artists are doing nowadays - crisp rolling breaks with tight snares stabby kick drums lots of percussion heavy bass and plenty of build ups to get the crowds going wild personally it doesnt seem to have the oomph that the original version has and sounds better at around 130 bpms instead of 175 its good to see embrace drumnbass like they do with breaks and maybe this realease will open up new doors for new artists to come through for people who really are into both drumnbass and breaks then this release is a must have for fans of releases then listen to the basstone will suit and should get a crowd jumping
even before its fledgling scene was decimated by mounting police pressure bassline never got much attention from electronic music media maybe it was sound itself all dance music is functional but its hard to imagine anything more so than this specific blend of swung 4/4 beats and garagey bass wobbles is one producer who always stuck true to form with 2008s wot he had one of scenes few bona fide an ms after a brief hiatus he returned with a number of great singles on labels like unknown to unknown and latter outfit has just released s debut album it seems strange that this torch-bearer for a sorely under-represented scene should make an album so unashamedly pop re will be a large contingent of fans that will hear and immediately accuse of selling out just as re is any time an artist starts making music with mass appeal this would be an unfair reaction isnt sound of someone sticking to a formula for a quick buck if anything its most daring record has ever put out unfortunately that doesnt mean its any good shows q playing around with multiple genres and sounds and end result is simply missing raw grittiness that his fans loved re are a few tracks where its nearly re at points feels like trademark q but its peppered with a trancey euphoria that just feels cheesy - is less bassline than it is trappy dubstep a strong vocal performance from cant save from feeling like a weak todd edwards track and has to be among most saccharine drum bass tracks ever produced watered down breaks for peak moments in festival sets thats not to say re are no high points dubstep swagger and foreboding bass of manages to cut through sickly sweet synths in background and is pure rolling ukg at his finest is ano r strong dubsteppy number this time with bizarre vocals from jayjayborntosing and it might be a london sounding lad ranting with little attempt at reaching any pitch or melody but it works and it would comfortably be albums highlight if it wasnt for casual misogyny pouring out of every line sees take a swing at something new this approach should be applauded and could even win him some new fans but its safe to say i wont be one of m
theres a group of french producers who are threatening to oust the dauphins of distortion from their current throne in a revolutionary return to their countrys ancien regime of house jef k and chris carrier are noteworthy conspirators in the gathering though the resolutely dependable is also a key combatant against the noise which has been drowning out an active and commendable scene ever since daft punk bought leather jackets and justice crossed the waters of nazareth the man behind is no great innovator his records owe evident dues to dj sneaks technique and work samples plucked from a familiar pool though he is very good at what he does always jacking always funky rarely cornball variety not really but thats ok when you consider almost any track from his discography could be selected practically by roulette and your set would be better off for it with that in mind you know pretty much what to expect from a funk loop added bass cowbell the classic ingredients that knows to blend adeptly the vocal track about spreading the house vibe party time spoken in a thick gallic accent (presumably part of the revolutionary propaganda) is a bit much but with an instrumental version included alongside a dubbed-out ghetto mix theres little reason not to follow marianne all the way to the discotheque

techno is best understood as a design problem: how do you build a track with the fewest possible elements jpls and ambivalent tackle this question by returning to the days of daniel bells blip and beep pegging each song on s to a single eponymous sound offers a decent loop with a thundering kick drum and a wavering synthesizer that slowly drifts into the foreground but not much else happens the action is on where a fat keyboard stab is coaxed into a wide-swinging chorus that chops and rolls across a peppy drum kit you can feel the effect of each knob being nudged as the sound breathes and growls across the top and bottom of your speakers performs a similar trick pairing a badass snarl with a purring high-end that marries the best elements from jpls and ambivalents solo efforts ( activatroy and nugget ) the digital version of s is bundled with two filler tracks is basically in reverse with a curved tone dragging across the drums yet the effect is more cartoonish than its forward-facing counterpart theres a moment in jplss remix of the same track when the skittering percussion evokes the mad energy of plastikmans 1993 classic spastik without coming anywhere close to its physical shock i found myself worrying that fifteen years later minimal techno has become a formal exercise rather than a futuristic genre defined by gutsy invention fortunately the raw grind of and keeps this nagging concern at bay

this single is s first release since the brilliant fabric 63 arguably the crowning moment of the new york producers steady rise to fame that mix was veritably crammed with exclusives all of them as you might expect excellent so its high time one found its way onto wax one of the mixs understated highlights is about as minimal as vincent gets not much more than an enormous creamy kick drum overlaid with a trebly synth texture a moroder arpeggio gutted and left in the dark its all in the details though: the occasional punctuating dead-eyed squirls of noise the exceedingly subtle tension and release dynamics that speak of deft fingers on careworn faders its confrontational minimalism makes it an intensely heady experience but its also pure body music just an all-encompassing kick drum counting down the seconds to dance floor oblivion final surprise comes in the form of a gorgeous chorale-like coda: rich flute-like chords that could be schmaltzy if overused but after all the unremitting darkness make for a moment of spine-tingling release the pleasures dont let up on the b-side is terrifying even by vincents standards an apocalyptic stomp over which bursts of noise spar with gaseous tightly syncopated pads: the sound of a geyser field dancing perhaps finally specks is a nice counterweight to all the gloom and the most overtly new york thing here with its lithe double bass riff and slinky swing although its peppered with vincent trademarks: basic channel-esque dub chords rhythmic snippets of breathing make no mistake though that pitch-black warehouse atmosphere still looms ready to rear up and envelope us in an instant
when first debuted on with soft vision ep project seemed like an agreeable if unremarkable take on 80s baiting chillwave maybe not most distinctive music ever but it worked well with labels recent summery narrative strand fast forward to chris wards debut album and hes turned from bedroom synth enthusiast to one-man-band for better or for worse sounds like work of a real human and wards own androgynous but soothing (and heavily effects-laced) vocals are all over record instead of mangled murmurs that coated previous ep normally at least for me this kind of move into indie rock territory by o rwise electronic artists is troublesome if not just for coat of vanilla it tends to introduce but for all that still feels swampy and of course electronic enough to be on mu all its still hard to sound like a proper band when every instrument leaves behind cloudy vapour trails in thick humidity like its colourful blur of a cover might suggest is visual music to utmost relying on pseudo-synaes tic triggers and reactions to give its traditional songcraft an arty weight and its formless experiments some spontaneity and nuance ward doesnt just rely on elephantine swa s of sound (there might be shoegaze touches but it never smears too much ) the difference from previous material is most pronounced in rhythms often driven by choppy drum kits that wade through heat-induced smog though he accents rhythms with occasional drum fills rudimentary rigour lends it a motorik feel that brings it sometimes uncomfortably close to deerhunter in fact everything right down to wards apa tic vocal cadence is a dead-ringer for atlanta psych rock band an apparent influence that he cant always shake off on get over that comparison (most prevalent in vocal-heavy tracks like ) and nagging feeling that like soft vision before it isnt doing too much of anything different and youve got an album full of pleasantly wistful daydreaming while songs might be grounded by ir determined drums-bass-guitar setup enormous amount of reverb creates hallucinogenic folds and pockets for wards array of synth sounds to lazily drift out of; so when incisive guitar chords on arent grabbing your fancy trickling trail of chimes and flutters probably will in fact thats one of best things about : whe r youve got it on background listening or full-on dissection its fully reversible and has something for every situation you can throw at it while it might not be as fiercely individualistic or visionary as a room(s) or a you stand uncertain debut album stands its ground as a promising start for an artist still figuring out exactly what he wants to say
in the second volume of their remix series juno follows up the success of carl craig s rethink of faze ction s in the trees with a couple of remixes of of by is an exotic sounding venture that was quite the house track back in the day getting spins from mr fingers and tony humphries among others and a listen to the original club mix included here will bring you back to those days when balearic ruled ibeefa it s classic piano led-house in the vein of sueno latino which might not be all the rage these days but hang on scenesters theres some remixes fans of the deep house resurgence will be pleased to see frenchboy julien on the tracklist here his remix is more electronic in feel than his famed swimming places type productions built on an analogue bassline and a toned down rhythm section this is definitely the most energetic and fresh sounding of the remixes on offer managing to marry the keys of the original to a harpsichord for a pulsing eight minutes the pearns and effort isn t much chop it s a grotty guetta-style cut that s basically the egg vs of by the end of this track if youve managed to last that long unfortuntely that egg is stinking to high heaven but if you like aerobics workout music then check out the hotstuff matey 1990 was a long time ago but those idealistic days spawned many a classic juno have chosen well here and the revival of makes this a quality package worth having
t this point might be the most inspired label in ristol over the past few months theyve released two 12-inches that are about as bold and imaginative as dance music gets: pevs ztec chant and lex coultons war games / pointe noire the latter of which came out on dnous ytivil a side-label for artists from outside livitys core trio (peverelist kowton) their hot streak continues with the latest two-tracker from like the best tracks brings out the architectural qualities of rhythm its a sequence of angular percussive loops carefully arranged to form a complex but perfectly balanced whole you get the feeling that if you slipped one out the whole thing would topple in on itself like a jenga tower theres nothing here aside from drums but there doesnt really need to be the stop-and-start rhythm is catchy enough on its own with its standard 4/4 rhythm feels conventional by comparison but its just as elegantly constructed and a bit warmer thanks to some ambient flourishes and a single soothing chord oth feel impossibly tidy and well-honed and reflect a sense for composition thats somewhere near flawless
how might the world end in the four-part the end is ne r series killekills sub-label explores this increasingly pressing question noxious acid techno record from dez williams suggested nuclear apocalypse (or its irradiated aftermath) kamikaze space programmes four-tracker might represent the steely churn of mechanised total war and eeoo s twisted hybrids conjured some kind of biological weaponry the series finale from the german veteran brings to mind something less grisly but no less terrifying its two techno tracks high-intensity tools of the jeff mills school suggest a meltdown of information infrastructure their frantic atonal synth loops mimicking flows of data gone haywire the results arent pretty on a recurring bell-tone sounds panic-stations while staccato synths scrabble desperately to escape the faster is even more deranged its sinewave holding-pattern shrieking along in the low 140 pm range every now and then another synth line swerves across the mix in disregard of the tracks barrelling momentum when things get this bad its every synth for itself
no this isnt kevin saunderson but isnt as far from rust belt electronics as one might presume has been the principal outlet for the belgian musician draak jagers since 2010 jagers sound is variable but generally centers around a simultaneously caustic and soothing type of synthesizer drone recent efforts namely his 7-inch for nna tapes jagers has attempted to merge this sound with a techno sensibility (read: beats) an idea he furthers here albeit a bit more abstractly scene throughout is reminiscent of tarkovskys stalker permeated by a kind of eerie high-contrast industrial calm even the cover essentially a formless gray smudge is suggestive of plumes of factory smoke jagers sets the scene early on with the compressed creak and muffled vocals of while hardly a pop song its one of his most deliberately structured pieces to date track serves as a jump-off point for a series of strangulated ethereal compositions which often resemble a score for an imaginary film offering distended variations on particularly toxic-sounding synthtones even so isnt totally grim and shapeless at begins like an extremely distorted lo-fi take on vangelis-style ambience and ends up swirling around a filtered live-drummer-insinuating pound in its final minute is a brief but surprisingly beautiful sketch as jagers gets a foggy twinkling drone to levitate above and then merge with cavernous bass pulses is a smoldering corrosive behemoth its pervasive rumble lending more than a hint of ominousness to the trembling smudged synths underneath throughout one gets the nagging feeling that these tracks have some kind of backstory jagers may be a lo-fi operator with a proclivity for smothering his sounds but his imagination operates on an epic scale
i really struggle with music and musicians who take themselves too seriously lessio natalizia said last year considering the intimate pop of banjo or freakout and the stately ambient techno of walls his latest project is natalizias clearest stand against po-faced music by filtering his punk noise post-punk and kosmische roots through an arch approach to production natalizia sounds right at home on is the brashest record to date his earlier full-lengths umwelt and redacted merged walls indie leanings with a moody cinematic sound last years nimals as holly dicker noted cast off into unfamiliar and experimental approaches where the undulating synth tones were offset by harsher ingredients using bright synth splashes and pumping rhythms goes even further album could be loosely described as dance music but the tracks dont behave as though they were built for djs sounds like its overheating from the start the snare backfiring against acid arps and sliced vocal loops se elements then settle into a more measured thrust as though the arrangement was built the wrong way round a standout here comes to life with lurid synth shapes squashed vocal samples and brutish unstable drums that could easily derail a dj set albums high energy is balanced by tender synth-led moments ambient feels like a hose-down after the sweat-inducing fun of featuring marie davidson long ll ll is a bright yet melancholic drift nother digression doesnt fare as well s indie dance crossover isnt without merit but the delivery one lyric goes shut your mouth youre some kind of lame / watch yourself you seem kind of fake lacks the punchiness of say but thats a minor complaint and one you might expect of an album that isnt striving for smoothness s upfront sound isnt for everyone but it refuses to be ignored
milo smee doesnt tend to make things easy for himself his band chrome hoof is notorious for its elaborate shows recent production under his inary chaffinch alias heavenz gate was a 20-minute italo disco homage that made lindstrom look minimalist in comparison and that took him two years to make as he recently told juno plus the first record for his label recorded under the new alias seems like it was a lot more effortless ccording to the same interview smee spent three days with a borrowed 303 and an 808 filling up a hard drive in the process however came together it sounds spontaneous with a gnarled acid line in constant mutation over a no-nonsense drum groove the slow tempo contributes to its particularly malevolent feel; so does the distortion which seems less like an effect added on top and more like a substance eating away at the sound from within dvanced dials up the tempo to a quick electro clip tearing into a blippy top line and relishing heart-stopping dropouts and aberrant asides wearing its fondness for drexciya and dopplereffekt on its ragged sleeve its not something you could call groundbreaking but that doesnt make it any less inspired; theres ample infectious pleasure in every bar

sultan follows up the very successful shivers with on featuring zara another amazing vocal talent adding their own sound to this package is nick k and richard earnshaw the original is silky smooth piece full of gorgeous synths sublte basslines and simple beats zaras vocal is floated softly over elements while a nice guitar sample echos after each verse the simple chorded melodies are very pleasing while the vocal never over shadows the production nick k is up next as he hardens the drums and adds a little flare with electro-like effects and gritty synths a grinding bassline drives this track along while the squeeling of sustained synths play perversly with a sample of the vocal the production is seemless with all elements meshing so nicely that you forget that its a remix would love to hear a dub version of this rounding off the remixes is richard earnshaw as he delivers a straight up west coast style mix with piano melodies while tweaking the original guitar adding to it a twang bouncy basslines and happiness all round is the mainstay here while the vocal gets front stage treatment throughout the mix as an extra goodie have provided a track by sultan called whatever here we see strong beats and rasping percussion create a driving feel while heavy guitar samples and riffs play havoc with your ears the guitars are heavily effected and are rarely assisted by other elements as a release the quality and variation will suit many in the house department sultans productions are always of the finest quality while fast rising star nick k delivers what i feel is the standout here
wax:on residents nathan liddle-hulme and timothy clerkin have been turning out consistently excellent eps from similar ingredients chunky vintage synths popping percussion and extra-meaty basslines since 2009 in they have another set of toothsome mid-paced electro/techno cuts destined for the dj sets of ivan smagghe daniel avery and the like is a particularly heady delight with clanking synth stabs brightly illuminating a landscape of creeping bass s central bass riff calls to mind an updated more sedate take on blackstrobes early 00s hits and its insistent maximal percussion and synth textures invite similar comparisons pulp mix of the title track brings an even heavier bass synth down onto sharp percussion and spacey echoing high notes meanwhile is a robotic chugger with cut-up voice samples augmenting another ominous bassline and retro-futuristic percussion flourishes
in a review of freestyle maven bbie b writer frank kogan once copped to mishearing her hit lookout weekend instead of sussing smoke machines and laser rays he instead heard fuck machines and razor blades perhaps he was instead hearing this 80s cut that language has taken to editing on dont the intent on being deviant and lurid its a sluggish synth-heavy track that if its not screwed is at least feeling the effects of some powerful quaaludes its hard to imagine a prime time for this save to say that it might take the right combination of early morning and blood chemical levels to work its effect properly not quite fuck machines and laser rays its at the very least a mashing of smoke machines and razor blades on the flip the heretofore unknown (to me) umps builds up a slow epic disco monster with congas flute and piano s the purred female vocals start echoing across the surface it begins to gather steam with flashes of strings and a cavernous guitar lick y the time it reaches the chorus of feeling red hot for you it gets quite sultry indeed
simple one is the first collection from will saul s label and is a straightforward no frills set of eleven tracks put together by saul and artists he has worked with in the past sideshow precision cuts and walking hintenaus because there are only eleven tracks the mix can unfold at a natural unhurried pace and sideshow s waiting in the darkness paints a cool nocturnal soundscape that slowly grows in substance saul s own fast lane is typical of the sound of the album driven by slow but meaty bass lines and minimal textures not much treble here sometimes the music is in need of a little extra colour and more textural variety but it s a mostly solid affair occasionally saul rubs shoulders with techno with mathew jonson s remix of sideshow s slide a case in point or he merges house and breaks as in the move between precision cuts royal flush and walker hintenaus pinrose which is easily the most exciting moment on the disc as the beats converge and 303s fire around the edges simple one shows plenty of promise and is an atmospheric assured first release if you re into cass and the sabotage sound this is a logical next port of call
after records from sangue de cristo and label founders photonz lisbons imprint turns to another portuguese producer pal + who makes a rather astonishingly assured debut is engrossing from the get-go with a tough syncopated chug that sounds like marcel dettmann gone reggaeton that alone would have made a perfectly serviceable drum tool but pal + doesnt stop there over the top he layers a great shimmering arc of a synthesizer melody with long sustained notes ringing against softly stabbing chords if you listen closely there are even birdcalls deep in the mix adding subliminally to the tracks wide-open sense of space brooding is darker and grittier with cheap-sounding synths staking out a position smack dab between chicago house and london grime again theres a lurching sense of swing to the groove that seems to be a hallmark of portugals bass producers right now remixing erlins snuff suck virtually all of the melody on the track concentrating on a relentless jacking drum-machine jam a rigid staccato rager so airless it feels almost vacuum packed
since peeling back from his lazer sword partnership and transplanting to erlin ntaeus roys heretofore-hidden 4/4 passions have taken centre-stage in his work as debuting proper on hotflush ukg saccharin and vigour were poured into the labels atmospheric mould in further with time out offering a more despondent than danceable pastiche of groove and bass he has taken a particularly imaginative approach on remixes his version of ghostpoets liiines for example is barely recognisable and even though he wanders a well-trodden path his nomadic dance cocktails have been both balanced and moreish renowned for looking forward and back with its equally weighted series of reissues even the new stuff from rush hour has had a retro feel from raille to cosmin trg follows suit in the title track breaks 90s pop-house hit show me love over a syncopated drum pattern and twists it out of euphoria with threatening ardcore synths on the other hand sees him approach uk bass with a lazer sword cap on to produce a glitched-out night slugs instrumental charged with future garage emotion while isnt exactly breaking ground and indeed joins the ever-growing pile of multi-referencing records its familiarity is its charm
i fell in love with techno because it boils down to one beautiful thing: the thrill of the bold new record that shows up in the middle of the night without any explanation electronic music is about the mysterious frequencies issuing from a speaker in a concrete basement and revealing strange new worlds from artists who refuse to give you anything to hang onto nonymous diffuse and cloaked in mythology: this is how records like losing control and phylyps trak ii made the rounds 15 years ago and its heartening to see this approach is still alive in todays age of digital chatter the latest record from the camp is filed under and this applies to the genre too techno lounge dubstep i cant figure it out what i can tell you is that i havent been this excited about a record since jichael macksons reitling orbiter 8 or going further back thomas rinkmanns entry into the 20 to 2000 series does exactly what it advertises buzzing and looping like a busted videogame soundtrack with a few high tones that keep creeping up the scale and twisting the screws the tension is stretched so tight that when a few sharp hi-hats pop up at the last minute the effect is devastating despite its low-slung tempo is a remarkably aggressive track and very well executed nonetheless its destined to live in the shadow of its massive sister t eleven minutes is an unwieldy machine that sounds like an old disco 45 slowed down to 33 revolutions per minute you can hear the plastic cracking and the needle jumping as it spins you into a slow narcotic haze theres a remarkably raw texture here as if the song were built from scotch tape and string little fractured gasps of soulful moaning are carefully hung along the peaks while scraps of melody blanket the floor of the track: a few swelling chords here a flight of lasers there s breaks apart around the seven-minute mark you realize what an improbable structure it is and youre left marveling at the serendipity of finding a record like this
with a mix of bass guitar live-sounding percussion analog keyboards guitar feedback and chiming bells s second single for eskimo -space breaks from the labels recent space-disco fixation towards the rock end of the spectrum (as in their recent daniele aldelli cosmic rock mix) whispered vocals tighten up into a bit about: i cant i cant believe in nothing which then turn into a dramatic near-falsetto and a group chant though fedis pout shades too close to that of s nic fer for comfort myself i cant believe that hot-dog guitar solo that fedi takes on top of the booping keyboard line midway through only to return to more shredding near the end etween the vocal style and soloing it may put more than a few people off out of s remix of the tune centers the thump and surrounds it with slivers of scratched guitar strings and tickled keys they dub out fedis word nothing and speed it up even more leaving behind the rock dynamics for a little less variation epic -side yeah makes clear fedis debt to early lcd soundsystem and their hybrid of rock and dancefloor moves it opens with seething mass of synthesized squalls live bass high-pitched guitar (at least i think its a guitar) calls and clacking percussion that gains velocity and breadth as it unfolds with its barrage of hand drums and noisy shrapnel it definitely mixes into the rock-disco sound of dfa (think j o y sunplus liquid liquids ellhead ) the breakdown emphasizes the plunked bass strings piling on more squelches and decaying synth chords before fedi pitches everything upwards and upwards ascending towards the stratospheric while slightly messy it tops the a-side
given that has spent much of the last two years reissuing his back-catalogue one has to wonder if there isnt an element of catharsis to clearing the monolake vaults as hes gotten older henke has seemed more interested in producing droning more unabashedly serious music than the dubby explorations that dominate his more rhythm-driven work as monolake its just as well because frankly henke sounds way more at home in art galleries and museums these days than he does rubbing shoulders with t++ or the host of other producers who bear the influence of his earlier more club-tilted work the first new album under any name to show up since 2006s layering buddha certainly appears to back that up the music here first began as part of an audio-visual installation with german sound conceptualist christopher bauder who has a history of turning ordinary items into sound-producing sculptures bauders previous works include a toneladder that you play by walking up and down and a midigun which allows you to shoot your way through a live performance with ableton live or other software for atom bauder built one of his most ambitious instruments to date: a large matrix of 64 helium-filled balloons attached to leds which are used to trigger sound and light to create a constantly evolving sound-and-light sculpture produced the sounds for this balloon-machine working within a framework of tight restrictions and over the course of 2007 and 2008 henke got pretty good at finding his way around the conceptual limitations then is simply that: a document of various ways henke learned to play bauders balloons and it offers the most diverse sound palette the veteran producer has ever committed to one album works with the speaker-rattling drones of 2004s signal to noise but by the time we get to and were into a side of henke we havent heard before with the former dub-techno impresario melding loops of tinny percussion and piano to concoct hypnotic cycles that have more in common with steve reich than surgeon by and weve moved further yet into the distorted contact mics more suitable to the raster-noton crew henkes all over the place here for a producer who often sacrifices a range of sounds in order to focus on atmosphere the approach is utterly refreshing may be one of henkes more conceptual outings but its also one of his most successful in recent years in his own way henke sounds like hes having fun again after years of pursuing the same path given that most listeners who come to this record will have a specific notion of what to expect from the sheer range of directions pursued is quite possibly one of the most compelling reasons to listen to this album over and over again
when alexander ridha aka alex decided in 004 to concentrate on his alias and started releasing maximalist bombs on labels such as gigolo and datapunk he was basically at odds with everything that was going on with berlin techno scene at time he immediately got much needed accolades from likes hell black strobe and tiga course but he obviously already had a well defined musical persona and agenda which he quickly imposed on o rs via remixes f bloc party ( scene defining banquet ) m e recently feist (his take on my moon my man is now as permanent part our psyche as is songstresss album version) ts no wonder n that ridha felt need to launch his label as a vehicle f his own take on what gritty electro fueled techno should be like ridhas sonic identity looms over everything that has been released on in past four years and labels first two compilation is a fitting testament f better f w se to this stubb n vision and dedication that is explained in part by fact ridha himself shows up on bnr vol under a variety aliases like puz que ( euph ic bangalter w thy dont ) ( disc ied ) and obviously ei r with iginals such as ever brutal volta 8 and menacing remixes s breaker (probably most viscerally engaging thing on here with a titillating intro lasting m e than two minutes) o rwise its labels various recent recruits that are somewhat struggling to affirm a real sense an iginal voice: s and unf tunately are all as sub bn youll ever get taken individually mind you tracks such as are effective bangers but lost amongst a 30 track 50 minute long compilation y feel slightly redundant thankfully in retrospect compilation is not as predictable as you might think at first glance f instance djedjotronics a collab ation with singer goes booty with lyrics about big butt girls set to a pumping square beat thus proving re is life in miami bass sub genre mostly known f its limited er assets same could be said about s grime y which wouldnt sound out place on a dj funk ghetto house mixtape fers with and reminders that maximalist underground techno doesnt have to be devoid hum (although inclusion ir inessential one minute skit could have been avoided) n ferociously hypnotic brodinski remix d m s (also included in its paler iginal mix) shows its still possible to make effective acid house without being overtly reverent to genres tenets finally in surprisingly humble mode ridha decides to greet us in lieu his maximal by numbers version with pandullo remix remake an talo classic his label snapped from talian label elletrica in 006 sure its probably telling that best track ever released was licensed from ano r label but when musicologists look to write maximalist genres hist y yll have to use bnr vol as one its archeological starting points m e could ridha ask f

its hard to talk about without mentioning aphex twin he makes playful references in titles like polygon pink toast and idm hooks abound on his recent album but for the most part the reference is an allusion with just the occasional exception to the rule ( midi 14-aug t4it 3 ) on however the connection is more palpable start with the digital media language ( 366 6 lhkjdgh aif ) and the misspelled words then theres the music this time sounds avant-garde and mercurial both in the compositions and across the flow of the album it begins in a buoyant playful fashion with all of s signature reference points is quasi-retro: theres a vocal there are breaks theres a moody reprieve and a squiggle of acid afterwards the title track begins like dawn ripping through an inky night it sounds crumpled and rushing with euphoria before a kick resets the mood and metallic sounds build into a noisy riot woozy downtempo follows on which also ends up flipping itself this time into funky braindance with a zing in its step continues to morph like this hitting an acidic peak on and taking a handful of ambient and downtempo dips until the end 01 might be the best of those lulls its vocal cry floats through the atmosphere above another recording that scrabbles in the dirt this too is a voice as is revealed in the closing detuned monologue without s strange additions 01 could have easily come off as a selected ambient works imitation but with them the track is a warped pastiche that sounds both strange and familiar is a maverick producer with a passion for wayward 90s techno and his label boss is a savvy curator may owe a lot aphex twin but beyond that inspiration this musical world belongs to alone
the lead cut from -ans bow takes nine minutes to play out but every time i put it on i feel like im missing something its big sounding it builds like an anthem but it doesnt impact like one whenever i try to bear down on it it fades away not usually a good sign even for records that go for dramatic backdrop more than they do hook power late in the proceedings when nomaly jonez moans smack my face/up against the wall i perk up whats going on here then the track ends until the right dj convinces me otherwise and never say never it feels like an anticlimax structurally seems a lot more aimless than yet it moves with a lot more purpose here jonezs sung refrain ( you take me to a higher place / you can tell when you take me ) is filtered so heavily that figuring out which parts are words and which are overdubbed inhalations is part of the draw not to mention that all of -ans processing makes her sound more male than female ut the track moves more urgently than the thanks to a crisp hi-hat/conga interweave as well as subtly dramatic pads and patient bass and that adds heft to jonezs ghostly presence

what kind of stuff are you gonna be playing tonight a voice asks at the beginning of s new ep a broad range comes the sheepish reply froths output is doggedly eclectic chopping up all manner of styles to create idiosyncratic party-ready new forms if theres one unifying factor its geography: the l -based producer grew up in the vicinity of london and he repeatedly looks to uk styles for cues whether classic hardcore or the hybrids of more recent years makes this tendency particularly explicit sometimes in several ways at once s rollicking broken-beat techno looks to the early 90s but its rhythmic sophistication and slick execution are closer to uk bass circa 2010 swamp81 looms even larger on with its diced vocal sample and crisp snare drums the tracks use of a siren is telling: its clearly there to convey ravey intensity but it feels too prim and perfect to really get the blood pumping froth fares better when he ratchets up the intensity for the rugged choppage of and on a broken-beat number thats swung almost to the point of dislocation nd just in case that range wasnt broad enough he throws in a hip-wiggling conga love-in that could smuggle itself into a deep house set without so much as a raised eyebrow
danny wolfers has been a perfect fit for l i e s ever since he dropped his exquisite sark island acid ep on the label back in 2011 hes since appeared on the american noise compilation and as one half of dream-house duo trackman lafonte onquiqui but this is his first solo release for ron morellis label since his debut the three tracks here are crammed with now familiar ingredients: beautiful acidic melodies springy bass and unmistakable soul it almost seems churlish to pick a standout but a straight-out floor-ready banger is of extremely high quality setting off at a faster pace than the other cuts it flies along on a gently thudding beat racing hats atmospheric arcs of synth and a pontificating vocal sample y the time a lower-pitched acid riff clanks gloriously into view images of frantic scenes in dark basements from den haag to detroit are firmly lodged in mind the squelchy beat of the title track totters along diligently laying a subtle but solid framework for wolfers trademark vintage synth lines to cavort spookily in the foreground meanwhile is a winding nine-minute synth opus thats as chewily textured as it is flavoursome
work-out album year sophomore outing ups ante on last years street horrrsing turning out six noise-techno epics brimming with sweat-soaked struggle an mic grandeur and soaring catharsis with no less than andrew wea rall on decks duo andrew hung and benjamin power get some real muscle behind m this time and beat-heavy results set m apart from fellow electronic-noise groups like black dice and animal collective on minimal throb that underpinned earlier tracks has blossomed into dense layers stampeding kraut drums that yield a frothy unbridled momentum like that a careening rocket or a runaway freight train drums are spurred on by rough bristling syn sizers that for most part spew out broad emotive chord changes recalling both brian eno and m83 see for example particularly gorgeous organ on that intones over shaking bells and driving martial snares combination propulsive percussion and an mic melodies consistently gives a vangelis-sized sense triumph when you hear flag-wavers like blistering opener you can almost imagine m covering chariots fire spraying glistening 80s classic with grit and gasoline title itself implies a kind mystic athleticism like a runners high and drawn-out peaks overdriven fire that occupy big chunks record seem well-suited for drama long distance run if i ever win a marathon on moon i want searing i/iv chords olympian to blare as i cross finish-line and collapse in lunar dust fact that buttons pull f all this fist-pumping pathos on cheapo gear makes m kind like dan deacon on ritalin while both acts are into a noisy low-budget evocation superhero glory deacon sounds like hes having a pillow fight on a sugar high and buttons ra r like y killed a blunt and n went jogging both hung and powers instruments seem to be composed mostly thrift-store synths and components filched from a radio shack dumpster and ir live show consists two piles parts and wires over which duo bob and weave toy mics crammed in ir mouths on stage two emanate slightly devilish glee a crackpot inventor watching his creations sputter to life a tottering adorable robot army encapsulates this tinkerers joy with its abundance gear-tooth clank and slot-machine clatter hung and power can get away such sonic weirdness in part because ir adaptation straight-ahead rhythms in ir recent ra interview hung describes musical freedom that comes from adopting a dance groove it becomes as he says a platform for exploration in this way allows us to look at techno as emblem a populist experimental art one that is open to new ideas but can connect viscerally with its audience at same time
s last two releases toad blinker and rotary signal emitter were notable for their dissociative techno detritus as much as for their visual component the records are zoetropic picture discs designed to be filmed at 25fps with a high shutter speed i e theyre imprinted with animations that change along with the music the duos debut for pattens label also challenges the boundaries of physical release formats though it may be slightly tricky getting a chance to experience it basically dan hayhurst and reuben sutherland jammed out the records contents and then hayhurst made seven unique dubs to c20 which are selling the proposition of such a ridiculously limited release will surely elicit eye rolls but there is something to be said for preserving the work in its original form especially for music thats alive with such a molten intensity and thankfully are offering a full-length edit culled from the seven tapes as a free download in contrast to their older work and maybe because its four long compositions rather than a bunch of short ones feels especially formless like are struggling to keep an infinite array of sounds under control this imprecision is precisely what makes the record so interesting the spontaneous moments of coalescence stand in stark relief to its blistering undercurrent of machine debris found sound and blurred samples the first part builds on an interweaving of arpeggiated blips and a loose tropical rhythm which gradually get broken up by a seething mass of noise mutations this is essentially how the other three movements unfold as well the duos sputtering tumbling rhythms either consume or are consumed by keith fullerton whitman-style synthesizer tumult in the third movement the stuttering pulsing techno that appears three minutes in dissolves into a submerged resigned organ melody before that too is smothered by a gust of blips and the fourth is like a soundclash between spare stunted drums and a carnival-esque rambunctious cacophony with each side trying to outdo the other although pattens own material is a close analogue the lp is a considerably more difficult listen though no less enthralling many recent techno-noise crossovers have threatened to fall apart at the seams but actually does and many times over
announced himself last year with jo johnson a riotous house jam that sounded like a tennis match played with iron bars finds him slide across from hot creations to its sub-label label hot trax but theres not a whole lot of difference in approach this is pumped-up good time techno with so much going on that at times its almost oppressive t its core is a constant pogoing barrage of toms and crushing hi-hats to which patches in an assault of clattering keys express-train horns and masses of delay as if hes going all out to make you submit subtle no but he succeeds in his aim such is the -sides intensity could have been in danger of feeling anti-climactic but keeps his heel pressed to your chest there are frantic cowbells bludgeoning kicks looped ragga snippets and a prolonged breakdown s 21st rave music is rather irresistible here

is the greatest uk garage there ever has been and probably ever will be hardly anyone can make well worn anthems sound exciting the way he does which goes a long way to explain his continuing popularity through the years ukg became unfashionable his mix for fabric cements a blossoming relationship between himself and the london institution a er some hugely successful sets at the club over the past few years has pedigree in mix compilations his pure cds were a big deal in the uk o en reaching the upper echelons of the compilation charts but despite their commercial success there was something missing from pure mixes were good but tapes of playing at raves like nation were always more exciting hankfully his fabriclive mix is full of the inimitable mixing and quick fire blends that make s live sets so jaw dropping a case in point is the way he brings in using the cue button of the c like an mpc he punches in a vocal sample in triplet time before dropping the track in perfectly on cue ts exactly the kind of inventive mixing that made s boiler room session such a joy the kind of mix that provoked bradley zero to interrupt just to say we dont understand what just happened way he introduces the exmen rework of s is also worth noting is a stone cold classic thats been played at almost every garage night since 000 but manages to mix it in a novel way by flicking between the faders he chops up the sound of two records to create an entirely new rhythmic interplay s been doing this choppy style of mixing for well over 15 years but no one can get close to copying it his high standard of mixing continues apace for 3 tracks result is pure peak time party with almost every blend a creative one and every record an impactful tune selections veer between garage staples and newer tracks from and nerds may have wanted to include more obscure tracks or perhaps try and push the envelope a bit more m glad he didnt s never been a purist and has always had an unpretentious love for uk garages past n 1999 that meant playing records from the genres pre history such as logics blues for with upfront step from groove chronicles oday that means taking anthems like s and rubbing them up against music from the many post uk garage spin offs ts to s credit that when the tunes become a little too corny as they do with s (which riffs on seals killer ) theres always a great mix and a huge record just around the corner s rep has long been a thing of legend within his own genre with any luck this hook up with fabric will win him the respect he deserves across the board
the unearthing of s lost and found: 1998-2000 was one of last year s most surprising discoveries a project of tom thiel (lately of scape duo bus) and max lodenbauer (of nsi) their frequently captivating blend of aqueous drift and intelligent idm beats practically begged for a remix these two minimal updates of jazzy cut therefore come as little surprise and neither do the successful albeit widely disparate results reigning man-of-the-moment ricardo turns in a typically restless thirteen-minute percussive squirm spraying the original like a fire hose over a steady 4/4 thud while hats skip across the surface swathes of pads muffled and ghostly waft by a slight dub tremor surfaces and later an oboe solo introduces melody before skidding to a close in a cloud of glitch and static this blend of seemingly disordered scatter and regimented rhythm is unmistakeably and one of his most joyously functional recent productions the b-side takes a more faithful route with aquatic dubster thomas fehlmann working with tiel s bus partner and shikatapult boss daniel meteo to transform into a swampy blend of rhythmic sludge the 4/4 resurfaces slower and caked in organ-toned mud like many a track from fehlmann s honigpumpe while thiel s role is more difficult to determine it s a great exercise in thick dubby techno but the activity in the gets the nod here
steven warwick knows his cheese on last years d viation ep he mixed casio jams with a serge gainsbourgh-like sense of wink-and-nod humour the french connection became explicit on cetait un ndez-vous in which a car chase through paris is narrated in spoken-word while a blearing saxophone slurs itself over a slow lo-fi groove that the narration managed italian job -style thrills while name-dropping 19th century parisian city-planner georges haussmann is just one example of warwick going beyond simplified ideas of high and low art on -engineering he reuses some of the same tricks but this time the tone is different and more varied there are some proper beats though warwick never lets them get too obvious take the opening few bars of with its big room kick drum quickly overtaken by a jaunty bassline and eventually an 80s synth-pop-style lead melody lyrics describe a clubbing experience with crowd crystals and 5am portal reflection while each element of the music draws on a different style of what we call club music the pounding drums house chords jazzy sax and a sleazy italo synth its hard to imagine anyone else pulling off such a blend thankfully the sense of humour hasnt disappeared behind the higher production values is a short field recording of someone playing a woeful version of wonderwall on berlins u-bahn has cheesy spanish guitar and guest vocalist hanne lippard saying things like welcome to l o l balancing this kind of stuff with more serious material is a genuinely rare skill when was the last time an electronic producer tried to make you laugh channel sits at the heart of the record and is probably its most straight-forward track six minutes of woozy synth bubbling bass and echoing drums combine for a slice of colourful if not outright psychedelic house music its a kind of anchor at the centre of the album a reminder that even when things head towards satire or sound-collage there is a keen musical mind at work underpinning everything with a loose but infectious sense of groove and timing anyone who has heard play live will attest to that -engineering is very much an album designed to be played as a seamless whole its warm fun curious and deeply entertaining its also proof that a little bit of mischief can go a long way
uke kimik the finnish duo conveniently known as u k first came to prominence with their remix of sasha s wavy gravy although that release demonstrated their ability to make solid music this should firmly establish their talents as they produce 4 original works here displaying a great diversity in the process firstly on the a-side is the title track ignite a club friendly production the track begins with some firm drums and in no time at all introduces a very funky baseline designed solely for the dance floor the track progresses with some subtle melodies ringing building towards a delightful breakdown that sees a delicate piano line ride a wave of break beats and base ridden low end sounds the track then takes a melodic turn towards its finale for good measure a good way to kick off proceedings following is the very interesting neurope at first this may scare some off but after numerous listening this really is a great production the slow retro synths ride a wave of slow stuttering beats riddled with some european influenced vocals some stunning strings subtly enter the latter parts of the track really giving it an extra edge quality and unique work from the duo on the b-side is firstly pixie pants this is probably the darkest production in the lot and one must feel it is meant for a big sound system the kick is full of power and after the short vocal interlude at the beginning the baseline drones its way throughout the drums take a tribal formation for the duration as the production remains pretty stagnant gritty house with balls following this is the very quirky fussball the 2nd of the down tempo tracks after neurope this production has a big focus on the quirky pattern of the drums and the smooth rolling baseline which changes in intensity throughout the production the production takes a very acidic shape as it progresses and remains very interesting throughout very impressive ep from the highly talented finnish duo the definitely showcases the potential of these two which the wavy gravy remix for me didn t quite do variety in all 4 tracks and moments to behold more importantly cuba hit the spot; 2 out of 2 for them
fter two initial records on local imprint 200 a cologne-based duo here step up for a third this time on another of the citys stables treibstoff sequenced with sharply-defined hi-hats and sleek synth work the eponymous cut is a decent example of the european interpretation of detroit techno sidestepping the motor citys sometime penchant for intense melodic rhythms it swims with spacey pads managing to sound benign and distant t pfe takes a more drum-heavy tack introducing slappy bongos and a jostling cadence though bumping sharply along its snarling but anemic chords seem to fade forlornly rather than really pop almost sounds like a tribute to booka shade set around cute plucked bass and not much else its woozy swagger and tinny tech house percs mark it a likely candidate for lazy after-hours dance floors

you could probably count the number of individual elements in s four tracks on both hands zak khutoretsky has never been one for excess but his outings on are sahara-desert-sparse take the appropriately titled which is little more than a synth blip lightly swung hi-hats and a snare crack he weaves spartan ingredients into something tense enough to make your shoulders tighten for seven minutes khutoretskys success is in avoiding minimals machine-music precision as with robert hood you can hear his hand at the controls its the slightly off-kilter play between snare and synth squeak in which fall out of time with each other or the choked riffs of that he seemingly struggles to rein in it all peaks on where the bassline feels like it ends a note early the gap drawing you into the next roll of the loop its music made with the precision of a swiss watch
dub techno is whipping boy genre of electronic music critics its not hard hear why: so many of genres practitioners cant seem get past ir love affair with delay and reverb privileging process over result not so who has made his name on taking elements of dub techno and rehanging m in more compelling frames debut album light in dark showcased a mastery of form and his latest is a fur r honing of his style isnt flashy in fact its downright unassuming youve likely heard what - reflections has offer before its heavy bot m-end plugs along similar smooth linear bump of a conforce or fred p track its simply extremely well-executed stuff right when youre ready for a ticking snare it appears the tidy breakdown that doesnt let foot off pedal o much yes of course and second melody that interlocks gracefully with percolating synth do you even need ask arrangements on are secret its success as thom yorke might say everything is in its right place what sets apart from its peers is its driving sense of momentum rarely lets a track go without plugging stuttering hi-hats or snares in between kick drum its a simple trick but results are hugely effective even when nothing is happening things seem be moving along you can hear this deployed in both and the former a contender for moodiest dub techno record of year would be weighed down without constant chittering meanwhile gets elevated from nice-enough tech-house-with-a-dollop-of-dub-on- p straight-up-banger as a result also of note is whose frenetic acid line recalls same sort of magic conjured up delta funktionen earlier this year on oddly enough also titles a track here but its instead a stately patient number that never bubbles completely over itd be a perfect final comedown if it werent for closing things out but track while a curious album closer actually goes some way wards reaffirming what rest of is about: expertly arranged techno with dub uches that complement and dont over-egg pudding keeps it simple on and it has resulted in one of most enjoyable full-lengths of year
we havent heard from christine clements since the heyday of autonomic the tight-knit scene she was a crucial yet overlooked part of after she went quiet in 2010 it seemed unlikely that we would ever hear music from again is a pleasant surprise then although its not quite a comeback clements has chosen tracks from her archives making notable only not just for its out-of-nowhere release but also because except for it sits at 140 bpm rather than 170 the usual drum bass tempo whats even more remarkable about it though is how fresh and cutting-edge these tracks sound the title track is up there with clements best work its a playground of hi-tech sounds and everything whirs and hums in the peripheries like some vast intricate machine whose inner workings are on display built on odd percussive sounds that range from blown-out handclaps to giant pillars of static its warm and frigid all at once the reprise replaces the stiff march with a rubbery garage-indebted rhythm while the wobbling is like cold hard marble on a heavily-manipulated vocal winds and darts around the drum track it outlines the style in one sleek package: alluring precise and like nothing else out there

shortly after releasing the aerial album dave huismans told ra he was glad for a break from a cohesive unified sound now i can lose that focus again and just wander around regardless of genre or tempo or sound 2562 the name assumed for huismans techno-leaning dubstep work has certainly evolved sonically but the major outlet for this wandering tendency seems to be the material he releases as ostensibly a techno venture the records have ranged from sputtering technoid steppers ( density ) to bedroom experiments ( shortcuts ) to massaged-keyboard house ( sunday ) its as though this project is made-up anew with each record which makes its regular successes all the more satisfying clone describes as four raw house tracks from the vaults presumably this means theyve been cellared in huismans hard drive for a while but feel free to imagine them unearthed from a misremembered chicago of yore brisk opener skipping melodies are transmitted as choppy acid pulses and hand claps are the preferred form of punctuation its weaned on the likes of dj pierre or nitro deluxe sure but has synthesized too many off-genre impurities for any generic mold to take deviates further fashioning a jacking beat from a rattling assembly-line din and peppering it with gaping yawns of sub-bass la peter van hoesen occasional swells of strings bathe in luxurious pastels but the palette remains quite stark for the bulk of the track creepy prowling house its the highlight of the set features chains of hi-hat huge echoing hand claps and mechanical clamor its the drum-line snare rolls that really stand out though drum programming being the main attraction here the day-glo synths sighing chords and intermittent keyboard blurps play a supportive role and reverently augment the busy rhythms with a hushed eeriness melody as such is bowled over completely in the twittering chirps sleepy keyboards and acid bass all locked into identical percussive stutters accumulated atop what would otherwise be a pretty straightforward beat they turn the rhythm into a dizzying droning twitter its weirdo house for sure but somehow maintains an accessible clap your hands to the beat shuffle if there was any concern that would be a clearing house for some neoclassical agenda these tracks should come as some relief s roots run deep but this a singular record thats not easily categorized not even as the new made up sound
this is the second ep thats conceptually rooted in the five stages of grief: denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance it may seem like a high conceit but it works and beautifully sharply honed dance music motifs that swim in the vast space seem untethered from any club context instead pointing in on themselves clocking in at less than three minutes each many of the tracks have a discomfiting way of ending just as you expect them to peak take a near-beatless track where a funky bassline and a crystalline vocal loop tread circles around one another without reaching any resolution or whose sinuous synth lines and pitchbent vocal snippets stack up over a sparse kick pattern before dissipating as on the first volume of im fine uses vocal samples liberally re are clear precedents to the pitchbent r b lines but s aggressive minimalism makes them more in line with oneohtrix point nevers recent work than burial next to and which have as much in common with ambient as with grime and are more rhythmic and propulsive latters dense thicket of percussion in particular offers welcome relief from the eerie beatlessness but its to s credit that the melancholic cloud never lifts
eamon harkin will be a name familiar regulars of new yorks sunday best and mister saturday night parties but steve raney will probably be less so despite a smooth disco cut last year on buzzard gulch that sound warm velvet 80s disco house is continued on ir debut solo release for vintage roland hi-hats and handclaps alongside a resonant bass motif plod smoothly through title track as various lush chord patterns come in and out at a whim the structure is an interesting one amplifying dizzy circular nature of riffs mselves with combined centripetal force pulling helpless dancer in a lush confused world of disco balls and quaaludes fans of chunky analogue sounds will love populettes remix; its so full of m res little room for anything else the round filtered bassline riff arpeggios rising throughout track even unsettling pad that shivers just on edge of immediate recognition sounds thick its hard say which is more serious remix or original and y both feel like same deep time of morning but yre distinct moods perhaps occupying same place and time but in parallel universes chantals the realm is yet again dealt with in for me this vocal and its legion of similarly spaceheaded offshoots are far o ubiqui us although its got something of a relevant place in an early release from se ny club heads the underneath is tasteful: more swirling syncopated funky bassline disco programmed in a way that approaches metro areas grasp of simultaneous classicness and cutting-edge great weekends master goes fantastically (and thats not say that precursors arent good) in a completely different direction with his remix its like luke viberts most experimental material but with even more random scattiness its in 6/8 time but flirts with straight 4/4 with a hobbling bassline and squelches and moronically insistent dischords visiting like an uninvited guest popping ir head round door and freaking out everyone in room
somethings up at hq labels owner hke recently announced he would turn it over while he dealt with mental health issues label promised to reissue some records and put out new releases that were already planned come 2018 would then enter the chaos era whatever that was supposed to mean s it turns out that was a four-compilation series called chaos we know that though because it came out last month n by someone called popped up on the labels bandcamp its not strictly new it first appeared last year on a label called vault xyo which only put out three releases before closing is likely the work of hke who has a long list of aliases its a curious but welcome reissue that presents some of his strangest work first track comes to sudden stops with manipulated vocals so low and queasy they sound demonic ep has the same yawning melodies of hkes dragon soul along with songs that feature his trademark murky rhythms ( ) but the vocals are choked the drums are off-piste and the tones are unusually dissonant best track has an old orchestral recording chopped into jerky phrases its crumbling facade adds to the feeling that this ep is an oddity from the depths and though its not hkes most approachable release its among his most original whatevers in store for this reissue suggests it remains as unpredictable as ever
during last years dekmantel festival i received multiple videos from friends recorded during ricardo villaloboss main stage set funnily enough they were all of the same track which obviously seems to have made a good impression ricardo rides the fader cutting up long looping circles of rising pitches before a fill precedes a deliciously swinging house beat madness ensues its called which is also the name of this three-tracker from mexican producer it also marks raum musiks 100th release the track is dead simple as if its aware of its own strength shuffling along on a no-frills but highly effective bedrock of ducking sub and skipping garage rhythms the ever-rising synth screams wheres the drop without feeling manipulative or corny allowing the drums and bass to come in and out with tireless efficacy its a bona fide destroyer that should find traction in big rooms and small basements alike plays a similar trick the drums are textbook house classicism presented with a supercharged modern edge while a queasily descending pad droops down as the bassline climbs ever upward the simple contrast of rising and falling pitches in combination with the dependable groove makes it another resolutely driving slab of house lifes o is a hair straighter and brighter with a swelling string sample gliding atop yet another cannot-fail drum and bass combo these two productions arent in the eternal smasher category of the title track nor are they exactly remarkable but theyre hardly filler they could create their own moments in the dance and round out an ep thats worth the cost of entry for the alone
for many trance was the beginning of a whole new and different world of music it was the beginning of new experiences and discovering new sounds an underground sound that many did not understand in many ways the enjoyment of trance was like being a part of a truly secret society which wasn t that entirely secret if you knew what you were looking for quite a few years have passed since i became enthralled with the genre and while i may have moved on to other things i still try to keep in touch with this aspect of dance music that kept me happy for many weeks months and ultimately years one dj whose career i have continued to follow is holland s armin van buuren over the years his various compilations have been a staple in my cd collection and played many times over on varying occasions i still regard his boundaries of imagination a personal classic and play it whenever possible with the volume of my stereo turned up to a ridiculous level as i dance around my apartment pretending i m once again a fearless twenty something year old in 2003 armin released the first in a new series entitled universal religion to say that i was disappointed with that release is an understatement if diplomacy must rule i found it somewhat dull earlier this year his a state of was released with much acclaim and fanfare but for me it was another disappointment so when live from armada at ibiza reached my desk i honestly wasn t expecting anything that i would like i was wrong opens with the enticing beats of synergy s hello strings the melody of this track establishes the overall feel of this compilation which is ultimately a trance aspect but with lush progressive overtones this feel is beautifully followed up with one of my favourite tracks from this year when the opening chords of tilt s the world doesn t know comes into the mix it s all about that chugging bass and the overlying melodic chords definitely one of the best crossover tracks that works extremely well in either a progressive or trance mix a somewhat progressive tone is continued with lolo s why which i swear pays homage to sasha s xpander in the best possible way andy moor s presence has already been felt with the inclusion of tilt s wonderful tune but ridgewalkers find smacks of his remixing talents which is up next once again it s that signature galloping bass that grabs your attention the breezy vocals only add to the intoxicating sound of this tune with audioholics external key the mix starts to take on a more uplifting trance feel with its infectious hands in the air beat and then moves onto the guitar inspired riffs of perry o neil s waveforce i ve heard many great things about this talented dutch dj and producer but nothing that prepared me for what i was about to hear this particular tune begins on a darker tip but completely changes once those guitar riffs take hold this track encompasses the majestic qualities of trance that i always love so much i adore this tune and it s without question my favourite on this compilation a much loved label of mine is deep dish s well respected yoshitoshi and up next is one of my favourite tracks this year is their release of deepsky s talk like a stranger i ve only ever heard this in its original form but markus schulz has remixed it into brooding scorcher with its hypnotic padded bass the next track that comes into the mix is probspot s foreplay this is almost like a sneak attack of beats because the melody hits you at a time when you think deepsky s track has exploded onto a different level it hadn t in reality armin s introduced foreplay perfectly into the mix and what a track it s the driving feel of the melody that grabs you and doesn t let go you could have kicked me senseless but i d still have a smile on my face whenever i hear this track simply awesome just over the halfway point of the compilation we re now moving into proper trance territory with tranquility base s surrender for me this is respect to the old skool style of trance and perfectly encompasses what i always regarded as the balearic influences of the genre the bass is energetic but without being ridiculous up next is the super 8 remix of mirco de govia s voller sterne which is a tune that continues with that balearic feel as always it s all about the breakdown the uplifting melody and hands in the air action a slight key change can be heard when the opening strains of enmass s cq (seek you) are introduced but that euphoric feel is once again continued even though the tone is now beginning to wind down as we near the end of armin s mix the down play continues with active sight s out of our lives which has a deeper more languid feel within its beat the rising melody and breakdown is only a teaser but still effective you can t help but smile with signum s the timelord it s now obvious that the mix is coming to a close the atmospheric tones have now taken on a much darker and final feel if we were in a club this would be the hope before the final storm because harmonious structure only manages to tease you into staying even though you sense the end is near and with that the murky beats of armin vs m i k e s intruder ends this is almost an evil way to end a mix dark but inviting urgent yet calming at the same time the high-toned acidic synths solicit screams for more but its probably the best way to end a night i really was quite skeptical when i received this cd but after having heard it not once but a number of times over i honestly think this is one of the best trance compilations i ve heard this year for me it has all the qualities that i look for in a trance compilation because regardless of people s cynicism i know when the genre of trance is mixed properly it too has the capability of presenting a musical journey it began on calmly melodic yet progressive tip with synergy s hello strings and then moved onto a more euphoric trance sound with perry o neil s waveform from tranquility base s surrendered the mix captured a driving almost pulsating momentum and then took on a darker deeper quality from active sight s out of our lives until the mix drew to a close so was i surprised was i impressed was i pleased with what i heard a resounding yes to all counts my belief in armin van buuren s talents as trance dj have never wavered and this release is the reason why my tastes have veered away from the general sound of trance over the last few years and as a result i ve become a quiet pessimist while i will never bitch and moan about the obvious letdowns of the genre these days what i will do is holler loud and clear when something truly impresses me and this mix did is programmed beautifully all the tracks on this are superb armin s mixing is spot on as i would have expected it s that simple will this compilation sound dated in a few months time well all things eventually sound dated however i m only concerned with the here and now and this has captured the current state of trance quite effectively the usual suspects will scoff at my enthusiasm but i don t care i have no shame in saying that as a reviewer that primarily listens to progressive i adore this compilation and am a huge armin fan listening to this mix reminded me of my trance roots and how much fun i had back then it was all so easy it was all about the music armin van buuren s latest compilation may very well capture the sound of ibiza but i m moving to holland much respect tracklisting: 1 synergy hello strings 2 tilt the world doesn t know 3 lolo why 4 ridgewalkers find (andy moor mix) 5 audioholics

both members of instra:mental have been prolific since the celebrated d b duo disbanded last year alex green has explored tough analogue territory as boddika while damon kirkham has been carving out a slowed-down techno/electro niche as this is the second release since the sci-fi-tinged electro of last years idoru and it largely picks up where that album left off is a pleasingly streamlined electro groover with eerie disembodied vocal samples bouncing off a core of thwacking kicks and hats upping the ante further is a pounding slab of dread-techno anchored by taut yet elastic drums loose hats and great arcs of bass remixes of come courtesy of dbridge and newcomer ore at four minutes the formers rework is relatively succinct and dials the originals speed and aggression down settling on a contemplative bass drum-driven chug ores remix by contrast starts out as an echoing atmospheric work-out morphs into a warehouse-ready banger and then comes full circle fading into a fuzz of distant industrial clangs

next up on the flashy titled records is a sold house number from the the track is and it comes with mixes from go dimaggio as well as a mix from daniel poll and the original on the a-side is firstly the go dimaggio buddafish dub now this track is simply all about the baseline and its grooves very chunky 4/4 beats begin proceedings combined with a very subtle but delightfully produced set of high toned effects as soon as the smooth warm pads come into the track as well as the deep baseline the production hits another notch and a good one at that combining to make a smooth solid tech house cut the daniel pole mix on the flip is quite a quirky remix that relies on a deep and quite subtle baseline while the vocal gets effected and is left to combine with smooth moody atmospheric sounds the original mix has the funkiest feel of the lot with bouncy vibes as well as a chunky beat and pretty solid baseline to boot the track maintains a pretty standard flow with no real dips or rises in action but nevertheless it s a smooth techy but with a good funk a nice solid release by that is sure to please the a-side is where to look for me though as go dimaggio work some nice grooves in his reworking

manchesters has been around for some time yet his dense and aggressive outing on rush hour last year was the one that seemed to finally turn heads this debut on leeds 2020vision mines a similar vein: anthemic overpowering intense and relentless made from a rusted splintered palette of sound it meshes brash percussion with snappy drums and pinging cowbells while interlacing the foreboding echo of a male voice that seems to beam down from stormy clouds above final third eases up slightly with an icy melodic hook piercing through as radiant pads levitate the whole thing to a slightly higher plane if you need to re-arrest your drifting crowd this is the one replacing the pointy edges and scatty lines of the original freerange boss jimpster favours much smoother contours for his two remixes unrelated dub one comes first and is as youd expect liquid and lateral with soft shakers and softer synths bleeding out to an imagined horizon second remix is that bit more urgent with distant acid imperfections a jacked up but still dubbed out beat and sinewy synth sounds forming a seductive solvent into which the soulfully re-worked vocal delightfully melts

for those that havent followed closely the 2008 transformation of the british duo from sultry purveyors of silky electro-pop to folksy troubadours with a sudden knack for psychedelic pastoralism might have been a surprising one the one constant of the group however has been a sense of adventure: the move was fueled by allison goldrapps alleged boredom with the characters she had created on black cherry and supernature thats why its so puzzling to see them come back to the sound that most thought they had abandoned for good on their fifth album when youre as proficient as at producing little synth-pop pearls you should never shy away from it s only flaw on is that they havent self-indulged enough the albums lead single joyfully telescoped kim carnes and van halen while simultaneously displaying a distanced irony and wholehearted merrymaking ts duplicated on obvious future single the elegant and the shameless each surpass s own penultimate number 1 single in terms of gracious electrofied songwriting and however predictably ventures into the kind of cabaret-like boogie they once displayed on satin chic while and the title track have the glacial overtones of their early songs which makes you wonder why they didnt explore the brash synthetic vibe further the only moment they deviate from this self-imposed format is on album closer a surprisingly avant-garde instrumental piece that uses allisons varied cooing to create the kind of adventurous electronic music explored by laurie erson in the 80s n a recent piece for the guardian simon reynolds noticed (lamented ) how the previous decade seemed like a long 80s-like revival that started with discovery and emerge and ended with bulletproof and delphic on the basis of it seems its far from over and it might just never be nonetheless this album sounds a bit like the revival needs a new idea or two bar that bright pink one-suit jumper those thunderous poses and the occasional encapsulation of pops own genetic map is the sound of a restrained other contemporary revivalists are rarely accused of the same guess this is what they call maturity

label owners dee kline and ollywood take to the decks alongside the ragga twins mcs for a 4-man 4-deck mash up 4 all da breakbeat heads in the place (4x4x4 ) featuring the anthems that have made the breaks scene what it is today and new tunes from the likes of aquasky vs masterblaster rennie pilgrem zinc hype stanton warriors all the way to local aussie breakbeaters nubreed ransom and phil k upon first inspection of the tracklisting the cd seemed unextraordinary as there were plenty of tunes which appeared on other cds however deek-line and ollywood breathe life back into the tunes cutting and scratching on top of them with ample skill while the ragga twins fire off their vocal artillery with precision accuracy aquasky vs masterblaster make quite an appearance and rightfully so - they are one of the leaders in the scene at this point in time take it to the floor starts off the mix as do collabos with the ragga twins their newie coffee and the massive all in check - you think the twins would keep quiet since theyre were already on the record - hah they ripped into both routines not missing one single word yet still being able to improvise pilgrems remix of emit/collect by zer0 is still one hell of a powerful breaks tune thanks to that synth melody and overall aggressive feel rippin up wax is the latest tune done by deek-line and pilgrem and theres definitely influences heard from both producers - the garagey basslines of deekline and the crisp drum breaks of pilgrem on an anthems tip tunes like 138 trek by dj zinc gets a subtle reworking with mc skibadee doing his man-a-man routine on top of that bassline whilst shut up dances nova and the stanton warriors bootie of cosmos break me with you can hold their own as being the most party-oriented tunes in the list gotta love that stanton style breaks/house crossover business - you gotta do what you gotta do to get the masses into the breaks sound of course its pointless to release a mixed cd without adding in new tunes and showcasing the underground breakbeat talent whod buy it not really newcomers to the scene but lesser known producers such as ed 209 djs mutiny and quest get a chance to shine with their tunes be-bop scratch ting and storm respectively all tunes on a wicked garage tip featuring filthy basslines - check out the rising basslines on be-bop for example these breakbeat kids - the future generation of beatmakers local heroes nubreed phil k and ransom alongside deek-line offer up the bushpig this time it features new vocals by vocalist yolanda - for about 1 verse its a dope tune no matter how you look at it - hip hop vocal samples cut up on top of one big bassline and chunky breaks the recipe for rocking a dancefloor to end it all off - reclaim the streets by dj hype vs shut up dance a swingstepper with a discernable punk/ska feel to it - if the beats are hard to dance to mosh whats really impressive about this mix is the really live feel about it - the lack of editing tools used to create the mix as evidenced by a slight loss of sound quality towards the end the beat matching is tight so what you get here is one slick mix without it feeling too programmed - its a collection of the phattest tunes that have made a definite impact on the breaks scene in the past 3 years and then some check out the website for more breaks related info

italian producer has constantly reconfigured tech house over the last year or so be it the choppy stuff of his breakthrough single on c cille the booty-charged wmc anthem he released on saved or the ghetto-fried bass of his ep for monique musique the italian producer seems never short on inspiration maybe its for that reason that steve lawler has snapped him up for a debut album with the first insight as to what to expect the original is another party-starting turbo-charged and full fat bouncer basically but still manages to entice owing to keen production and a tasteful sense of fun never staying in one place for too long theres resonance in the downbeat and reflective synths movement in the ever-shimmying snares and hooks aplenty in the form of an indecipherable vocal snippet: together it all adds up to something lovably carefree franco on remix duty squares off the bass yet further with the raw resultant kicks laced with bluesy horns and wonky chords
philip sherburnes 2010 interview with barcelonas helped shine a light on a singular talent this dainty little release from a label based in the catalan capital is a seven inch that further confirms as remixer and original artist with a rare grasp of nuance when it comes to electronic music because its on short play format both tracks are correspondingly brief affairs s edit of t m b is a reworking of a remix of an obscure marvin gaye track ( m making sense oh good) working with one of the great voices of all time is a daunting prospect but s shows a sympathetic lightness of touch a smattering of harps a simple delayed rimshot the merest hint of bass notes perhaps reserved the bass for his own a balearic fantasia of sombre church organ swells booming sad bass quasi baroque pads and ir style vocodered vox brief they may be but this is fragile slow moving emotive uncompromising music making

long limber lines that float into forever tripping techno tunes that transcend time smooth supple synths holding you in their hypnotic spell its head-fuck techno and its what has been offering up over the course of quickly establishing itself as one of the go-to labels for the sound label head tom bonaty has a serious jones for the stuff picking up where a number of imprints have left off namely elettronica romana which was among the first labels to release records from the likes of and donato dozzy giglis second ep for is even better than his excellent debut with coming in above the others here by virtue of its 12-minute length the light trancey techno that gigli and others has been putting out shines when given time to stretch out properly call me crazy but when i listen to my mental image is of a rug being unrolled into eternity its as though it and and are unspooling their sound into the stereo and you simply have to follow along if that isnt the greatest description of what it sounds like thats kind of the point giglis music is all about the feel like techno skipping across the top of a lake (the watery sounds on may have something to do with that ) observation document 1 is an environment and its worth getting lost in it for a long while

from the opening notes of the decidedly eastern-tinged with its chimes sprinkled over what sounds like some cracked japanese stringed instrument its clear that is no longer trading in the candle-lit deep house of his excellent first album glass eights theres a good reason for this alongside his dial-mate paul kominek (pawel) roberts edits a magazine called travel almanac and hes said in recent interviews that his new album bears the marks of his journeys around the world not least in the form of field recordings collected on his travels fans of roberts past productions shouldnt be put off by this slight musical turn is still a very dial affair when stripped to its essentials consider the buoyant synth melody that anchors or the glowing interstellar churn of but with less of a steady house beat here roberts flushes out his sonic palette with a variety of percussive switch-ups and novel instrumental flourishes like detuned pianos cellos violins and odd-sounding guitars all of which lend the album a decidedly far eastern tone one of the first elements to stand out with is its unconventional rhythmic backbone for example rides a very acoustic-sounding clatter into a swirl of twitchy synths on a stumbling drum pattern undercuts a moaning almost pleading intro to create something murky and vaguely menacing begins with a brief gong stroke before segueing into a gorgeous piece of japanese folk music that resets the albums pace briefly only to resume with the throbbing jazz drums and stirring tones of the title track is a change in the weather steelier and more withdrawn its an interesting contrast to the placid experimental touches roberts has layered into his increasingly nuanced take on deep house one that often resembles the work of the ambient artist susumu yokota and ultimately thats what you have to appreciate about his development here is very much the sound of but a whos fascinated by the sonic revelations of travel one of the sounds roberts collected abroad was a cedar soaking tub overflowing in kyoto i cant think of a better image for the exotic warmth of

dave clark aka luma truffle club and several other aliases is as is often said a glasgow legend artefacts such as the two tracks on both are previously unreleased straight-to-tape cuts from 1994 are reminders that along with his innate skill clark has put in many years of work to reach this position clarks alias is best known for the breezy late-90s electro track portland as well as the ricardo villalobos and tuff city kids remixes that eventually followed the chords on give it some of portland s grainy charm but where that one lurched giddily forward has a sinister tint thanks to glimmering keys and pads that recall warps mid-90s output is more densely percussive techno its assortment of drums pops and clanks rising to an almost ritualistic crescendo as keys sigh periodically in the background both cuts emanate clarks usual confidence and both sit comfortably in his varied and impressive canon
the first 12 inch release on is a milestone the first single of its diameter (both of its predecessors have been 10 inches) it also harbours the first material not produced by infra boss spatial to be released on the label bringing back the concept of a split single spatials enlisted two of future garages brightest hopes in and for the honour chicago raised shares more than a passing aural resemblence to the previous output on the label with airy pads delayed for eons supported by a rough and punchy 2 step beat and super high pitched vocal snippets that scream at the perfect moment pips the post of s work on here with its constant detroit pulses and clean sine wave bass clawing for a little more attention than the rough thunder of his drum work on londons own who came to light after a sterling effort on the highpoint lowlife label is a bass producer with a subtle difference his passion for rave music is undeniable with waify intro melodies skipping through primitive percussion and on into the leading piano workout on but he doesnt sound as excessively throwback as say zomby or shitmat the melding of rough bass the simplicity of his skipping drum samples and the general tinny cleanliness of his piano samples on proves this and offer a glimpse of a wholly original producer fighting to break through the hordes of producers painting dubstep not dubstep by numbers
babylon records have been a favourite label of mine for a while now the last couple of releases have been great and can costa dizzy synths has been a staple in my sets for sometime for their latest release they bring us park street and have asked damien heck to provide the remix joels original is a nice uplifting breaks cut but unfortunately i have heard this style a million times before it brings nothing new to the genre and leaves me cold its damien heck to the rescue though as damien turns the track into a hard hitting house cut with an electronic edge damien adds a deep sub bassline and some heavy guitars to the mix giving the track a much tougher and more current feel add that to joels uplifting synths and you have a definite winner damien heck has saved this track from being just another progressive breaks cut and for that he should be commended i predict big things for both babylon records and damien heck in

theres a reliability to david moufangs work that ensures every release is worth investigating might not break into new territories its a warm and springy deep house track that pretty much finds moufang on autopilot but its a supple and lovely enough thing regardless its fat breezy organ chords and pinpricks of piano feel early afternoon languid while a stammering bass motif burbles upward as if to give certain bars extra emphasis is a slightly moodier prospect its an entirely spacier beast spending its first few minutes swimming lazily in a choppy sea of low-end drone like the -side it could quite happily work in a sun-soaked daytime set the tracks middle section is almost cartoonishly mellow but theres a terser edge to its percussion that hints towards twilight t the same time it never quite rouses itself to action preferring to drift along in comfortable spaced-out reverie s with its blissed-out elegance sounds like the most effortless and natural thing in the world
s citifunk ep for deep explorer ranged from gentle gyration to quirky funk its opening track no 1 was a veritable massage of a track and its jazzy samples laid-back grooves and neo-detroit keyboards left me particularly keen to hear what the tokyo-based dj producer and graphic designer would do for the textile mavens at s the -side winds cooly an uppity spoken reprimand accuses the listener of misunderstanding house music misappropriating it and diluting the scene if the intent is to be off-putting then i guess the exclusionary harangue is successful running for the better part of the track its as distracting as it is truculent and rather at odds with the stylish cocktail-hour sway that backs it which is otherwise quite inviting those who arent shooed away a brief informational lecture follows in the form of an extended eddie rmador citation not everyone understands house music its a spiritual thing its a body thing its a soul thing this sort of thing would probably go over just fine in a longer set but with only two sides to digest here the case mightve been better stated by letting the music speak for itself thankfully this is exactly what for does on the flipside the human voice is put to far better use this time a short bluesy sample bobbing on a gently rippling stream of slick synths it relies less on the organic jazz sounds that made citifunk memorable but is all the warmer for it tense slow-burner of mysterious haunting deep house it isnt the track id expected but more than met my high expectations for this record
kept it simple extremely simple on her 2010 album love and its opposite which found the everything but the girl chanteuse making her way through songs about aging and changing among many other attendant things the title track here from the album is typical with thorn singing over electric guitar decorated with nothing more than just a little bit of reverb (those expecting producer ewan pearson to dial in some of his many studio tricks stand to be surprised by the sparseness he employs here ) in a similar but slightly more expansive mode pairs thorns forlorn voice to a cover of a song by indie-folkie sufjan stevens about christmas its beautiful and flooringly powerful though how much a song with actual jingle bells in it stands to rate as a summer jam remains to be seen the ostensible takeaway here a remix of are a by clock winds up falling flat in comparison its mix of tinkling piano a sinuous bass-guitar groove and lightly thwacking house drums proves capable enough but its gangly and awkward in places too a sort of forced expansion of a song that didnt seem to call for it from the start
is the result of todd resnick and jesse brookes joining together with sen-sei and david coleman sen-sei and david coleman are long time west coast house producers and with todd and jesse good things should be forseen this ep is the first of the productions from the team and were featured heavily in the latest deep dish global underground long players anti-matter is a free flowing infectious beating west coast number the percussion is simple and the melody is soft and floating a short breakdown enters early and is then introduced with a groovy bassline and twanging guitars the main breakdown gives the guitar some solo time with the assistance of a short sampled vocal a variety of different echoing sounds filter in out throughout the track as the pace stays steady and the groove feels very house orientated a great summer track with many different melodic elements to satisfy the wicked track starts off with a little teaser which includes light high hats soft beats and heavenly synths as the main beat comes in the track stays slower but shows brilliant touches of groove with sustained synths short sampled and echoing vocals rain over unique rasping percussion and catchy guitar loops electro tinged synths come into play around the business part of the track as the groove stays put and leads in the track to a graceful end very smooth caliente shakes off the lightness and steps into deeper territory with a dubby eccentric track from the go get quirky piano solos pop up here and there while a booty moving bassline is introduced and takes the track to newer places more piano melodies come in and subside as the track moves into an emotional breakdown the piano is really represented here alongside the great bassline as the building of the break is teased by premature beats before finally dropping back in with all piano melodies causing a stir gorgeous house music with a deep feel overall i am very impressed with this release very smooth and very well produced

this is the latest release by recordings and has been receiving great reviews the world over and upon listening to this tune it is easy to see (or hear in this case) why side a: justin obrien + jonathans dub these guys are from the deserts of new mexico and boy can they do remixes their dub of regeneration part 2 is just quality using some nice ambient sounds to create the perfect building atmosphere before the smooth baseline kicks in the mix just flows so smoothly and is so easy to listen too not a track that takes 5 or 6 listens to before you really enjoy it although this isn t a track that really hammers it home with a huge pounding baseline it doesn t need it - its a must have for that cutting edge journey of progressive house set side b: noel sangers breaks mix noel is a veteran when it comes to production and has been releasing quality tunes for years on us labels music now and nettwerk his mix starts with a much deeper baseline together with much more of an electronic and metallic feel before blasting out its break-beat style it is a mix of quality and features amazing sounds as the track hits a mid-point before breaking back into full swing its pure quality will ensure it sees a fair bit of playtime without a doubt a vinyl to add to the collection justin obrien + jonathans dub mix on side a has already been making its mark as it has been featured on the latest bedrock compilation [ bedrock 3 mixed by chris fortier]
with his recent mix for balance deetron set out to prove that whether youre mixing digitally or with vinyl the end result is much the same here has something similar to say presenting three tracks which combine digital and analogue synthesis however given that producers have been doing that very thing for years who can say what the statement is or more to the point does anyone care as long as the musics good like all the cuts puts a lot of faith in repetition it may seem simplistic at first but headphones reveal small details struggling to creep out from beneath the weightier core elements dissonance plays a large part too; the tracks main motif is a simple set of detuned bells treated with a delay effect they bounce around the spectrum wildly and pair with amphetamine synths for a rather manic feel is a more straight-forward stomper it sounds very much like the kind of thing perc would make in fact its not just the walloping breakbeat which evokes this comparison; the dull metallic tings arranged in a regular pattern also seem very much in character lastly a mosquito-like buzzing lurks below these two louder elements bobbing in and out of earshot to make a savage patina kind of splits the difference between them it has the same throbbing back synths from but its distorted scrapes and machine groans follow the more industrial feel of
concerns of gender race and sexuality occupy the mind and music of terre thaemlitz its hard to think of an artist in the electronic domain who has so succinctly allegorised his work ignorance to the wider implications wont necessarily hamper your enjoyment of his efforts in deep house ambient or jazz though engagement will only enhance it on recordings such as the present however the message is so thinly veiled its impossible to avoid its taken from the little-known album routes not roots recorded by thaemlitz in 2006 under his kami-sakunobe house explosion (k-s h e) moniker which received a highly limited run on his own label comatose thankfully have decided to bring it to the wider public gradually through a series reissues and despite the proclamation that we are all bitches or the crude references to dicks and rectums is thaemlitz at his most irresistibly seductive its a record that threatens but never follows through its potential to break; a record that keeps you hanging to the very end on the plight of its lonely hi-hat; chords shimmy and toms bob with all the hushed tunefulness of a fiesta parade congaing slowly into the distance theres a serene soulfulness in this music that shrewdly counterbalances any coarseness in the socio-charged speech sample is more upfront in its role as a dance record there is what sounds like a sampled snippet of michael jackson repeating and no and no over and over again while walking bass and filtered percussion carry the track in classic disco fashion it has a latent groove that suffers from thaemlitz deliberate muting of the kick drum but as ever with him the tease is half the allure
re would be no more appropriate way for me to begin my review rather than to say that fabric s 20th compilation in the clubs series is anything short of incredible on this particular mix pulls together some of the best house tunes from new old to form an excellent blend of tech dub providing his listeners with a forum to enjoy some of the best music the genre has to offer with tunes like s smasher this cd has the essence of a night at fabric while keeping things from getting too clubby which makes the cd an enjoyment in your room car ipod or wherever you prefer to partake only a with the experience of can be mature enough to pick a collection of tunes that seem as if they were meant to have been mixed back to back while keeping things interesting enough to lock a listener in for over 70 minutes ll of the productions on this album are virtually perfect in form melody style groove in my opinion that is much more than i could say in many of my recent review contributions i have to admit that i have always respected but never been mr digweed s biggest fan until i gave this one a listen now i ll make it a point to put him on my must buy list in the future if this album is any indication on what we can expect from edm in than we re all in for a great year
the rising leeds producer exemplifies the volatile promiscuous tendencies currently shaping some of dance musics most exciting developments his output so far may have stuck to familiar tropes flickering garage rhythms sped-up vocal samples a whiff of sticky purple dubstep but his hybrids have never felt pro forma first single for jesse roses label is his most distinctive release yet eneath its demure outline lurks a genuine anthem albeit of warped proportions in its mastery of dynamics and its strange sing-song quality im reminded of caribous virgo four remix last year even though the tracks sound nothing alike opens with a queasy vocal duet a male alto and its mirror pitch-shifted to sound like a mewling infant robot over plunking kalimba and gentle chimes but its lullaby qualities are offset by more muscular impulses like the loop of sped-up dancehall chatter that drives it relentlessly forward with its trim jacking house groove and breathy vocal is slightly more conventional but its a fine track nonetheless; like s trkt practices a kind of pointillistic approach tracing his melodies in bold dots and filling in the empty space with faint rubbings that reward active listening prince s remix is a not-terribly-noteworthy bass-and-drums tool; david s which is better if still no patch on the original offers bouncy house flecked with carnival organ and a fringe of wah-wah guitar roskas buzzing grinding kicks-and-snares refix is the best of the three reworks magnifying the tracks manic spirit
ever since i heard richie hawtin play at sonar back in june i ve been dying to first know what it was and second get my grubby little paws on it when it finally came out this track along with s early track neural block is pro that minimal doesn t have to be cold empty music and is far from the dirty word that people these days are making it out to be here is a man who can take things to the next level and if you thought his sound had been firmly pigeonholed in the bleepy shrill whistle effects from neural block (even though that track was oh so good) proves is not one to stand still its one the most refreshing warm melodic songs i ve heard in a long time one major criticism in minimal these days is that there seems to be so much similarity going on in the sound and in a way the juxtaposes the highs and lows the current state the genre tracks such as and really are just more the same sparse clicky crisp and clinical they follow the blueprint laid out before and are quite indistinguishable from many things out there at the same time it s fair to say that s productions are just that much more a cut above the rest there is more kick in his kick drums and snap to his beats i don t know if it s his mastering his s tware (or hardware) or what but his sound is just that much purer but it s when he starts throwing in some melody and atmosphere that things really start to take f (although would some argue that this is an expansion or elaboration on strict minimal ) the shuffling peripheral sounds clapping rhythm and haunting melody on will appeal to both the head and heart my only complaint is that at six minutes it s not long enough i could easily listen to another build up and breakdown throwing those hands up in euphoric bliss this release would have made an excellent three track ep with the additions and rounding things out the first is a dark and grooving workout with a bouncy rolling bassline sharp icy hi-hats and spooky sci-fi effects straight out the 60s it s a proper ass-shaker minimal with a touch funk meanwhile delivers more a pounding 4/4 rhythm stretching out indecipherable vocals to build things nicely this will go f on the dancefloor its quality stuff from a man at the top his game this ep gets my top marks for these three tracks alone while the others although they are quality productions won t have much staying power (a problem with a lot electronic music in general) forking out 14 for the double vinyl for just one track has (almost) made me consider taking the mp3 or cdj root but fortunately this ep has some additional depth special tracks seem to be few and far between these days but (along with carola s remix r u ok ) will be in my top five this year reaffirming my faith that minus are still a force to be reckoned with

was a late 90s collaboration between louis digital and simon walley (cim) and apparently their single released on counter ttack in 1999 was a much-loved anthem at glasgows club 69 now the label dusts it f for a new era ts not hard to hear why this thing made the impact it did the 135 pm rhythm strikes the perfect balance between techno chug and electro swing; the bass and mid-range synths rattle like a broken screen door and the tunes headlong tumble is periodically interrupted by great big flashes funk straight out the prince playbook ts rough-hewn sound doesnt have the mannered quality so much contemporary lo-fi techno; instead intentionally veiling itself in static it feels like its bursting to break out its rudimentary miga tracker frame louis digitals city remix updates the track with elements from laszlo kovacs hostages for the chase manhattan released on digitals footwork label in 2002; its largely faithful to the shuddering spirit original but its ever so slightly fuller fattened up with more fluorescent chords and carefully applied reverb fleshing out the ep are two previously unreleased tracks elladona: has the emo feel early pparat but with tougher more technoid drums while nsurgency plays electro-gone-2-step drums against resonant pads and lilting vocoder whenever it was produced it doesnt sound like its aged a day
its lazy to simply say an album has great production but in the case of knowles debut full-length on fear flying it would be silly not to in a similar fashion efdemin or isolees past albums on dial and pampa is a sumptuous symphony of sound its lush and luxuriant beautifully paced and remarkably airy music that demands to be listened to closely this shouldnt really come as a surprise considering the freerotation resident and untilmyheartstops co-founder has turned out roughly 3 eps in the last decade its worth noting how well hes made the transition from ep to lp: is a standalone work that tells its own unique tale far more than than just an extended collection of tracks its deep house to be sure but its celestial and symphonic after opening with some exquisitely misty and ambient sound design things gently unfurl with the pleasantly non-linear opener rather than propelling you along a groove moves from left to right glassy droplets slowly rain down drums sway like a falling feather and squelchy synthetic textures bend and stretch like sonic goo a lonely sombreness percolates though the heavenly patter of is a bottomless bit of elegantly swung levitating house and does a fine job of bringing you back to earth with splashes of echo and rubbery drums a testament to s sense of narrative is that you almost dont notice the tempos changing from track to track each one feels perfectly natural every tune seems to stretch toward an infinite horizon tracks like koku manage to be vast and intergalactic but also personal and intimate just as you feel like youre drifting off a murmuring voice soft-focus xylophone gently trilling harp or devastating minor chord will gently tug you back to reality theres a crystal clarity to this album which in a year when so many house and techno producers are making sounds as damaged and degraded as possible is hugely refreshing
since hitting it big with his pillowy edit of destinys childs say my name bern-born vancouver-based has become the poster boy for a new wave of glossy easily-listening house music but the generic perfect form hahns first original song showed that he still had a ways to go before living up to the hype his edits generated is the first thing hahn has done that really captures the casual majesty of the r b he loves the ciara-like vocal from rochelle jordan slides effortlessly through the chorus and the track has a satin feel to it featuring a few cherry-picked vocal phrases from fellow pmr signee trades in the r b for new age aesthetics like a cross between porcelain -era moby and disclosure the tracks descending bassline is hard to resist once you get past the gushiness of it all the other two cuts are nowhere near as distinctive breakin pairs a knock-off coma cat bassline with swooning kerri chandler synths more an assemblage of deep house clich s than a song proper and as the only track without vocals feels so slight that it almost feels pointless including it might as well be the title of the ep though and show hahns personality starting to peek through the other two are so perfunctory that they feel like they came off a deep house assembly line
has been beefing up its roster lately dropping label debuts from m nic shao yanpeng and psyk in the past year ir latest is aka parisian producer sylvain peltier who runs construct re-form and has appeared on the likes of syncrophone and deeply rooted peltier trades in a sleek ultra-focused sort of techno: melody comes in shards and bursts rather than big synth lines and his djing is tracky and linear is another rock-solid entry in his catalogue with one standout track backed by two competent workouts title track is one of s boldest its basslines sounding like burned-out reeses taken from a 90s techstep jam just when you think the tune has locked into a groove peltier drops a bleeping synth that twinkles like a sky full of stars opening up a whole new side of its packed with percussion with every element going full-bore almost all the time and yet its full of dynamic touches wait for the end when he drops jackhammer kicks flipside is more composed and has peltier playing the long game with repetitive pieces is a utilitarian slow-burner with ostgut ton-style chord modulation while highlights peltiers ability to wring melody from the sparest of sounds (in this case some high-pitched resonance that hangs above the track like a fog) what these latter two lack in personality they make up for in functionality the kind of modern no-nonsense techno wed expect from a 12-inch
following a breakout effort for madtech earlier this year returns to the label he co-runs arrives on white a platform for bootlegs edits and more melodic tracks thats not to say that is some wispy lightweight exercise its a somewhat melancholic house/bass hybrid with a hollow conga weaving in and out of a screeching soul sample marvin gayes romping paean to sex lets get it on and a smattering of classic chicago house-style handclaps while the lead track is more headphone music pes remix redresses the balance with a techy workout the vocal gets throttled the congas are drenched in echo and a scowling attack of percussion pounds it into submission
s stock is on the rise after their excellent caffine release on trapez late last year and this four-tracker on the new label from polish compatriots 3channels should do lukasz seligia no harm at all has his trademark swing (um can you have a trademark after five releases ) and its busy nestled amongst the detailed drums and key-changing chord washes is something unexpected: a surprisingly funky deep house bassline that changes the character of the track bringing some unexpected boompty but making proceedings a bit too hectic fabrycnza is trackier the intricate swing is present again (see ) but the darker bass synth scrapes and 303 dabs tone things down full marks for the ominous string surges which jacek focuses on for his murky weird mix: the aggressive staccato percussive elements and gloopy fx/fills are in stark contrast to the mesmerising glockenspiel that drifts in near the end an unusual take on a fairly standard club track so that should be applauded mike shannon strips back into a usable jacking tech-houser

longside stanislav tolkachev holds pride of place in the upper echelons of the modern techno pantheon both artists embody the genres sensibilities while also sounding distinct from the hordes of phoned-in techno tracks that swamp the market and theyve both spawned a number of imitators but where tolkachev carves close to the bone with his deranged psychedelic style balances emotive atmospheres with an imposing sense of space and scale (just check out the second breakdown in nd when the sky opened or words of silences ) this verges on a big-room sound though its bereft of the ostentatious overtones generally associated with the term regardless of how hes described is deep in the habit of producing sure-shot weapons with undeniable momentum and weight on saudade the french producers second ep for rolls out his signature style percolating sixteenth notes rake like claws through sandy soil as storm heads of harmony loom out of the background ready to envelop the mix the low-end seems to emphasise every quaver which helps give its galloping gait the beats re-entry after the break is classic : he pushes the atmospheric elements through reams of feedback and skillfully controls the dynamics for maximum contrast and impact by comparison drift packs a more gravelly texture and flashing effects it has a considerable shock-and-awe factor but s surprises here come from sleight of hand and top-notch sound design rather than sensory overload elements race by making you wonder what the hell you just heard saudade is certainly among s finest work but then again his entire back catalog is essential listening for any techno fan

h today seems different it feels like were going to have a quiet uneventful and peaceful day vocal sample repeats these words a few times and then losouls trademark drums kick in these are familiar and reassuring drums reminding you that germanys peter kremier has been knocking out his unique brand of skeletal house for a remarkable thirteen years the off-kilter percussion on is a direct descendent of classics such as soul down and raw eauty despite the initial promise of an uneventful and peaceful day theres a lot happening on this record: squeaky springs bounce like the busted shocks on some old pickup truck a few whipping metallic sounds quiver in the background and garbled vocal samples drift across the top each sound is carefully defined and given its moment to shine fleshing out a playful song that gradually moves from initial cartoon slapstick into some serious robo-funk is anything but gridlocked the track races at a decent clip propelled by a simple one-note keyboard stab and a wonderfully extended sub-bass the dense percussion clatters along peppered with a few scuffed-up vocal clips of laughter and the old standby pronouncement of bass one of s greatest powers is his ability to create minimal tracks that are neither gloomy nor academic which is more difficult than it sounds y putting a bit of spin on the tail of a chord or dropping in a brassy squiggle every few measures his tracks stand out in a genre thats often joyless s tracks usually grin from ear to ear and is no exception
rush hour just wants it dont they here they are rolling over from the year of their lives with a disco track thats both giddy and restrained like a very smart dress that happens to look like a birthday cake theres definitely an ibizan breeze blowing through s new one though it never gets totally barefoot in the head your moves are limited on sand and is definitely meant for moving that dual quality comes out especially well as the instrumental flourishes grow wilder swelling analog synth slow-rising dub boing fx over a groove that evokes expensive 80s synths as easily as it does hideously expensive 70s ones the dub ups the drama here trago puts everything through just enough filtering to make itself present but not the focus tweaking the basic elements till they glow and smear like neon in the rain suddenly at about 3:10 everything slowly disintegrates and the graininess of the sound reveals itself; when the instruments come back theyre in focus for a while but soon things muddy again its a roller-coaster and the side a lot of djs prefer i do too ut this release is as much a triumph of foundation as abstraction
rohan ell-towers has had these two tracks up his sleeve since at least 2009 that theyve been dormant for a couple of years doesnt really matter; theyd sound just at home in 1990 as they would now neither are indebted to chicago; they are chicago ig bassline-driven house with gaudy bits of rapture woven in goes heavier on the rapture than its partner layering 8-bit chirps staccato bells and flurries of rim shots onto its grumbling low end lowers the tempo and turns down the lights getting even fatter and funkier when only the bass and percs are playing it also sounds uncannily like coma cat mostly due to a tinging triangle the rapture isnt totally missing however this time it comes in the form of tinny strings which slide into the gaps between the huge low-end throb pparently this is the ustralians debut lets hope the next one doesnt take two years as well
p next on is a duo from denmark that goes by the name of ignition and they invade the label with their next release in free my soul on the a-side is lawler s locked harlem edit i must say that i was quite disappointed with this edit as it doesn t really change or add too much to the original mix that is on the b-side apart from leave out the great string patterns that was a highlight of the original mix this edit perhaps caters for those that like it dark and deep for the entirety rather then the original mix that has a little more variety in the production on the flip is the original mix chunky deep tribal house is probably the best way to describe this production the beats are quite solid and very chunky and the percussive elements are quite nice the big dark vocal doesn t add too much to the production however the nicely arranged string patterns that come deep into the production add a great touch to a deep pounding track for the most part not a bad release at all on this sub label of harlem and for me the original mix is where the beauty lies
most longtime fans wont be surprised to learn that halha (20 years of ) isnt your conventional retrospective for starters label essentials female and portion reform are nowhere to be found nstead we get tracks from artists like who has never appeared on before and k and mick harris who have only released material on related imprints zeitgeist and resonance staple better known as surgeon does make an appearance but its an uncharacteristic chunk of electronic experimentation called which was originally released on the unaffiliated label slut smalls s for label proprietor karl oconnor k he contributes just a substance version of the 1996 cut pparently oconnor prefers to spotlight fresh faces such as o ke and both of whom have made their debuts within the last year despite halha being more of an odds sods kind of thing oconnors programming is subtle and effective in telling his labels story though all of them are rare or previously unreleased these nine tracks form a balanced picture of the part techno part post punk sound created over the years just get a load of side : pulled from one of the very first slabs of vinyl he ever released s has nothing to do with techno whatsoever it sounds more inspired by early neue deutsche welle side then moves on to s austere workout in rhythmic noise and the aforementioned substance remix latter is one of halha s most formal expressions of techno yet its built from components that echo the d y electronics and industrial elements found in the previous two tracks sets most thorough embodiment of aesthetic might be sleeparchives version of a piece from oconnors current collaboration with avant garde composer russell haswell original which appeared in ugust on the duos 12 inch for p n is hulking and dense and the way its put into lurching motion feels of a piece with the current wave of pummeling technoise with his remix however master sound architect sleeparchive shapes the bruiser into something elegant and functional ll those leaden textures are now carefully tempered with lost in space atmospherics the lurch transformed into a cruising altitude propulsion one whose sublime automation is loyal to technos core precepts chances are good halha will soon prove to be as rare an acquisition as most of the titles that came before it fter all appears to pride itself on product exclusivity but if you fancy yourself a connoisseur of modern cutting edge electronic music its pretty damn essential

sometimes it takes an outsider to spice up the sound of the moment new frankfurt label has found one in a little-known producer apparently based somewhere in michigan on which is said to be his first release rooge offers a welcome take on the increasingly breaks- and electro-focused sound many producers rooted in minimalist dance music have recently turned to eschewing complex breakbeats and zipping synths rooge lays down three pumping peak-time bombs all as functional as they are enchanting that is so clearly aimed at a busy dance floor sets it apart from much of the music being released by labels in s sphere (check the slinky electro of fellow frankfurt outlet traffics latest release for a more abstract example) across the ep beats are swung but slamming matched with heaving basslines and cheery melodies its fun music that retains an experimental edge a combination that rarely comes together so effectively (if youve never danced to the sound of a dial-up modem will give you the chance ) whether rooge is a real outsider or someone familiar in disguise signals the arrival of yet another frankfurt label helping shape the sound of an increasingly exciting corner of dance music
s name may not be well-known at the moment but give it a little bit of time: jus-ed marcel dettmann and others have been relentlessly pushing his excellent recent work on novel sound and now in their sets a sign that after many years of hard work in the trenches of underground new york house music that his time may finally be upon us ed and dettmann are unlikely co-supporters but vincents debut on deconstruct is a prime example of why the producers music works for both is nominally restrained in its 120 pm plod building momentum like a steam engine with hissy hi-hats finding their way beneath the pounding syncopated beat vincent drops in dub clouds halfway in and its at this moment that his mo is clear: this is overwhelming dub house music that creeps up on you and before you realize it completely envelops you in its clutches the works similarly taking 12 minutes to unfold its magic like its companion on the flip the rhythm relies on a hypnotic repetition to pull you in and then adds in tour de france -esque breathing and other assorted sonic detritus to make sure youre still paying attention ed uses it slowly taking advantage of the epic groove that vincent builds while dettmann piles other dub(step)-inspired techno around it quickly and seamlessly i use it as background music around the home ll three seem to work pretty much brilliantly
res a sense of irony on the latest release having famously professed that everything must change/nothing stays the same it was house hero mike dunns 1997 collaboration with victor simonelli and luis radio that caught the playful eye of marc romboy who subsequently chose it for the labels celebrated lost treasures remix series enlisting french tech-houser f e x and ratio music boss melon mike dunns fluid original was destined to be nipped tucked and twisted for a contemporary crowd f e x relieves the of its pattering drums replacing them with crisp modern kicks and just the right amount of percussion to give the foundations a necessary rolling swing he does well to leave dunns raspy vocals intact setting them over soft strings and intermittent bursts of frisky hi-hats just over halfway through the records nine-minute build a slow cascading synth slips in adding a warm closing touch to this patient effectual refix melon goes for darker sweatier confines constructing his own menacingly groovy alternative to the originals commanding bassline tight mirrored synths sit snugly atop dunns vocals hit with just enough reverb and delay to give them and the track a more profound spectral hue melon weaves a sonic tapestry so raw and engaging itll have you championing change at every turn
its unlikely theres much of a competitive streak between leon vynehall and who together make up the twisted house act laszlo dancehall but if there is it must be raging like a bushfire right now last month leon vynehall unleashed one of the years best house eps music uninvited on latest outing for his own sourceunknwn imprint the brighton producer is in similarly good form cross the three tracks piers rustles up snarling sharp-elbowed house lead cut may sounds like the title of some edward lear nonsense rhyme (to say nothing of the oliver sacks classic ) but its target is clearly defined this is a peak-time bullet fired with pinpoint accuracy with snares that snap your neck back a generous bass wobble and a warped synth hook is brawnier still a marble-tough slab of swinging house with a tech edge opens with a puppyish bounce and scuttle but is then draped in deliciously warm chords and spluttering toms bringing to a close a highly accomplished ep t this rate the next laszlo dancehall record should be quite something
its only been seven months since bryan kasenic launched yet the label has already developed a distinct aesthetic kasenic has kept up a steady stream of releases since january most of which were helmed by bunker regulars and recorded at the party that alternate between experimental synth or dub-oriented jams and trance-inducing dub techno burners labels sixth offering which comes from bunker affiliate and fashion designer falls neatly into the latter category although the press materials say that shuttles meticulous approach appeals to music cognoscenti across the globe the record contains two tracks with enough hypnotic functionality to extend its appeal beyond the realm of connoisseurs that being said shuttles productions are definitely meticulous each element on the a-side is fine-tuned to undergo subtle changes in texture and tone kick drum progresses from a blunted pulse to a throbbing stomp and an eerie extended synth tone slides in and out of focus between grumbling instrumental blasts that occasionally gain a calloused edge rustles up a similarly ominous mood but with a more purposeful momentum dark piano chords give the track a dramatic vibe which is enhanced by reverb-soaked drip-drop noises and a spiky bleep melody drums hit harder here especially the hi-hats which add an extra neck-jerking thrust that doesnt have making it the slightly more effective half of an engrossing release
newly-formed fritz lang consists of n e stofenmacher whose releases on igloo-rec are often along the lines of what might happen if yo la tengo used a sampler and francois touin a professional synth head its a pairing which lends itself with precious idiosyncrasy to the kind of disco house you might hear in a mix these days from airdrop regulars soul clap generally the duo meld benoit and sergio-esque verses with the soily texture of their meeting point lyons infine label but despite the amount of experience that each track seems to have taken in they almost seem to have been made by separate people whereas the title track is a silky deep house groover centred around honied subversive pop vocals is markedly more brittle taking interesting electro patches building precise rhythmic scaffolding around them then changing them all on a whim meanwhile is low slung americana with what sounds like a pitched down jews harp its always quirky but never weird dance floor-approved remixes should help get the attention of a wider audience maya refix as usual is classic and well-formed as she gives the original more deepness warmth and a ravey edge whereas her style fits in comfortably with fritz langs feadz reaches out further taking the listener in a cartoon spaceship to the moon with only a hardcore rave vol 3 tape and blaster from transformers to play it its a common-sense marketing proposition for an all-digital release considering their workmanship though a nice vinyl with just the originals would have made even more sense
re is taking your time then there is really taking your time for instance has been producing tracks from his brooklyn flat for imprints as diverse as ralph lawsons 20:20 vision prins thomas internasjonal since the early 00s but hes only now releasing his debut full-length chaconas production often falls between the sleek tech-house of 20:20 the disco-tinged balearica of internasjonal its no different on this outing for the rlin-based oozes a polished sense of refinement overall elegance yet struggles at the same time with finding it own distinctiveness take for instance a collaboration with n -discos own femme fatale its a gorgeously sultry song as miss has accustomed us to but from the title down to the breathy vocal delivery the evasive mention of vaguely fearful emotions it sounds exactly like the work shes recorded in the past two years with toby tobias ( feeling ) aeroplane ( whispers ) permanent vacation dudes ( tic toc ) same can be said for a track that resembles lindstr m at his most restrained which is evidently touted from its 10-minute length as the albums pi ce de r sistance whose uplifting piano cant help but recall aeroplanes own caramellas impressive references for sure but chacona doesnt do enough to make these anything more than reverential that said current single is ornamented with an unexpected yet subtle acidic bass line the kind of welcomed attention to detail you also find on with its soft yet stabbing bassline arpeggiated synths or on album closer its circumvallating samples this is where chaconas decade-long studio experience is showcased to staggering effect indulging the tech-house side of his sound palette the producer also graces us with the g to differ remix of which is included as a bonus on the cd se are the kinds of old-school house cuts that wouldnt sound out of place on the last dj t album or in a solomun dj set indeed if you exclude the dub almost reggae-like eskayelato has a consistency a homogenous beach-y breezy serene house feel compared to recent albums it also seems to gracefully ride the middle ground between the dance floor experience the home listening one all thats left to do for chacona is to indulge his more typically personal distinctive traits not wait another ten years to do so

when hudson mohawke and lunice released their self-titled collaborative ep as tnght in 2012 there was at least one thing about those instrumental trap beats that everyone could agree on: their sample banks were bonkers baby coos 8-bit portamento hooks 15-year-old house vocals water droplets ridiculously oversized drums twisted radio rap fx it was all enough to kick off a trend in populist edm-friendly beatmaking that is yet to subside a denver-based producer who recently signed with xl is the latest ripple to rise from tnght s massive splash but thats not to call him a newcomer or uninspired mimic now 26 kyle reid has produced for hip-hop duo gorgeous children since late 2012 and had his solo tracks (made early on as gila monsta) shared by the likes of luckyme the time hes spent working with and without an mc serves his first official solo release well: genkidama s four productions reveal a proficiency for unique ear-catching sound design and songcraft alike lead track sets a strong precedent with disembodied whispers repurposed for a beat that splits the difference between trip- and hip-hop nothing else on genkidama is so romantic though quickly moves the ep into the trenches where its all alien gibberish funeral bells and busted drum samples dont a spooky hulking head-knocker that opened reids boiler room debut earlier this year eliciting whoops from the audience when its depth-charge kick finally dropped sticks to that space with its stifling humidity and fluid voodoo groove aside from the most melodic of the bunch is whose tender piano chords are genkidama s only discernible instrument on an ep as crazed and cryptic as this though theres little so surprising as an untreated sound
uk breakbeat label records is proud to present a new remix series - bringing down the house which showcases breakbeat remixes of classic house tunes done by the current cream of the crop producers as a bonus have also included the original tune with the package to satisfy the appetites of nostalgia buffs first up on this series is s with christian j on the remix side a christian j remix known for his dirty growling basslines christian j takes the tune and drops in a bouncy 4 to the floor beat with eager kick drums to give it a gallopy effect the intro features a massive acid build up before getting into a catchy melodic bass line and big balearic synth lines lots of squeaks bleeps and techy stabs used for good measure from what can be heard christian subtly uses the latin break and beatbox from the original its a big bassline monster and yet has a nice summery vibe to it side b original as implied by the title the tune is a big carnival tune which (like most latin numbers) features plenty of whistles a latin percussion break horn stabs and a feel good piano riff apparently the tune was released back in the early nineties and embraces the house style of the era its a fun tune and quite interesting to hear what was going on in house music back when i was about 12

jorg burger rivals wolfgang voigt as the producer with the largest number of pseudonyms and projects (ambient techno as triola beatless ambient as geometric farms electro-guitar pop as trinkwasser and hard minimal as pop up amongst others) but the modernist remains his favoured moniker regardless of style his productions glisten like the sunniest pop tune helped by a fondness for guitars chiming synth tones and voices shot through vocoders thus its not surprising to find his first mix cd titled the premiere release on stefan struevers collectors series struever was responsible for the dj kicks compilations and in burger they have found a kindred spirit to continue their anything-goes enthusiasm recalls erland oyes jovial dj kicks set with burger gleefully following oyes amusing dj rules: keep them dancing ensure it s well ventilated and make them think youre a rock star theres also a heavy dose of superpitcher-inspired microgoth miserablism which offset against burgers delight in spit and polish results in much revelling in heartbreak the vocals appear on every track but theyre gasped moaned or breathed through processors closer musiks introduction to 1 2 3 (no gravity) starts things off all heady atmosphere and expectation before the chiseled beats of mikkel metals microho are introduced snatches of surf guitar washed beside a drowning vocal vocals appear on every cut gasped moaned and effected to add further hints of troubled romance burger runs through a collection of favourites er popular classics and a few exclusives of his own: freifeld as triola a brief snatch of trademark burger shudder; and the plucked guitar and female vocals of autobianchis stay the modernists protest song adds unpleasantly over-processed male voices to thickly sliced clangs but mushroom angels his mash-up of superpitchers even angels and mushroom is glorious taking the best moments of each and piling on additional piano chords - a la happiness - burger somehow manages to eclipse both tracks with this simple exercise adas livedriver is given the burger treatment by b movement subtly enhancing the original without overwhelming it; elsewhere telepopmusiks breathe sends words through am radio hiss to emerge wistful and yearning and erland oye with morgan geist cuts through the dominant fog and static with sharp electro gestures lamenting lost youth and singing about car crashes superpitchers mix of dntels this is the dream of evan and chan makes another - welcome and fitting - appearance repair provides two pleasingly hazy numbers and basic channels round two gets remembered before the album closes jarringly with scritti polittis the boom boom bap paradoxically for an album so united in mood there are some rough transitions but thats a minor quibble where the chief concern is delivering quality songs well assume it was mixed digitally as there is not a crease to be found and digital perfection is more in line with the modernists futurist ethos for a fine collection of cologne inspired techno pop look no further
loosely characterised by an inebriated instrument-rich circus company vibe this debut organic ep from french newbie slz starts on a high but wanes from there on in opener is great striking a nice pose between deep and disheartened house thanks to its lingering trumpet and slo-mo bumpy beats however is rather indulgent at over ten minutes long largely coming across like the microhouse sounds of seuil gain forlorn trumpets are the focus but this time the digitalised melodies and busy off-time percussive crashes detract from the solemnity a touch too much meanwhile veers off into well-produced but functional dance floor territory with choppy drums cartoon blobs of melodic colour and undulating organ chords recalling the late-night japery of dop before digital-only bonus blitch ensures things end somewhere altogether more interesting s a pleasing patchwork of plummeting bass notes glitchy claps and vocal snatches that build to a plump funky and higgledy-piggledy peak ten (again ) minutes later enough to keep slz on the radar for sure
returns to to deliver yet another set of remixes of material culled from his 2006 lp drowning in sea of love this time out fake has chosen the track for the remix treatment and the results are patchy at best pproximating the heavy-handed grandiosity of m83 s awkward marriage of shoegaze and synth pop and featuring the sort of quiet/loud dynamic that one might expect to find on a mogwai album is hardly material for the dancefloor somehow though four a producer not exactly known for the quality of his remixes manages to rein in the beat transforming the mix into a wide-eyed shuffler that is both surprisingly propulsive and unexpectedly excellent fake s own live remix attempts to imbue the track with the energy of his techier productions grafting a dirty beat to the original s bubbling electronics and chopping the melody to bits unfortunately it never quite seems to gel and fizzles out disappointingly near the seven-minute mark thankfully his live remix of another track taken from drowning in sea of love is more successful featuring a cloud of chirping tones and sliced accordion samples floating atop a funky kick pattern the mix brings to mind a toned down version of samim s heater if heard at the right moment las it s too little too late leaving this ep feeling like a mere stopgap while we wait for fake to start churning out those dancefloor monsters again
is a tease kieran hebdens ruse on this mini-album is to make you think a breakdown is coming make you crave it then draw away when you want it to arrive in the hands of someone less talented this could easily fail miserably but such is hebdens understanding of how the game works you wonder if he wasnt a stripper in a previous life these four tracks also suggest his regular sets at bugged out at the end in london appear to have (re)awoken his dancey side: they are hebdans most clubby cuts since she moves she on his 2003 album rounds the style is still very much - organic folksy cute and eccentric electronic music - but comes with lashings of effects reminiscent of tongues his recent collaboration with veteran drummer steve reid throughout are scattered little loops of machines cheerfully purring and cooing blissfully unaware theyre part of a dastardly plot to wind up the listener for and that plot is to eek out enough of a tune to earn your interest but (of course) never drop the whole thing on hebden unwraps a gorgeous melody played on a triangle throws in hi-hats then finally a big indie synth line which almost immediately drifts away on what sounds like a physics lab oscillator keeps tensions high while drums and fragments of other songs shuttle in and out it promises the most but youve guessed it is the one that stays furthest from giving you what you want the title track is one occasion when you do get a breakdown for just 12 bars following eight minutes of something that sounds like a cross between an old carl craig record and a john carpenter soundtrack you get 32 seconds of heavy drum bliss all in all this a great release that despite its brevity gets more rewarding with each listen it s a bit like sitting in on the wolfgang tillmans piece lights ( ) which is a gallery installation of club lights with an accompanying techno track which keeps on building but never drops after sitting through it for twenty minutes you find yourself smiling through gritted teeth
s nosmo ruin and mcrae first got the worldwide recognition they have long deserved when their self-released track entitled one for the road was dropped by sasha on the live at wmc essential mix since then the trio have gone on to work with such prestigious labels as hope recordings and polyester just to name a few also a recent guest slot appearance on john digweed s kiss fm radio show couldn t hurt either their latest release starts off with asleep at the wheel - a tune that if nothing else is guaranteed to jolt awake anyone driving home after a late night out at the clubs beginning with atmospheric sounds layered over a simple kick drum things begin to take off when the massive bass line drops what follows is a peak time tune with breakdowns thrown in at all of the right places asleep at the wheel is serious business for any dj looking to get the crowd off their seats onto the dance floor the flipside offers the designated mix of the tune that first got the trio s name noticed on an international scale one for the road while asleep at the wheel is undoubtedly a peak time stormer this tune fits perfectly at either the beginning of a set or as the night is winding down and the sun begins to rise featuring layered synths over a solid break beat; it s no wonder that this track has earned a permanent home in many dj s record boxes find themselves among a group of chicago producers such as pat foosheen and naveen g who continue to find their works showing up on the very best record labels this release is a good reason why that is be sure to look out for a remastered original version of one for the road along with a gabriel and dresden remix on hope recordings in january also make sure to look out for their upcoming track yewminyst which will be featured on the upcoming nick warren global underground compilation and should see a spring 2003 release on hope
makes another return to the mantra label with you may remember this same production got release a few months back as a limited one sided release this time it returns with the original as well as a dj tool and a remix that adds a new touch on the a-side is firstly the original mix this of course was the peak time disco house track that had similar features to so much love to give with filtered synths accompanying a vocal sample as well as some more progressive synths and driving baselines the padappella follows this on the a-side and features some of the filtered synths that feature in the original as well as the vocal snippet it s a dj tool that could come in handy at some point on the flip is the santos vs frusta dub gone are the filtered house vibes as the track gets transformed into a chunky house number the beats get thicker and the baselines heavier in this reworking that also sees the vocal play a minimal role compared to the original it is quite heavy on the whole and is meant for late night activity one would probably suggest not a bad release yet again by mantra re-releasing this house anthem with a nice tougher edge

the last time presented us with a solo effort on his own freak n chic imprint was way back in 2008 deliciously twisted garden ep and while year-plus sabbatical havent done his talents any harm at all its perhaps not quite release his fans have been waiting for dont get me wrong is good while same sense of creeping menace that saturated so many of his earlier productions is still present its now overlaid with a newfound sense of optimism akin to a manic depressives dawning realisation that re is indeed light at end of tunnel is a far cry from what anyone would dare refer to as upbeat though it starts with warped sirens reverb-soaked hats and muttered vocals but bassline is pretty lively and guitar-like stabs add a definite sweetness the problem is that it hasnt quite made up its mind what it wants to be: moody or jolly and as a result it fails to fully hit mark on ei r level with o r two tracks its hard not to notice influence of a fellow freak n chic-er the bassline and warped vocals of are so shonky-esque its hard to believe he wasnt in studio making his influence felt too has an unnervingly familiar quality to it and while both tracks are solid deep/tech house numbers with s haunting pads and nicely-picked vocals marking it out as stronger of two it all feels a little bit been re done that

with original copies of the kenya installment going for over 100 on discogs and future editions planned s world series project has some pretty serious wind at its back recorded by esa williams and auntie flo (aka brian dsouza) during the 2014/ doadoa music conferences in jinja uganda is the last of three editions that were originally planned and features collaborative tracks with local musicians as with the cuba and kenya releases the effortless way the duos talents mesh with those of the locals is striking especially when considering that in many cases the collaborations started only moments after the artists met for the first time makadem one of the musicians featured on the kenya release recently told me how esas club honed production abilities could make traditional n instruments interesting to young ns and this ep sounds like another winning example s kula 12 is just about the highlight with a glow added to the busy foreground of horns percussion and overlaid chants s doadoa14 is the jazzy rhodes washed vehicle for a passionate male vocal the voice that leads both versions of by and is even more of an earworm though the extended mix and behrs quietly ominous remix deliver a less clubby second half on this varied package where the world series will go from here is unknown but given the first three installments its hard not to be excited at the prospect of more

is not known for his funk: his brooding productions tend to be more concerned with weight and sinister atmosphere but in his best moments the young producer achieves a kind of austere grooviness moulding negative space into seductive new shapes this quality is played down on the ep perhaps tectonic boss pinch was drawn to productions more similar to his own house-tempo music which often relies on bass pressure and brute force to carry it forward the result at least on is frustrating the tracks cavernous spaces and thoughtfully arranged percussion are standard-issue and theres an impressive heft to its whooshing bassline whats lacking is propulsion; all of a sudden the 10 bpm difference between s music and the dubstep he references is painfully apparent better is in which a carefully repositioned rim shot causes the beat to flicker between moody abstraction and a ghoulish garage flex the tracks bass stabs are like ice cubes down the neck and the wisps of backwards vocal wafting over the second drop call to mind shackleton at his bleakest on meanwhile ramps up the tempo for a stab at contemporary drum bass perhaps it should come as no surprise that he sounds just as polished and proficient at this new tempo if anything his sometimes-ponderous music benefits from the injection of energy

rather than the more intricate tech house he often specialises in s new release on is stripped and solid deep house the sounds here all have brushed and scuffed surfaces and are layered with the sort of dust you scrape off an old vhs tape thats been aging in the attic theres not a single hat or clap thatll make you think plug-in or loop pack anywhere each one seems custom made for this ep has an enticing boom-bap backbone that might sound like mike denhert doing deep house peeling off it are rigid techno rattles and more inviting human coos a catchy combination pairs grinding machine funk with melted dub techno chords while is the least serious of the three thanks to tropical percussion lazy smeared synths and a keen melodic undulation you might have a hard time pinning any of these to one specific producer but that doesnt mean they wont bang in some sweaty little basement
the oddly named is chris shively aka chicago footwork purveyor chrissy murderbot his two outings under the name have showcased shivelys less frenetic side delving into soul and disco treated with some tongue-in-cheek ghetto flourishes the facially focused sample that adorns pass it around for instance for his debut on this energy blends with the garage-house palette alex joness label has cornered in the last couple of years isnt a record that revels in subtlety and its strongest moments are when shively wrestles with a fistful of ideas in cant its when his gnarly acid squelch almost becomes a hardcore hoover as drums clomp beneath police sirens speeches and cheering crowds on its when a groovy electro bassline is subjected to bongo breakdowns and a stilton-strong jazz funk riff closer loops its title over warehouse-ready stabs and then suddenly ups the ante with a throbbing bassline its the same trick on and both seem like theyre going to be rote garage-house jams but shively cant keep his face straight for long the former morphs from croydon basslines into shrieking rave synths all stitched to a two-step shuffle and the latters sudden whistles betray a sense of humour when so much house is narrow-focused and po-faced an injection of anything-goes fun should be gratefully received
does a rags to riches story ever fail to generate a bit of interest in an artist one day theyre broke and trying to set up a label and the next day their demo falls into the hands of a big cheese who sets them on the road to the bigtime hails from romania and his story is pretty similar ever since the day dj hell signed him to gigolo in 2004 a bit of a jack of all trades mihai has produced electro-pop disco and italo his music has sounded like a balkan answer to alden tyrell at times this time round however he decides to ditch the electro/italo drift and get his tech house on for pascal feos it seems is betting on a newbie the title track couldnt be further from the standard electro/depressed male vocal swagger of mihai s in the dark track trancey germanic techno is the order of the day here and the rhythm end actually sounds purposeful early on picking up a spooky synth and a driving bassline to pretty average effect it must be said is this what happens when someone jumps ship but actually ends up in the deep end out of their depth in a particular genre on the plus side there s an appealing timbre to it if that kind of thing is important to you on the flip is actually a shade worse taking things down an even more predictable route this sounds like watered-down tech-trance and really isnt worth the time it takes to cue it up on your turntable there must be a million records that sound like this so why bother does a little to save the day a poor mans gabriel ananda it isn t completely throwaway with a skippy beat and modulating synths but by the midpoint its evidently going nowhere fast there s a moral in this story: like the clich says best to stick to what you know best this is not up to the feos standard at all a poor release from

when originally appeared on kitsun maison volume 6 last year with debut single re was something definitely eccentric about m (yeah are a duo kids not just a pale chick with a avant-garde leaning hairdresser) especially when you put m next to average blog-house hopefuls kitsun is too often sponsor of elly jacksons voice immediately attracted attention to itself with maneuvers that evoked atrical excesses of both bj rk and karin dreijer andersson but with added glossy familiarity of robyns recent offerings needless to say piano-backed was a welcomed anomaly on a scene known throw-away hype-bound nature of its productions a success duo gladly repeated with follow-up single (and its highly celebrated lets get ravey remix courtesy of skream) and current mini-hit all included on an eponymous first album that may be next to ciao and hands finest and most tuneful synth pop album youre likely to hear all year thanks to ben langmaids well-crafted button pushing and jacksons quirky yet ardent lyricism is packed with three-minute electro nuggets that beg repeated listens the album version of a ementioned was always an obvious chart-topper with an overtly twee melody strangely backed by more elaborate vocal arrangements; on o r hand comes across as a tamer (and more na ve) take on beth dittos feminist-tinged bravado but is no less lovable this feeling is also reflected on im this time with more breakbeat-like asperities while buzzes with sort of synths that mid-career human league would have been proud of on electronic torch song duo even brings london community gospel choir added pathos; yet as fitting as it sounds ir inclusion cant help but also feel a bit superfluous considering song was strong enough without fanfare in first place that at end of day is s greatest strength: the fact that you get struck by songwriting on practically every track is a rarity in contemporary electro pop but with likes of tiga little boots calvin harris and frankmusik all hitting at same time its not so much case anymore you can now also add to that list as well
deepchord were already refiners when they started building on the dub techno blueprint set out in berlin res nothing wrong with refinement of course and after left the duo in 2002 rod modell went on to make some of the most beloved dub techno of the 00s res a point though beyond which a formula cant get any more elegant its execution more slick during the 15 years in which schommer didnt release a record dub techno lodged so firmly in the dance music vernacular that its now inscribed in technology with an ableton soft synth preset and the ping pong delay plug-in you can whip up a passable dappled dub chord in five minutes flat on parts of schommers comeback record it sounds like hes done just that which isnt to say that sounds like the work of a beginner its faultless in the way that uninspired music with technology on its side and years of genre tradition to draw on can be each track has the requisite creamy chords the crisp drums and pillow-smooth low-end arranged in comforting patterns and gleaming like moulded plastic is the downtempo number with its head-nod halftime its the offspring of basic channels no partial in the way that pretenders to a throne might claim distant descent from some mythical king centrepiece is a cheesy minor-key melody played on a synth horn crinkled with digital distortion the straighter techno number is also marred by a misjudged melody a prim four-note thing drenched in tasteful delay frames similar materials with a stiff broken beat rhythm like the others its not that bad if you can ignore the empty look in its eyes
s meteoric rise after a few years among teutonic house musics fringes is attributable to one single moment: gloriously melodic ridiculously tuneful year began in january with its release on the permanent vacation its renown has kept growing throughout to a point where its now ubiquitous but somehow not overplayed s this unique quality that makes it seem like marco niemerski has his tasteful finger on the proverbial pulse something that is also apparent on his first commercially available mix niemerskis choice of defected as the label outlet might appear to some like a counterintuitive one judging by the results though it simply shows how comfortably he can navigate the integrity spectrum if we follow s selection for instance its clear hes well in touch with his n disco contemporaries s being a perfect mood setting opener fluences can range from the truly vintage (the kenny remix of s dont ) or fully derivative ( s own comes across as a lost taylor ne b side) but it always feels appropriate inspired re is a slight pause in the flow right after s soulful cant then the mix enters its proper n disco phase with the sub genres current virtuosos: remixes from the always reliable tuff hot the scenes vocal muse shows up on s preposterous but strangely uplifting the first disc finally ends on the brilliant stylistic match between s lost yet visionary (from the almost decade old total compilation) the twirling lindstr m pris remix of this is crate digging connection drawing ing at its most compelling second disc is more upbeat presenting niemerskis deep knowledge of the current vintage house canon highlights are aplenty but the remarkably rousing still remix of s the pounding by the thunderously bass heavy motor drum ensemble re reading of pt are remarkably uplifting thomos edit of s 988 understated classic dont is house music at its most basic operative (its presence here only somewhat diminished by the fact it has also already been used by the likes of roman fl gel paul woolford juan maclean on their own mixes earlier this year) technically speaking some transitions on both discs are a bit rough around the edges at times the slight reediting of the intro is completely unnecessary but these are minor blemishes on an overall spot on selection is currently walking a fine line between popular recognition underground trustworthiness but shows him doing so without compromising his insight or his artistry while he is currently being playlisted by radio pushed by defected in the uk he also appears on the latest permanent vacation bugged compilations making the apparently irreconcilable seem totally natural
two releases in already looks like an inspired source of dusky leftfield techno run by onetake a leipzig dj with ties to conne island the label first appeared last year with a reissue of lynxs call an overlooked electro classic repackaged with an edit from kassem mosse in december it introduced an as-yet-unknown artist named with an ep as artfully bleak as its sleeve design begins with its title track a 14-minute sprawl that sounds like it could have been done on the fly with just a few machines throbbing away without a kick drum the nervous loops trace a seemingly improvised path through a cold and dank imaginary space it drifts unpredictably from an anxious opening section through an unexpected tempo change ten minutes in and onto a subtly epic finale of arpeggios the other two tracks are more straightforward but have a similar kind of muted drama is a dub techno murmur with occasional licks of color namely bright chord changes that cut through the murk like sunlight in a dusty room does something similar but with a syncopated kick beneath its shuddering chords like the other two its dark dirty and elegantly subdued
following the dark and twisted set of remixes for alter ego klang get back into action with a two tracker from who delivers some slightly more conventional sounds kompass is on the a-side and this is some nice moody techy electro business very crisp beat patterns work nicely with some analogue baselines and gritty synth patterns to create a nice moody electronic piece of work that still remains bouncy and upbeat turn it over and you have a slightly more underground cut in korn again the mood is slightly dark and evil yet deliciously funky with the main gritty sounding riff a great thing about this track though is the different turns it makes in its duration making it never sounding dull and repetitive a nice release here on klang with two very solid productions by

does the man make the city or the city make the man judging by the success of his substance night at erghain paul rose would have no problem arguing that he has left his mark on erlin y the same token rose started the offshoot after he moved to the german capital nd indeed listening to the side on this second instalment from the label it sounds like rose has been spending time searching through the back-stock racks at wax follows the same rolling driving direction as the first release on but distinguishes itself thanks to its dubbed out drums and the reflective airy chords like a cross between rachmads early 90s tons of tones project and the long-forgotten zephyr by kech onds that lead to a ponderous break down lthough also taps into a distinctly erlin-centric style it is not as rewarding: rose strips away the musical elements locks onto an effective dance floor groove and lets it pan and jack its way through a seven-minute workout while there is nothing inherently wrong with it it lacks an identity or a flair that so much of roses music boasts
refuses to hold back across its four big-room tracks which is a smart move from the new solo incarnation of david sidley parted ways with duncan murray after last years deadly ep and the birmingham producer has returned with revitalized vision an added flair for melody and enhanced theatrics helps elevate some selections beyond average tech house material; for instance kicks off the record with a funky sidewinding synth lead that splits the difference between todd terje and kompakt the minimal nature of minus remains despite sidleys various accoutrements and the tension there makes for useful dance music practices the most restraint rarely veering off a straight-ahead course marked by jittery percussion light atmospheric swells and rolling sub frequencies the only lavish moments come during its breakdowns when sidley gets almost jazzy with his psychedelic soundbank it has a lot in common with actually and not just their identical bpms: the two tracks are only separated by the intermittent bass gnarls that run through the title track and are stronger and explore different dance floor aesthetics whereas works out a consistent groove that favors details over upward movement is essentially a six-plus minute climb through ever-rising peaks doesnt break any boundaries for but it does set a sturdy premise for the next chapter
at its best deep house spans the divide between the hedonistic and the cerebral s generally falls into the latter camp being composed of a quartet of fertile vignettes which have a slightly off-kilter feel and calculated lack of polish title track might feel a little bit contrived with its jazz licks and guru sample but it still has plenty of vitality dark side dabbling of is less predictable and with its percussive shuffle and clashing low-key spoken word vocal conjures up a genuinely disorientating atmosphere both d and meanwhile are great examples of deep dance floor abstraction with a drive and purpose as well as some beautifully realised flourishes
londons metroline recordings was formed in 2005 when three techno enthusiasts decided to put their heads together create a label and release the style of music that they loved a common story but the label and its digital sister have come a long way since these humble beginnings deep unusual and often quite daring metroline has made a name for itself in a time and place where the big boys rule the charts and the safe route has been so heavily carved out the minimalistic sound of the berlin club scene gave me the basis for this sound bring my sets on a point there they dont have safety or certainty says berliner his production is fairly stripped allowing the elements to shine through which radiate plenty of soul and warmth the opener to this release breath is a strange little tune the melodies are short and the track never quite settles into a groove t sounds like its trying to do too much lacking conviction or direction the ep gets better from there though m a is sparse and operates at an unhurried place; vintage synth washes heavily filtered voices and loose toms create a dark but friendly atmosphere stabs and well-balanced repetition build a decent after-hours groove juame also features s sleepy breezy brass with beats that are delicate but tight and punchy is more upbeat; percussion heavy with claps toms and timbales playing for dominance throughout ts certainly the dj pick more than your average tech house cut for the dance floor but while tessa is an enjoyable ride while it lasts you may not fall in love the metroline 12-inches are the real weapons to hunt down
boss mark arratt says his rocha moniker was inspired by s so it makes sense that his label should re-release what ill rewster hailed the best dance tune of the 00s olivier gr goire and geoffroy dewandelers cornerstone track was released in 2008 on ewan pearson and sasses misericord label formed from a contrast of slashing strings and a weighty bass chug s soaring warmth and dramatic grandeur still sound remarkably fresh previously featured on astro labs treasure hunting compilation follows with tinkering keys and noirish synths on the flip theres a tougher remix of that beefs things up at the expense of the originals orchestral finesse despite the remix failing to bring much to the table this is still a timely reminder of at their best ahead of their forthcoming album
gabor schablitzki has made some pretty quirky music over the years in contrast thora vukk his lp from earlier this year was a pretty serious endeavour constructed with graceful synthesis and carefully gathered field recordings by most accounts producing albums can be a stressful and/or frustrating affair nd thus as often seems to be the case for the first record after sounds like an artist revelling in freedom again unashamedly hooky its one of those tracks that lodges itself into the brain upon first listen the kind that some djs will jump at the chance to play in every set the riff is catchy and euphoric while the intros and outros are synthless and mix-friendly some will love its simplicity others will hate it fter all the only thing going on besides the faintly tropical synthwork is tiny whirring syncopation is slightly similar but much more sensible schablitzkis quirkiness is expressed here via the tracks foundation; an men break-style drum loop on the top weird groans and squeaks are splattered throughout while the similarity to the -side comes from the lead synth this time however its wistful rather than ecstatic last the gorgeous pulch seems a bit out of place clocking in at just three minutes long its burial-like vocals and clinking percussion make it sound like a rejected br cke the small interludes on thora vukk
its been a year since s last release back then he was on the tip of tongues whispering bigger and better things but as befits the current laissez-faire house scene in berlin was never going to pander to hype i forget how the cliche on amount versus standard goes but it clearly applies to him theres another one about good things and waiting which is also apt house can sometimes be portrayed as the vanilla ice-cream of dance music flavours though has the ingredients of a more colourful scoop the tracks seem like four-four spectres frocked in the rags of less bespoke beats this is mostly the doing of sprightly hi-hats that only rarely streamline their usual offbeat lane and spend the rest of the time dancing to their own rhythm giddily and prominently in the mix y with all its metronome-chasing snare hits and loosely strewn samples is at his most ragamuffin but even the comparatively smarter title track and its dub are striking for how unkempt they are a brash bass arpeggio at the start quickly evaporates any notion that is going to be slick like previous productions tour de force or amiadar and when the spirited string-sounding chords join at an unexpected juncture outside the sequence of sixteen its time to revel in a house record not because it sounds nostalgic or classic but for precisely the opposite reason: its not trying to be anything this allows a free rein to rub seemingly disparate sounds and samples together once or twice they border on the busy though overall the jigsaw pieces slot comfortably as in where jungle sounds jowly bass and space-rippling pads come together to form an easy-to-get magic eye/ear lets hope its not another year before the next release
something happened to s music around 2014 fter spending a decade releasing loopy house on labels like cadenza and bass culture his sound shifted with the release of bit on his new label while the swinging drums and bouncy bass of his earlier work remained the atmospheres became more abstract he followed up in 2016 with frequency switch which took another leap forward with strong but ambiguous moods and ear-catching synthesis he also released a pair of top-notch 12-inches with etienne as eticone and launched the twig sub-label diving further into wigged grooves and electro bleep and early detroit sounds the most accomplished work of picones career completes the transformation quality of the synth programming has reached a new level take s delightful combination of tumbling then rising figures res also a pad that drifts about like an apparition but the tracks buoyant mood proves rare as the rest of the 12-inch falls deeper into paranoia and disquiet drums tend to flick and tick rather than slap and slam which helps foreground the busy details of the synth work notable exception is glimmering modular noodle twists atop the pumping drums and bass while the drifting pad from makes a welcome reappearance lifts the track as it slides skyward release also comes with a 7-inch but its tunes arent throwaways bsence is as forlorn as it sounds with yearning soft-edged chords and minor harmonies bout saves the most sprightly groove till last
after a four-year break from the format mark stewart is back with his first album since metanarrative despite being perhaps best known for a series called warehouse sessions on modern love stewart has commonly favoured the tender side of techno but as januarys ep showed the mancunians transition to seems to have sharpened his approach resulting in what might be s most moving and sophisticated work to date is full of conventional beauty; protracted strings and pads which soar pulse float or shimmer on a dub-tinged substrate dainty as these melodies are however they often feel desolate and wistful in a forgotten toy seems to pine from the corner of a derelict mansion tracks dusty piano and unsteady toms inch towards a string-laden mid-section where the despondency reaches an exquisite peak pre-released cut is similarly pensive pairing slow-rotating dub chords with a ponderous low-end its novel to hear sorrow built to mild peaks in the same way that so many producers would with euphoria or joy beatless also does well in this respect enmeshing plinking piano and fluctuating gossamer pads to form a soft affecting conclusion to the lp though these tracks all hover round 90 bpm 120 is the number that best characterises the remainder the albums opener skips gracefully along via an emphatic rhythm section and more of those ubiquitous strings its feels totally submerged but thumps forward anyway one-off arp hits and nasal bass striking through the depths and of the are more mysterious shrouding their sonorous beats with darker wisps of melody isnt formulaic by any stretch but it does feel incredibly unified; a result of stewarts deliberate-sounding compositions when new elements appear or something else shifts the change always seems merited chord progressions are more efficient than extravagant fans of fellow signing conforce will appreciate this meticulous approach it never lets up giving a rich intelligent sound which will have you returning to it over and over
was a neat addition to the apron records family as he plots a very funkineven-like course between soulful house and evil acid workouts where this years apron ep focused on the producers dark side the dark ep for unknown to unknown is friendlier though theres a hint of menace beneath its playful surfaces is the cheeriest of the lot a low-slung house number thrown together with the bootstrap glee of breakbeat hardcore slouches along nicely but doesnt really go anywhere is better sounding like a new jack swing production on a shoestring budget for the rest of the ep those evil undertones sit closer to the surface s blunted claps and airless acid burble are slowed to a sub 100 bpm head-nod which is at least 10 bpm too far and some trippy delays in the closing minute arent enough to lift the listless mood is bookended by a kitschy monologue extolling the virtues of lsd though the music seems more interested in the grimmer consequences of excess gummy rave chords come in a troubled minor key and the trudging beat mimics the lockstep of a dance floor on the wrong side of dawn
must have been a heavy work-out for everybodys favorite swedish trance-to-minimal converts: the guys dropped not only a double-album but pumped out a steady stream of first-rate 12-inches lucky for us then that the duos idea of a cool-down after so much exertion is to knock two releases out at the same time in addition to the forthcoming my teenager gang for mule electronic they offer their third self-released limited 10-inch the two unnamed tracks here roughly mirror those on their earlier snake charmer release for wagon repair: the s an uptempo tribal partier the a deeper atmospheric space-out oth are strong indications that sebastian mullaert and marcus henrikssons production muscles remain in top shape: their dense burbly organic compositions are as consuming as they are seemingly effortless the tunes seem less like theyre supposed to represent the pink elephant on the sleeve and more like theyre intended as living landscapes where he dwells like snake charmer the has a broadly ethno-tribal coloring thats in play from the spirited handclaps at the opening and that gets expanded on by the funky drum break that sneaks in from behind given the tunes nimble serpentine undulation its a bit surprising to see a heavy-foot pachyderm gracing the cover youd think a cobra or fleet-footed gazelle more indicative the vibe is brisk and groovy abar on his afternoon tour s the tracks infectious pulse grows wind in and out of all sorts of travel-tinged atmospherics including snippets of chanting shrill wood instruments and hand percussion as if theyve decided to catalog their last holiday in sound form rather than using flickr plenty of clever unexpected rhythmic shifts and light accents here insure that even at 11+ minutes the track never loses steam or slows its roll the however nearly steals the show: roves through the midnight jungle enveloped in a swelling soundcloud stripped of almost all harmonic or melodic elements and underpinned by a lone kick drum the tune is propelled solely by a swirling tidal flux of hanging bells and filtered matter are masters at bare-bones textural dynamism: here they use processed ambience to push through darkly clustered thickets towards clearings touched by distant birdsong the tune has great stealth effect: youd be forgiven for passing it by on first listen only to realize later that a state of deep repeat best yields the tunes microcosmic pleasures long with the rest of s output this year makes the case that trance the subgenre that the duo has largely steered away from is really an unfortunate misnomer: because in the end isnt most electronic music about trance-like states in some way or another its certainly in effect here the -side being well-suited for a whirling dervish party the for a blissful bedtime story
veteran justus k hncke has never been a man to stand still probably best known for his camp take on the cologne techno sound the last eighteen months have seen him straying away from his roots in schlager and disco towards darker territories concluding with his recent collaboration with dirk leyers as kontrast with the sweaty and brooding bass-heavy masterpiece stammtisch der verzweiflung on the surface appears to be a move back towards his older lighter sound albeit with a few nods to the influences du jour however a closer listen reveals layers of subversion and trickery that were absent from his earlier work the title track begins with a lone beat slow stomping and disarmingly simple the half-speed kick and monotonous two-note bassline certainly dont demand that you dance but luckily justus understands that dancefloor impact is as much about tension and release as it is about the basic groove keeping the beat running unadorned and unembellished for so long that boredom almost begins to set in just as attention is starting to waver justus pulls the rug out by dropping the bassline even deeper and ripping the track wide open with a glorious breakdown huge luminescent detroit stabs descend from the heavens casting the rhythm section in an entirely new light and what was a lumpen irritation now becomes a welcome ground for the chords swooping above this is not a track that obeys the normal rules there is no build no warning this is rather a track of stark contrasts - the mundane and the euphoric separated by a single moment of clarity if is interesting because it gives us a peak where none was expected then b-side overhead is engaging for entirely the opposite reason dangling a filtered disco hook in front of our noses justus fools us into expecting a standard disco-house track in fact this is nothing of the sort the hook is deployed again and again hinting at the resolution we crave but always denied at the last second even when he allows us some measure of release by dropping into a breakdown true satisfaction is still denied: the beat drops back in slightly too early running out of sync and catching dancers off-step mercifully justus then allows the rhythm to creep slowly back to where we expect it to be providing the only small peak in a track that runs mainly on denial the artistry exhibited in this release is undoubtedly impressive justus skillfully skips along the line between frustration and enjoyment whilst providing enough familiar elements to draw in even the most casual of dancers however these tracks will ultimately stand or fall based on the context in which they are used they are perhaps too tricksy and focused on manipulation of the crowd to truly work as isolated pieces of music used skillfully in the mix i think they will shine
res a snowballing trend for retro sounds and styles but its getting to the point that the imitations are so spot-on its almost unnerving bristol producer s debut album is a laboured 80s synth reproduction on some nearly unbelievable next level of accuracy and facsimile: think m83s saturdays youth with all the pink fog and shoegaze clouds of uncertainty brushed away so all thats left is the sharp metal drums and decisive rhythms first taste we had was on orca recordings a track that had an uncanny grasp of miami vice theatrics uplifting melodies and a strange co-optation of dubstep structures which helped find it an incredibly receptive audience in pretty much anyone who heard it wisely including comes on an all-purpose bristol label that makes a fitting home for an album that turns out to be more about rose-tinted introspection than making asses wiggle bpms range from 140 to 120 and everywhere in between with paying little mind to the dance floor linn(ish) drums clipped and gated to the boomiest of extremes litter the record in place of dubsteps usual realistic-sounding snares and kicks so if youve heard you know what to expect that said the limited but lush sonic makeup serves to underline s careful sequencing plays with the formula on tracks like a gaudy safari through fake palm trees and cardboard animals and elsewhere moves beyond into housier territory (the surprise diva vocals of ) to pleasing effect highlights a melancholic vocal from providing a human counterpoint to s histrionic percussion and shooting-star synths dime piece and dive into the albums darker dimension replacing the fairlight glint with watery chorused guitars think cocteau twins or new order in the wistful hindsight of late 90s idm (another common nostalgic touchstone) even breaks out of its own self-imposed confines with seven-minute closer a dubstep-tempo track made almost entirely of big pseudo-tribal wooden drums that eventually loosens into the albums one moment of outstretched excess while it might seem odd to laud someone as an original for essentially replicating an established sound to do it in the confines of dubstep (originally) and move it so boldly into strange territory is a daring move in itself res no shortage of producers in electronic music wearing their sunglasses at night but pulls it off better than most

i bloody love synths thick wildly lfod leads swirling evolving pads plinky fm bells drenched in reverb and delay ill have the lot well maybe not: i cant get satisfaction from hackneyed patches like the two a penny sawtooth basslines that you hear throughout the charts no sir theyve got to be fresh to be cool go listen to telephasic workshop by boards of canada and youll know what im talking about sixth and final installment in the colours series on s fledgling label is full of great synth work feature which should give you some idea; their knack for unique sounds is well perhaps not quite matched by the others but their persistent whooping unison which sits over a slow thumping breakbeat thickened up by an evolving collection of riffs is all expertly programmed and its carried on throughout the rest creates an airy limbo from what sounds like diffused bells chromatic ringing and a straight beat with other scratchy soundclips bouncing around in like s a breathy pad fills in the gaps between sharp percussion but includes a menacing monosyllabic bassline and is post apocalyptic a lone mechanoid patrolling the wastelands takes a french mash up and adds dementedly joyful claustrophopia its the least emotive thing here but perhaps the most stylistically interesting cd which ships with the vinyl includes further to these four a trio of remixes of all lose the four to the floor thump but keep s foggy pad which swirls around various rhythmic features hrdvsion tells a bleak tale of an industrial matrix like landscape echaskech evokes vector lovers with a lush hymnal and golden scene of shafts of sunlight from heaven and squelches bursting into little clusters around the edges lj kruzers mix is unsettling in the way it broods at once morose then hopeful then foreboding not only the creativity but also the emotions shine through beautifully throughout the whole record
rarely does a label exercise as much restraint as m lmos they release so seldomly that after iovanni damicos cuttin samplin housin ep went two years with no follow-up it looked as though the small-but-influential label had called it quits turns out that this lapse was more a period of fermentation late last year fett burger (or birger in this case) released on eography turning one of the labels hits inside out and bringing his deep whimsy to the catalogue in the process the arrival of uys shows that this was no aberration: the label has moved from deft formalism to pumping oddities these tracks also depart from uys recent music releases on her and fett burgers freakout cult and 1080p showed a producer confidently exploring house musics deep and sensuous aspects but here shes set on sifting through a single banging idea to see what gems show up is so far the closest thing to a tool with sparse melody and a simple-but-engulfing drum pattern with blazing snare interventions the vocal mix featuring ska-style chords and an airy voice is propulsive as well but its numerous breakdowns let considerable air out of the tires fett burger joins her as on which despite its different title is at heart another remix of this is one of the pairs more playful offerings made primarily of mechanized hand percussion and wonky sound effects s also the only cut here to feature an actual bassline one thats more funky-smelly than funky-infectious others would do well to emit such a singular odor
the length of ricardo villaloboss tracks is constantly discussed over the past four or so years it seems like hes increased the power of his lens zooming so far into an unfolding logic of semi-determined micro-gestures that larger-scale considerations like structure dont fit in the frame in the context of music history this is hardly remarkable so the jokes surrounding each new villalobos production tend to say more about dance music conservatism than anything pertinent about the music itself if his mixes of oren mbarchis didnt have a kick snare and (immaculately produced) 909 hi-hats it would be filed as a contemporary minimalist composition indeed like the structure s drum work takes a backseat to the steady blurring of acoustic and electronic sources like all of villaloboss best music if you listen closely youre presented with a network of sounds each one suggests the placement and quality of the next like youre following his thought-process in real time theres a dazzling labyrinth to shuffle down on the productions nuts and bolts are various instances of chugging palm-muted guitar this source material suits villalobos: its rhythmic and focused on harmonics and texture the original guitars and general ambience sound remarkably intact yet theyre subtly filtered stuttering and triggering other events as parameters slowly shift against each other it results in a sense of productive stasis thats constantly renewing itself half-imagined synth textures poke their heads out of the churning whorl then retreat back below where others zip and zap like robotic bees over time more ambience and chiming harmonics are introduced only to be slowly sucked back out leaving a tight intimate soundstage theres so much happening in the background of these tracks that they reward listening on headphones but the burrowing sub line occasional bursts of hi-hats and rolling groove also make them proper wig-out material on the dance floor
a man who once confessed to spending aeons replicating the sound of a ninja throwing star to form percussion the intricate beat programming on the drum bass records rupert parkes produced as during the mid 90s almost felt like ocd his tracks for metalheadz or 997s modus operandi lp on science often seemed equally impenetrable to outsiders so far removed from the rest of drum bass they werent so much singular as solipsistic this was introspective music for headphone connoisseurs rather than dance floor fodder for the drum bass scene effectively renounced with the house and techno of 000s solaris album parkes relative silence throughout most of the 00s was broken last year with the avalanche and aviator eps on his productions label this new outlook hinted at the icy electronics of fellow metalheadz veterans source direct and the dubstep techno hybrids of ; and with the release of s closer ep on s tectonic label another signpost towards this new direction was planted a sound he explores in depth on his contribution to the kicks series s selections here all point towards a man still more at home in his own cerebellum than a club ts not just the meditative tempo for while dubsteps basslines might normally be designed to physically punch on tracks like s or the boddika remix of s own the low end sounds more like repressed memories bubbling to the surface mixing seems intended to toy with your subconscious particularly when he blends in suggestive hints of his new track over the hypnotic house of and s without ever letting it fully drop and while post burial the rave requiem conceit is now as clich d as hearing my way played at a wake s unavoidably evokes raves last rites as a diva sample is dropped into an echoing pit yet while this mix is missing anything as technically awe inspiring or individual as s 90s drum bass work its also devoid of the same sense of clinical detachment replaced instead with a more human and emotional touch discernible in the plaintive vocal sample of s rself s kicks might sound like a long dark night of the soul but at least a soul is there
its hard to understand even for a football fan what has to do with stevens former coach of 1997 uef cup winners schalke 04 but well go with it anyway its not worth questioning what inspired such sublime deep house instead its best just to sit back in wonderment at the dubby chords that underline the forward chugging momentum of the tune slowly but surely unfolding ever so gracefully over eight minutes weve come to expect as much from sans his partner-in-crime manuel tur here in the title but not in the production credits whatever that means luckily he also comes to play on the b-side as well with a dubbed-up motor city drum ensemble track that drones along in its latter half like a drunken elephant and schroul which has some congas to go along with its bass lick both are the sort of tools that has come to be known for and both are solid upbeat counterparts to the moodiness of nother solid release from
remember when used to release records that did more than act as dance floor fodder either do i while carl craig was out doing shows with a classical pianist and a dub techno legend his beloved imprint has been busy pumping out 4/4 club music no big deal of course but it does seem strange to have craig so interested in pushing things forward elsewhere and then support the status quo on with this new release the label goes some way towards proving that it hasnt lost its ear for the experimental sherrard ingram brings moodymann anthony shake shakir and craig along for the ride on as he has so often done before this is no downtempo effort ala 1996s the collapse of modern culture however each track skips along at a furious pace recalling ingrams work as dj stingray what craig and the others seem to bring to the table though is elegance if aqua team was like diving into the ocean without a scuba mask is like exploring in a multi-million dollar submarine the melodies shimmer delightfully the beats are as round as a top hat dome
this is merely speculation on my part but if you were to hear that was a little wound up while recording then you could probably understand his frustrations the us producer has been pushing an agenda that mostly draws from hip-hop r b and grime as well as a love of otherworldly mysticism for years now long before a ton of post-dubstep pretenders started excavating a cappellas from aaliyah and cassie records in short one of the tropes that originally made s music unique has now become clich and its far from his fault what will always separate s music though is the way that he uses those r b samples with many current producers you feel like the vocal snippets have been shoehorned in at the last minute for the sake of it (usually during a breakdown) but s approach is far more hip-hop: either hell find a hook and base the song around it or hell treat a sampled a cappella like a guest verse (see last years bust broke where the entire track gives way for a brief appearance by faith evans) on s lead track the minimal crooked no he opts for the former bringing a line from uk singer sadie amas fallin further and further into the foreground until its completely dominant another key factor of s music is his inventive take on rhythm ( bust broke switched time signature and is nearly impossible to be mixed past the drop) it doesnt always hit the spot on for every no where the irregular bursts of 808 kicks add to the tracks brittle minimalist feel theres a by where the stop-start chamber juke can begin to jar but it keeps you on your toes is a weird experimental record by any standards almost definitely the weirdest that s released to date but its also full of soul and unfiltered expression; the sort of record that should be cherished in an age of copycats
a large portion of the tracks on s from the far future pt 2 end exactly where they started many of them dont seem to do a ton in the middle either dixon just lays out whats going to happen and then very subtly tweaks it for about as long as he thinks it needs to be tweaked albums cover art couldnt be more fitting: an enormous sphere precariously held up by a few stabilizing pieces of wood get the angle wrong and it all falls down get the angle right and its a sight to behold more often than not on from the far future pt 2 dixon gets it right is disorienting fast-paced techno its main loop coloured every so often by what sounds like rising pink noise ne holds all of the melody underneath a heavy kick dixon inviting you inside his soundworld to find it of meanwhile puts the glittering synths proudly to the fore if this werent resolutely minimal youd expect dixon to take it somewhere euphoric but instead he just holds you there daring you to look away one of the reasons that you dont is that dixon seems to favour remarkably soft kick drums its easy to listen to him skipping across the surface of tracks like and thats not to say that he doesnt put the hammer down every so often ( bangs just fine ) but even when he does the stuff swirling around it seems to indicate that he could never fully commit to dance floor functionality by starts out ready to do so but the kick disappears in the second minute swallowed up by a synth that echoes the main melody it tries a few more times to come back but dixon pulls it in and out almost randomly as peter van hoesen recently put it in an interview with ra [ ] is just totally his own man isnt he he doesnt take any of the usual formatting into account those two sentences pretty much nail what makes dixon so interesting to those in the house and techno world when you expect the tracks on from the far future pt 2 to zig they zag its as though dixon either hasnt seen a dance floor in a while or hes simply creating dance music without caring about what works either way it makes for a fascinating listen
since debuting in 2007 as a vocalist on andy butlers first hercules love affair single has aligned herself with a certain kind of pop-friendly house music her style as a solo artist is often vocal-centric but not necessarily song-oriented with room for her light confident voice whether as a hook or a full-on verse this suits her simple productions which have largely conjured a classic milieu of dancers voguing along with back-to-basics chicago sounds but her rising profile as a dj and her collaborations with artists like maya and heidi have put foxman in another space one that has more to do with booming festival stages than smoky warehouses this is what her new ep s caters to the techy house loops and perfunctory fx comprising these four tracks do little to complement foxmans strengths as a vocalist and producer s a dud of a big room tune is so enamored with its brooding tension that it never allows the feeling to build or dissipate goes for a more playful tone in her remix but she doesnt treat her one idea any less preciously ) on what starts out sounding like a return to the jacking energy of last years open the house slips into tedium well before its seven minutes pass armed with a 120 bpm breakbeat some tender pads and a fluctuating acid sequence is by far the most sonically interesting part of this ep and a decent dj tool echoing the charismatic steal my secrets from 2014 stings as a reminder of what foxman has long been capable of
leading latest run of monad releases is aka berlin-based producer mike jefford over the past couple years hes become known for a subtly menacing style of low-tempo techno released through our circula sound and marks the first time hes released away from sighas label resulting four-tracker is mostly business as usual though the first two cuts fit particularly well in the sa aesthetic is streamlined for the dance floor with tight syncopated percussion an angular synth riff and plenty of reverb dubby finds jefford maneuvering into deeper otherworldly spaces which is where he thrives proven here by low-slung broken beats mesmerizing mechanical whispers and squiggly trebles a booming drum workout layers together hard-edged percussion as it weaves in and out of focus but the results are overly utilitarian a rare ambient track (and a nice one at that) drifts through downcast drones bringing to a hazy introspective conclusion
jay haze had by all accounts a fine 2006 his project capped off a successful move from the u s to erlin and certainly caught the attention of moody techno fans weve all heard a superlative or ten thrown his way dark side of the pony pt 2 is s first release of -side wow this is really raw sounding wait a sec am i actually trippin out in a dark detroit basement or what its a fun tune littered with thrusting 90s acid and sure to satisfy dancers who get off on detroit-style synths in some ways the song is a tease there are points where a build leads to little and youre left thinking those claps could have kicked in at a different time than they did it might not go anywhere in particular but it does create a mood -side is a bit like s younger and more doped-up brother orn of the same darkness and unmistakable old-school acid the cut moves forward around an identifiable twisting riff that never lets go there s also a spoken word vocal attesting to the importance of groove and the unifying power of underground music but it s not exactly authoritative must be that little brother thing in dark side of the pony pt 2 have created a decidedly average record: good underground fun but not especially memorable

probably the most devastating record ive ever owned back when i was djing breaks (yeah so what ) was a tune called my house by phil kieran i always thought of him as a guy who consistently nailed a number of different genres with obsidian killers and in 2007 was caned by a-listers such as vath hawtin and deadmau5 despite remix demand for the tune an apparent lack of a label for distribution resulted in the project being shelved until the recent creation of phil kieran records the happy ending is this package with a no-brainer selection of remixers turning out dark intense and massive interpretations the stockholm techno fraternity is represented with a track that plods more than storms but brews evilly with wheezing and circuit buzz stuttering throughout as clouds of smoke echo portentously chilean ricardo with releases on border community and traum turns out the only non-richter scale offering an ambient lumbering and benign mass of deflating synths and a floppy kick that doesnt quite make it to every eighth beat paul rose has two remixes here and the scuba mix is my personal favourite with a monumental catastrophic drop into pure urgency near the beginning with skittering hi-hats upping the motion a level over a sparse dubstep skank the escalating alarm of a riff that rises and descends throughout is central to a track that oozes club destruction the scb edit is also great; cool dark and completely collected but completely powerful techy rolling of the drums is joined by a brooding creature of an analogue bass riff clacking its chains more and more furiously green s is the most similar to the nasty original but straightens out the structure into an alter ego-style electro smasher adding drops that make for lots of tension for proponents of a range of different styles this slab is a serious and deadly weapon
brian jeffries is practically a detroit institution and not just in underground circles the ghetto-tech pioneer is best known for helping the genre spread outside of his hometown in the late 90s thanks to a prolific streak of singles released through his own labels these days jeffries is an internationally celebrated dj who plays everything from st patricks day parades to the detroit tigers opening day to club nights jeffries has long been a stylistic shapeshifter touching on old-school electro trap techno electro house and beyond this is detroit is said to take him back to his roots in that sense the ep succeeds its two vocal-led tunes ( no and ) are as hyped-up and bottom-heavy as anything from ghettotechs heyday with detroit mcs and waxing big dumb and nasty in turns the beats smack especially hard too lets blends those high tempos with a classic techno approach: its simple arrangement of quick-fire synth stabs and a steady beats gives the record its most specifically detroit-sounding production has done some personal and cultural archaeology for this is detroit and what he digs up is amusing if not slightly pass she in the club with her girls at the bar / big booty bitches looking like a buncha stars raps in a better title might have been this was detroit
fter the cryptic teaser of the duo on the swing set the press release manifesto now a 13-minute video to accompany its release you might forget there was actual music behind the knifes reappearance but thats olof karin dreijer for you the brother/sister duos material as the knife has always been loosely tethered to the their political stick-poking especially when it comes to notions of gender roles these concerns have never been as intricately threaded through s work as they are on their first proper album in seven years theres an ideological fury at work across the records hour- -40-minute runtime; karins voice in working through these ideas is often so distorted rogynous that she sounds like some fleshless entity howling her abuse into a gale ( lets talk about gender baby/lets talk about you me ) underneath lies an almost unnavigable network of references political commentary one moment theyre condemning egregious environmental practices like fracking the next theyre making a nod to margaret twoods post-apocalyptic novel this overt politicizing isnt the only thing thats new here gone for the most part is the frosty electronic base of their past shaking is far thornier more organic full of industrial blurts stormy drum noise passages (ala olofs work as i yhun) extended drone sequences fans seeking another marble house are offered only two throwbacks: the gorgeous vocal hook that emerges from the frothy murk of the rippling electronic pulse of instead across its expansive breadth one hears echoes of mon duuls epic krautrock jams the fried-brain electronics of einst rzende neubauten the urban tribalism of gang gang dance but even in these moments of kinship theres something so singular unidentifiable that sounds very much like something that only could pull off ginning with the two lead singles the tumble-drumming of n the muscular charge of open in fully martial mode before retreating into the warbling drones that open is an intricately constructed stomp rounded out by what sound like elfish flutes while r rms round is bleak rotten a black mass of sorts that sits atop ritualized drumming synth sounds that squeal more than they drift surrounding these aural barrages are passages more similar to what have done since silent shout which acts as a twilight coda to the albums first disc is 19 minutes of dour slowly mutating drone that wouldnt have been out of place on morrow in a year their 2010 opera about charles darwin the same can be said for the vocal-sharded droning of is a spastic garbled bit of pseudotechno that closely aligns with some of the i yhun material within the albums expanse these are moments that alternately seethe soothe testing prodding both the listeners expectations his or her patience they also massage the albums plentiful organic charges into a sonic puzzle with an almost symphonic reach one thats as challenging bounteous ultimately unknowable as anything youll hear this year

re lying around someone s house at 8 a m frontal lobes saturated and then rinsed clean muscles turned to jelly people roll on the floor smoking cigarettes slowly dropping ash on the floor and the curtains are drawn to keep out the clarity of daylight r senses are so finely attuned that you can t bear the slightest bit of harshness and you must have everything you need right now if only you could work out what you needed one thing you do know is that you need music that s soft and enfolding and that brings out the beauty in a moment that could otherwise be squalid that s what is aiming at soft beats roll along while string-like sounds soar the tempo is languid and you can close your eyes and taste the remnants of euphoria left over from a few hours before dear sings slowly metronomically and repetitively the words about cynicism loss and excess seem poignant n the cold light of day the words are doggerel somewhat pretentious and over-the-top but is that really the point n messy rooms across europe this will still hit the spot at that key moment dear is one of the great talents we ve got in electronic music right now and he does prove that he can do more than churn out bangers here lyrics are clearly not his strong suit but that probably doesn t matter in the end because with a bit of practice he ll improve (or get someone else to write them) can t wait for the album to drop kieran hebden s mix is harsher and beatier despite taking the simple melodies of the original and turning them into an overload of tinkly sweetness for one won t be listening to it after get home from sonar because of that lack of pillowy comfort t is however still beautiful and places less emphasis on the lyrics which is a good thing so although it might not be right for the living room itll still sound great on the beach especially the unexpected eight bars of kickdrum at the end
while dubstep producers have been finding common cause with up-tempo house of late ob hamra as has been finding ways to apply deep house aesthetics to a dubstep template his debut single what it is was a backward-looking masterpiece of scene-spanning ingenuity what you might imagine someone taking an underground quality record and building a syncopated rhythm at 140 beats per minute hamra is far from a dubstep purist; an unreleased vip remix sees a floaty rework of what it is at a more house-friendly tempo (which provided an answer to the titular question: house music ) more recently his seoul power mix has him combining classic house with his own tracks shedding a good amount of light on where his slightly dusty sound comes from and revealing ritish bass musics unexpected rapport with names like nton zap and kerri chandler takes what it is one step further and constructs a dubstep tune out of vintage trax records rather than uq this one is a halfstep monster that culminates in distinctly liquid crashes oversized raindrops that wobble and shatter on impact coupled with shimmering chord stabs and an ever-present electrical hum it balances dubstep deep house and even dub techno in a sonic palette that sounds right out of the early 90s capitalizing on these dub-techno hints quantec jumps in for a midtempo remix turning the shimmer into smooth lockstep-linear opacity t 127 pm its not exactly slow house but it feels like its stuck in some purgatorial stasis
when in 2013 grime producers went to war wielding instrumental diss tracks miles ell called for a ceasefire with his peace dubs instead of aggressive macho drops the boxed resident took classics like eskimo and spartan and slowed them down emphasizing latent elegiac qualities in the tracks an idea he further explored on his solo lp parallel memories now with the launch of a dedicated gobstopper sublabel ell is passing his olive branch to other producers heres a connection to be made between these edits and the weightless grime peddled by logos and mumdance but the core of is uplifting melody ells edit of hills how deep is your love makes an auspicious start layering the r b groups acapella to make them sound like a church choir when the chorus vocal and roaring bassline hit halfway through the effect is almost transcendent an achievement when you consider that the track is made almost entirely from vocal samples s which has a similar sense of poise is a highlight something like a tranquilized trap cover of deejays better off alone the australian producer takes one of eurodances post popular hits and makes it sound wounded and doleful and emphasizes how brilliant the original melody is s pairs beautiful synth tones with a glitchy vocal manipulation of running up hat hill which sounds like some waning transmission from the afterlife its an effect underlined by harsher hum-and-buzz and an eno-esque climax finish things off with a take on -pains im sprung that focuses on the originals pretty harp plucks its the least creative of the four but its no less seductive heres a bewildering quality to these tunes that goes beyond the scope of most dance edits whether you chalk that up to the talented artists or the great concept is one of the strongest things to come out of the boxed instrumental grime axis yet
richard barratts third single for dfa following one new release and one reissue is actually two reworkings of one track that he originally self-released in 2012 and of these three records sounds the closest to his previous work as half of sweet exorcist his sheffield bleep duo with cabaret voltaires richard h kirk and the artists behind the first record in warps catalog both the groove and build versions of this single are dance floor ready the former has a steady pumping beat and foregrounds the fat bassline for a slightly lower-pitched take on ravey bleep dynamics the latter a housier variation emphasizes the vocal with plenty of reverb punctuated by handclap snares and hi-hats vocalist pete simpson emotes believably enough but his somewhat flat tenor sounds a touch dated evoking an era at odds with the production quality and while both tracks are well-made and driving enough to function as intended the differences between them would probably only be noticed by devoted fans it doesnt seem that a newish project by an aging niche artist merits that kind of discernment yet

munich label great stuff give the chance to compliment his weekly aquaholic residency at privilege ibiza with a mix cd branded after the night acquaviva is an old hand: he founded plus 8 with richie hawtin in 1989 sowing the seeds for a dj and production career spanning many years not to mention an influential role in developing final scratch and beatport com last year the canadian had a prolific year production-wise teaming up with tobias lutzenkirchen and ramon zenker to send clubbers in particular the germans and italians crazy with their credit cards on the download sites but enough of the history lesson - i was curious to hear this mix subtitled the true electro experience to see where its at for aquaviva these days lets not beat about the bush here this cd is a big night out crammed into 75 minutes mike mondays dub of whirlpool productions disco to disco is a rapid-rinse intro before acquaviva himself pops up on the tracklist shifting from disco to house with the click of a mouse on no fear and feeback - two big club smashes which have appeared ad nauseam on recent setlists from sharam (deep dish) to coxy to romboy eyerer and chopstick s electric is pretty much more of the same - aquaholics might drink this up but will it tempt non-believers fairly obvious stuff i would have thought but then acquaviva has set his stall out here and theres no room for slow-builders or abstract rambles still some dodgy moments from oliver huntemann and jon kennedy draw cringes with tasha s vocal on sermon of jack grating in particular and if you thought you hadnt heard that wobbly synth from mason enough already this year well then look no further even umek seems to be on the electro bandwagon here (as if theres any more room left what with half of europe in tow) and by the time we get to d-nox and groove dust to finish the terms big-room flogging and dead horse come to mind a lot has changed since the heady times circa acquaviva and hawtins x-mix this straight-up club mix suggests john isnt interested in exploring new turf the sound of privilege isnt a huge leap from his back to basics effort in 2004 this is club music for havin it large as they say or for getting it on in your car as xenia intimates in her slightly bored voice - maybe she too lost interest and fell asleep at some point
his laid-back deep house style its tempting to characterize johannes paluka as a german jimpster his productions are often a little more skewed than the british stalwart but theres the same presence and soulful sheen his return as iron curtis to scene of one his early triumphs 2010s stansfield ep provides further proof across its duration the emotive factor on is turned up to 11 whether its the beefy piano chords searing synths or ornate bassline in contrast delivers a more splintered take on deep house its muted soul vocal and offbeat handclaps preventing it from heading to too lush a pasture an approach maintained by despite the pillowy synths that envelope it its the eps toughest most pared down track knocked off its stride by spasmodic squelches and space invader pulses paluka then flips the script on lasgas its lurching broken-beat ending up as a melancholic riff on 90s neo soul its tantalising glimpse of what iron curtis could do if he stepped away from four-to-the-floor more often
new week a new label a familiar proposition: in an age of endless releases and labels aims to release beautiful special records that will last in the hearts of the public ( s james murphy might respond want to make something real want to make a yaz record ) ut irishmen-in- erlin mano le tough and the are nevertheless off to a strong start with the inaugural release on their new label newcomer proves worthy of his namesake a lake in siberia the deepest in the world on and its plenty deep with luscious synth chords and a spine-tingling high-end but unlike so much full-fathom house music these days its sonics dont sound like a copy of a copy of a copy its warm and chilly all at once both welcoming and a little alien; the s processed vocals stake down the center while shimmering synth riffs peel off and fly away drifting into the shadows in slow motion like the specks off a disco ball dont ya stakes out similar terrain with crispy jangling percussion and dusky thuds laying the groundwork for a slow swell of harps arpeggios and mournful voices; theres a hint of monochrome acid in there somewhere and below that a self-effacing bassline its not a flashy track but it leaves an impression

is one label that has continually done the business over the last year or two from the very massive ride the label can showcase their ability to deliver variation as they do here with this release by called hailing from hungary this trio once again showcase the heavy amount of talent coming out of europe deep chunky house is what s on order here and if it s good enough for sander kleinenberg in his recent renaissance mix then it is sure to be good enough for many more willing souls the original mix is where the hard work is done for me very very chunky to say the least the baseline oozes its way through the speakers in very sexy fashion a good reason why it was a highlight on the aforementioned mix release by sander cheeky little vocal samples don t harm the production either making this a tight little production shootie s pumpa mix on the flip isn t too bad either delivering yet another solid baseline to the package the beats are very crisp and layered very tribally creating quite a percussive production as the low end sounds chug along under the beats small hints of melodic tones sneak their way in eventually helping the production greatly creating in the end a pretty solid remix that doesn t harm the release but rather helps it along quite nicely consistently good is at the moment and long may this live check this out at all costs fro some solid house grooves
are remarkably prolific drum bass artists whose releases are so consistent that their eps tend to blur together theyve released on countless labels but their signing to is their most important in a while because it positions them as part of a growing label empire one currently behind some of the most vibrant music at 170 pm recognizing shoguns pop leanings the two tracks on feature s angelic vocals (the latest in a long line of collaborations between the singer and the duo) the title tune really puts s talents in plain sight: elegant vocal aside the way the piano stabs clamp down on the bassline is nothing short of pop perfection she also shows up on where the duo craft a slower number in the vein of lix that feels like its floating on clouds funnily enough lix remixes paranoid into a standard club track but the synths that roll back and forth bear his distinct touch s two instrumental tracks fare very differently is a frenetic banger that balances on seesaw synths; its a track the duo could have made in their sleep ut shows what sound like when theyre really trying everything is blown up to hollywood proportions with drums that hit like thunderclaps big emotive strings and synths that sound three-dimensional

john barera and ariana paoletti (aka volvox) run a party at brooklyns bossa nova civic club called from the two eps theyve released since the summer including this one s you get a sense of what the residents might play for anyone not familiar with the party reads a memo the mission of the label is straightforward: techno acid and a hint of electro that more or less describes this record a quartet of neatly groomed drum tracks draped in black leather its smooth contours would be a joy to mix with straggly ebm tracks but the overall scope seems too narrow especially when compared with s two recent releases for l i e s which were more willing to mess around even when lacks s usual sense of adventure the twists and turns of his acid leads keep the pot boiling the title tracks contorting 303 with its plus 8-style spaciousness has a satisfying scrunch hits another sweet spot smothering busy one-shots and a frosty melody in cosy static the other tracks are less enticing the synth loop on is pretty anonymous and while gated vocals give some urgency the melody is less rousing with the exception of presents the same idea in slightly different ways is by some distance the best of the three
theres a moment during s 16-minute opening track when everything falls into place the kick drums are galloping tastefully the chords are majestic and little details dot the background like a star chart its breathtaking dub techno made without the usual clich s which helps explain why has such a devoted following despite his relatively small discography is gerard hansons second album as following a self-titled lp from 2006 and only his second record under the name in nine years earlier this year acido 22 featured two lengthy tunes that stripped hansons music down to a beatless core it was a compelling ep that showed the strength and universality of hansons songwriting: take away the drums and his music still hits all the right places brings that same soul and passion back to the dance floor keeping the emotion intact the 16-minute might be the most arresting track in the catalogue it highlights his unique gift for programming a hypnotic synth loop repeats for the songs duration but it gurgles like a creek rather than something made with machines hanson writes electronic music with an unusually gentle touch the kick drums feel comforting the slow chord progressions dusky and illusory s other tracks are around seven and eight minutes each and find hanson borrowing the sound palette of peak-period metroplex he puts together smooth drum programming and zig-zagging synth lines as thick as anchor line he leaves plenty of room for each element to make its mark and builds the songs with an artisans attentiveness the basslines in are malleable and warped as if melting in hansons hands in the funkier the percussion is essentially perfect so well-built that you could imagine it took years to perfect this music is so painstakingly fine-tuned that it actually sounds effortless hanson has a slow-drip catalogue (a rash of electro records as e r p aside) few producers could come and go as frequently as hanson and still receive so much attention and respect maybe thats because few producers make music as refined as his its the reason why s 2006 self-titled album still earns him new fans sounding as fresh and mysterious today as it always has this record seems destined for the same fate as recognizable and likable as the vintage sci-fi artwork that adorns it feels timeless

the result of a collaboration between patrick chardronnet and berlin trio frilounge was given its first airing on steve bugs poker flat volume 4 back in 2005 and now finally has warranted a full release with remixes from lush techno overlord gabriel nanda and gender-confusing minimalist sarah the original is all squelchy thuds and bubbling acid hooks which while pleasant enough seem lacking in depth the bassline is warm enough but the ringing pad that joins the ensemble a few minutes in is relatively lightweight and does little to round the track off however if you think warmth is a quality best reserved for slippers and are partial to the odd bit of repetitive finger-wagging on the dancefloor itll probably float your proverbial boat just fine nanda makes the bass the leading light of his performance and adds twisted vocal croaks as well as a chant reminiscent of djum djums tribal rants on leftfields genre-smelting fro-left its darker and more serious than his recent coconut blues but still retains a sense of humour with effects that would be more at home on the audio rack of a disney sound engineer than one of the worlds most established forces of techno marseille-based jean-vincent luccini pinched his female pseudonym from the widowed mother in requiem for a dream and judging from this effort it seems the producer has taken inspiration from his namesakes catatonic state the track does very little but delivers what it does do exceptionally well straddling dub techno minimal and tech house effortlessly

might have been the dancer when todd l urns so neatly defined each of the underground quality-affiliated artists last year ut if were continuing to put them in little boxes the new jersey-based producer surely must be termed the weird one while fred p and levon vincents production work seem to have obvious antecedents qu puts such a unique stamp on his tunes that its hard not to wonder where hes getting his inspiration is a case in point showcasing qus just off enough to make you look twice house music on both sides gets -side honors with qu narrating an erotic tale that seems creepy when placed alongside his out-of-tune piano plinking and crawling drone of a melody put someone saying i want to feel your desire on a jacking house beat no problem make it sound like the master copy has purposefully been soaking in a plastic bag in your toilets cistern on the flip dispenses with the subtleties and gets down to the grimy business of moving the floor in the hands of a lesser producer setting out this groove would be enough ut qu throws in malfunctioning snares a quick riff that says hello every half-minute or so and also finds time to warp the groove to ensure youre never quite sure where hes going fun to dance to as qu can likely show you ut also weird to listen to in other words top stuff
all too often we come across dance acts who have a couple of massive singles successes but are unable to translate these into a decent album this being the case i approached the little gingers album with some caution happily it proves something of a success mr deluxe has clearly mastered the art of an infectious pop-dance song as in the massive it just wont do from last year or the arguably more superior less talk more action terra deva on fantastic vocal form however he does try too hard to present a variety of styles with the result that what a life (amsterdam) comes over as a misguided attempt to do a rap track 2 kool 4 skool sounds derivative as well with more than a passing similarity to oskar gs dark beat in its tribal chorus back to the plusses though for ben onono introspective vocal on battle is perfectly done over an atmospheric filtered house backing as is choose something like a star with the same vocalist once the chat dies down on record shop theres some good sax led house - kind of like lily was here in a pete heller style handsomely packaged is a good debut album but arrives with the feeling that its author should concentrate on what he does best
last month the swedish techno artist made an announcement to his facebook followers in less than a month i will wake up to my 10 000th day of life he said to honor these vital days the days that have shaped what i am what i do and will do in the future i want to create a testament to mold my inner self in sounds without any compromise that testament is an open-ended release to which new tracks will be added incrementally during the coming 832 days all of them available for free on bandcamp even if s cosmic goth vibe is a bit much for you is well worth a spin paula temple said she was floored when she heard the first track and its easy to see why: this is fierce artistic techno that sounds like little else out there that one and baal share an arresting quality: they literally sound like machines what youre hearing doesnt sound like an arrangement of loops its like a field recording of some hulking mass of gears and valves gurgling away at what just happens to be 130 bpm a collaboration with the artist has the same odd effect thudding to a groove as irregular as it is intuitive like the rhythm of waves against a ship all three are lovingly crafted pieces of music not the kind of throwaways you might expect from a free release if theyre any indication of whats to come it will be a pleasure to catch s sonic castings as they bubble up
m n d y and ooka shade first released their version of laurie ndersons electronic classic as part of 07s five years get physical compilation despite cottoning on to a good idea the first remix was definitely a water-from-wine sort of affair whereas ndersons original is a delicate personal multi-faceted piece of music that grows softly and steadily to a lush and gorgeous crescendo the two duos version is notable only for managing to fill six minutes with no emotional content whatsoever (the loving gentleness of nderson was instead replaced by bouncy house that did nothing and said nothing with a snippet of ndersons original vocal slathered on top ) unbowed get physical have commissioned another six acts to pummel nderson leading off the first ep matt turns in his least interesting track for some time nd possibly ever this is a far cry from the holographic music that has been the goal towards which many of his recent productions have aimed rather his take is a confusion of instincts which blend both melodic complexity and big room earnestness instead of releasing a matt record on get physical has tried to adapt his style to the get physical aesthetic and the result is ungainly before even considering the fate of the original material caught in the crossfire the original (i e the m n d y and ooka shade version) comes second and true to its name is identical to the one on the gp comp discussed above closing out the release is the 14-minute reboot effort there is an organic feel ushered in by fleet percussion including plenty of handclaps eventually backed up by a growling bassline in short this track would feel right at home on reboots frequent home cadenza the frankfurt-based producer has the courage to sample ndersons vocal much more extensively meaning the remix is rich and adventurous at least and the climax has a hint of lushness whether or not your tastes run in the same direction as cadenza at the moment will determine whether you like it but reboot has at least shown sympathy for the source material rather than hatred n the second ep the always discrete udiofly start things off quietly with a fairly sensitive track that eeks from its rollicking polished electro house surfaces something of the trance-esque subtlety which works well at least until the peal of bells that announces the beginning of the end after five minutes and which make me think of quasimodo rather than beautiful church music tragic hero felix steps up next and proves yet again that he is now more like a bloated old alley cat that lives behind a dumpster his mix is cheesy strings la tiesto over an incongruous jacking beat if m n d y s version is water-from-wine felixs is closer to sewage-from-champagne robag wruhmes is the closing contribution he gives us six minutes of indifferent glitchy minimal with a few random smooth jazz piano chords at the end if all this seems a bit harsh i will confess that i am an out-and-out laurie nderson partisan; all of these guys meddling with her music was probably never going to elicit much more than jealous bitterness from me call that full disclosure still we all know that get physical are capable of great things and this isnt one of them
jungle has long been a staple of s diet but lately its been the only food on the plate last years the serpent and the rainbow was the closest hes come to direct revivalism and was one of his best this lengthy ep for lapsus keeps the nimble breakbeats dubby basslines and creeping paranoia of the style but returns to the bass music-compatible tempos of earlier releases in the past this combination has worked well for the keysound affiliate but the loss of a few dozen bpm here is sometimes painfully felt mainly this is down to the structures (a bit long-winded) and the arrangements (on the simple side) the first and last tracks struggle the most their painstakingly chopped breakbeats sound smeared and listless and the atmospheric material (soulful chords feather-light strings) lacks the drama needed to make the whole thing zing at seven and eight minutes respectively both tracks run out of new things to say well before theyre over elsewhere the tracks get more concise and a little more imaginative on turns that listless mood to his favour time-stretching vocal samples until they sound like despondent aliens slouching through a downpour of hi-hats is the eps funkiest moment its sleek half-time groove punctuated by the requisite pulpy film quote (its from videodrome ) on cranks the tempo up to 160 sending his drums pirouetting between half- and double-time patterns here finally he captures jungles spirit as well as its constituent sounds

is an 11-track album by dallas texas producer and its also an abridged ep both of mwanza wanz dovers new records were released by sheffield label but only the condensed version made it onto this limited-edition vinyl se four tracks are album highlights dover works with a chilly but rich electro sound thats as classic as its sharply produced low-end frequencies slip in and out of so slyly that you cant be sure you even heard them and splits the difference between vangelis and aux 88 powerful contrasts of skeletal backbeats and rigid robo bass against lush melodic pads is once again reinvigorated on this ep seems less like a teaser for the full-length than an invitation for djs to take s tunes to the club with its broken grooves and rampant atonality might be a bit too disjointed for the dance floor ( masque from the lp wouldve been a stronger choice) but its not hard to imagine the majestic funk of arctic captivating any room that its vast starry-eyed synths envelop without question though will do the most damage sounding like gesloten cirkel paying homage to kraftwerk dover seamlessly merges the mystery and ferocity of electro into his own immersive sound world

the insert written by dj dribbler in reissue of pierres pfantasy club is quick to point out the rise in popularity of retro culture over the last decade on the surface the label has fought against this pushing new artists and sounds over the course of its short history look deeper though and the founders also have a healthy reverence for the past (jackmaster spencers recent detroit special on rinse fm being a solid case in point ) so its not much of a surprise in a way to see the sliced up wailing vocals dramatic synth orchestra stabs and fake slap bass that make up this bit of acid house appear on it might be trendy to name check the genre as an influence but for many new jacks theyve never heard it like this some of these elements will still find their way into modern music but rarely in this way whats more the song has a structure that follows traditional pop music with chorus verse and bridge parts to boot seiji appears on the -side and with no original parts to work from does a faithful flip he simply strips back some of the wilder more camp moments and adds a tougher more growling bassline this record represents wildly fruitful times for electronic dance music both then and now the domination of the pop charts by artists who engaged cutting edge sounds and techniques for their output in the 80s is similar to the current fascination and rise in popularity of unlikely stars were seeing generally in electronica today and ought to be congratulated for recognising this
until now ussie label have been best-known for releasing the work of signature artist dro carey the complex tirelessly fascinating and experimental sydneysider in comparison is a more instantly welcoming artist at least when it comes creating music for the (dark) dance floor rides in on a spectral cloud of urial-style womb-like vocals before settling down to a convulsive buzz-saw synth melody slo-mo ukg rhythm and tremulous low-register bassline thigpens reworking is a beautiful near-beatless slice of urban techno pulses of muted breathy keys inhale and exhale as a raw bass kick taps out a quivering distant refrain; shed you expect would approve that have moved to a vinyl-only policy should ensure a bit of good ol fashioned scrabbling around to secure a copy
the impeccable label that gave the world rustie and his long since sold out jagz the smack ep have been quietly whittling away in the back room of the rubadub record shop in glasgow for a while now this the labels sixth vinyl release is the techno-infused work of one ruaridh law (also known as one-third of the marcia blaine school girls) under his alias after a low key release on the equally iconic highpoint lowlife label its laws turn to handle both sides of the platter on is the centerpiece of the a-side and its a telling nod to a non-genre specific world where the ambient chimes of eno can sit comfortably with the pounding thump of a 4x4 kick drum and the chaotic percussion of early squarepusher bonus beat streamlines its predecessor into a delayed glitch-led stomp that sirens its way around the pistoning kick drums and the snatches of rave-era drum breaks 2562 pops up for a refix of and the dutchmen manages to effortlessly stamp his gloopy atmospheric trademarks all over the track stuttering 140 bpm drum patterns so they gallop into the reverb soaked snare clicks while simultaneously encasing everything in the polar warmth of his sprawling chord stabs despite this impeccable guest spot law still manages to steal the show with the b-side relying more on sculpting his synthesizers to pipe up and down at what seem like random integers rather than resting on the sheer power and pace of the thumping kick drum he creates a mood-soaked piece that carries off the low end bumps with the unrelenting prevalence of an aging drunk with a pint glass full of magners and a neck full of viagra

mario weises project a mainstay of leipzigs moon harbour recordings was mining deepness european-style long before it was cool and one suspects hell be sticking with it long after its moment passes plenty of rhodes-bearing crackly-record-sampling producers owe a whole lot to his sound whether they know it or not but as deep house gained more acolytes its sound palate expanded accordingly an outlet for folks like andr lodemann and andreas saag is representative of that expansion which makes a new ep from on the label an exciting prospect but though it may be ripe with ideas the ep doesnt always feel like its full of the freshest ones after a quick statement of purpose saunters in though it boasts some very good production it ends up feeling a bit like a pressure-washed red rackem: hazed and loose in mood it nevertheless steps to a grid featuring an assist from longtime partner-in-crime comixx and up-and-comer feels much stronger: placing innervisions-ready vocals over dfa-style backup the track makes for the sort of earworm youll have a difficult time dislodging pairs subgenre staples like vamping pianos and anthemic vocals with just enough subtle detailing wandering bass curiously warped secondary melodies a distant tambourine on the backbeat to differentiate it as lovely as the track is though probably could have reeled in the eight-minute-plus runtime a hair luckily a lovely downtempo outro finds the curtain drawing on a positive note
capping an already busy year for the (be it their brilliant alearic piss-take with rune lindbaek as meanderthals or tweaking dimitris early 80s selections for their nightdubbin mix for e) comes this new 12-inch on noid side from jazz fook has there been a more apropos title than uilding with wordless hums suddenly a massive flanged drum roll swings through threatening to clear the discotheques walls of all its flowers only to drop those same folks down a black hole filled with riotous calls and a rabble-rousing speech snippet just when you think a lynching may be next a tambourines slink and slinky guitar line appear to levitate your drunken befuddled ass on up to heaven the track now suddenly infused with angelic choirs and hosannas its both heaven and hell on one side and a hot earthly mess in the most glorious sense pounds even heavier with all sorts of laser pulses italo synth stabs and hand drums squawks and squelches abound but it all hovers in that massive aural space the oys have always played about in (and more intently) though it never really goes anywhere purgatory perhaps

shame on the founders of is it alearic for adding a question mark to the end of their label name: all along i thought i knew what alearic was and now i feel flush with anxiety perhaps though the question is meant as a simple a r mantra one to be recited when listening to demos as far as y is concerned im happy to report that the dna test results have come back and theyre positive y is sunburnt sundazed caked in sand and salt water hungover drifting out to sea amnesia-ridden a starfish in its mouth the original strikes all the boxes on the alearic checklist relying heavily on atmosphere dubbed-out percussion soundtrack-y composition and evocative instrumentation what merits attention is the fineness of its execution which never allows its liberal use of psychedelic effects to drown out the melodic content the two remixes here stay in the tripped-out mood and embellish the tunes potential: taken together the three form a kind of psychedelic rock suite not unlike pink floyds echoes the shrinkwrap remix doesnt deviate heavily from the original in fact given the tunes diffuse jammy character you might get confused as to which mix is which: shrinkwraps is the drier of the two and the acid line he tosses in its midst serves to glaze the hippie jams with a more futurist veneer no worries: y could go on for an hour and you probably wouldnt notice it the choice cut is probably lovefingers remix which laces its gorgeous acoustic guitar with peyote-dance flourishes like hand percussion and aww-wooo vocals
has always had an odd relationship with functionalism and restraint her formidable minimal house tracks have never really blossomed into bangers instead steadily feeding off their own edging tension (which obviously could be just as cathartic or thrilling in its own way ) but whether you attribute it to her much-discussed classically-trained background or not the chicago producer is defined her studied subtlety more than any other trait with bits of classic house boogie poking out of her carefully built structures those chicago touchstones have made it overground on her debut the rather brief wraps a sleek organ riff around heavily manipulated percussion and a linear bassline unlike the writhing monsters that usually lurk beneath her tracks signals a move away from stuffy claustrophobia for simko a move that comes correct on early album highlights like first single one of simkos most accessible tracks all cool-blue chords or especially the latter is stunningly melodic hearkening back to the stately majesty of 2006s strumm taking all the elements of disco ropey bass horns strings falsetto vocals and meticulously re-arranging them so they fit into the albums sparse late-night feel unfortunately simko isnt able to repeat that particular trick for the entire lp the further down the spiral she tries to go with her new reductionist spirit the more she ends up wallowing in the kind of mnml lassitude that her previous work so narrowly avoided the stodgy hints at this barely scraping with its springy pronsato-lite bristle while just fails awkwardly foisting a simplistic drum track onto dissonant see-sawing thats not to say she cant find a happy medium: the percussion-heavy manages to pound itself out of the near-fatal arrhythmia like a spruced up m_nus jam but when compared to something like even these tracks feel frustratingly incomplete the album closes in promising fashion with arguably the perfect marriage of her minimal past and her new explicitly chicago direction as finger snaps elegant drums and soft vocals swirl and churn in a closed-circuit push-pull flurry s an anti-climactic end to an up-and-down album one that seems to hint as much at diminishing returns as it does unbridled potential im tempted to just say pick a side because as proves being split down the middle isnt the best look for simko
chiptune music seems destined to be a niche a branch of music reserved for a certain kind of lovable basement-dwelling nerd incorporating these tinny synths however has become something of a movement in dance music appropriated by names as wide ranging as ikonika flying lotus and zomby l a s does not make chiptune music though is too scattered to be any one thing for more than a few moments rather his stomping and cartoonish beats are perfectly aligned with the choppy hip-hop of his los angeles contemporaries hurried collages indebted to prefuse 7 and daedelus despite all this its safe to say that 8-bit sounds are the dominant element in s melting pot of styles; his tracks centre around tiny pixellated cores that thump in stop-frame motion as elaborate steel wireframes are built around each two-minute blip sometimes caging in the shrill trills and other times protruding through the result is a rather seamless compound of funk-infused hip-hop and chiptune that nimbly avoids novelty not an easy thing to do when youre dealing with music that could have at least partially come out of a nintendo circa 1985 each song is overstuffed with ideas its a 8-minute lp that feels much longer a good thing in this case wisely avoids the schizophrenic channel-skipping to which his peers are so often prone building tunes armed with an exacting focus even when it seems like brilliant ideas are defiantly tossed off the crunchy demolition of acts a sort of microcosm for the entire album as it crumbles and collects into a gorgeous decayed dust that simply blows away in seconds a tantalizingly brief outro finds time to explore other genres in these 8 minutes: is a formidable take on dubstep where bubbly gurgles of squelching bass are infected with 8-bit parasites which replicate and explode in shrieking spore clouds fellow los angeles native devonwho collaborates on another highlight star a nauseously lurching bit of dive-bombing arcade-funk that overloads the frequency spectrum with both its violently elevated levels and thick syrupy body elsewhere he approaches saturation point with nostalgia as on his refix of the is right theme (seriously) tracks like three and that tap into the seemingly endless well of chillwave-associated memory haze muzak but these experiments work so well youre more likely to nod your head than roll your eyes theres a brief glimpse of what happens when chiptune takes over as the albums identity briefly shifts halfway through heralded by a voiceover that asks what will the future bring from nintendo evidently the future holds a time warp as the thundering boom-bap is finally relegated to the background and his glorious nes is allowed to take the forefront fuzzy clouded bass and all of course it only lasts for a few moments before its diced up like everything else but it and following track (a dramatic synth odyssey that sounds like funked-out mega man music) are a window into s imagined parallel universe for now hell have to stick to ours but he might as well because no one else knows how to blend waxy chiptune with earthy funk like he can
aka brian mitchell is a seasoned jazz musician who makes techno and flashes of his musical upbringing appear on and are both led by lean catchy melodies whipped up by ticking hi-hats and solid kicks uses a string of gently distorted guitar licks which mitch ties to his drums like bunting on the whole though is more a techno ep made by a guy who just happens to like ornette coleman the music is a fun and pliable sort of techno that sometimes resembles fiedels solo work (the two released an ep together in january) but lacks a bit of colour in places that bluesy electric guitar in the title track gives mitchells beat just enough of a hue but the riff on drags without a supporting melody to hold it up does away with melody altogether and in doing so highlights mitchells firmer grasp on rhythm
lets get straight to the point udions remix of s im is probably the most hyped release of the year so far lthough a lot of this hype can be put down to the fact that the track has been around for an unfeasibly long amount of time before getting a proper release it also seems to suggest that this is a special record ut is it the answer is yes this is a brilliant piece of music though it doesnt sound quite as you might expect firstly its worth noting that this is udions first major smash that comes in the form of a remix are now a rock b so it sounds ever so slightly more like a song than some of his previous output indeed rnaud rebotinis camp vocal will raise a few eyebrows yet even though udions rework is a little more low key than the hype might have suggested with a trademark chaotic breakdown only emerging around nine minutes into the track its still a masterclass in atmosphere poise the structure is perfect with deep almost gospel style organs droning throughout a truly vivid sense of tension here udion has ripped up the original rebuilt this track as a sort of nick cave does acid house confessional the result is truly anthemic but not in the huge speaker-blowing way that udions recent work has been still when it does ignite st well back the remix works because youll find yourself thinking that the 11 minutes in which you listen to it are the most intense vital of the evening making it the perfect record with which to finish or start a set udions work here is even more miraculous when you consider the fact the original is a piece of truly desperate cock rock that sounds like what would happen if uddy holly trent reznor had a summer/moroder style sexual encounter in the recording booth its a testament to his skills that udion uses little or no elements from this original yet his remix sounds like you really wish would: lean mean dangerous sadly lumpen is a better word for the french act these days there are four other tracks on this record none of which tell us anything about post-smagghe that we didnt already know thankfully that couldnt be further from the case with udion as this remix shows off yet another trick from the repertoire of a red hot techno star
records are havens for high production values but they wouldnt be nearly as successful if bunnik didnt give his sounds so much breathing room the dystopian elements ep doesnt just feature great sounds placed artfully and sparingly in a stereo image however it also gives them four very different sorts of knots to get all tangled up in opener and though techno to the core both positively slink: despite the crispness of their drums these beats are nevertheless impervious to the sticky-tack of gorgeously weighty basslines the latter whose bouncy heft recalls peter van hoesen plays with the relatively slow tempo especially well filling in wide valleys in the beat with nets of organ swells as proves a faster clip doesnt necessarily mean a heavier vibe: breaking down and burning out before ever settling into a regular groove s beat dematerializes amidst humid half-melodies the ep does have one moment where some real honest-to-goodness techno emerges wade far enough out on and youll hit it but its merely a tantalizing whisper a quiet come-on from bunnik if ever there was one its subtle gestures like these that will likely land many new admirers here and bring all current adherents even further into the fold
in the lead up to his latest lp and dropped an ep with an original cut not included on the album bundle of remixes mulero offers two typically gritty 4/4 tracks the original mix of is suffused with shrill beeps packs in layers of rattling hi-hats cymbals a sparser smoothed-out hypnotic edit of lp cut has mulero adding a dose of reverb (plus a barely-there sample of a child speaking) dragging a low offbeat growl across the mix shxcxchcxsh dial up the tempo with their seesawing take on the albums atmospheric 90-bpm title track it pairs the originals ethereal tones with gnarled knots of drums stanislav s thunderous remix of anchored by a stuttered kick transforms dramatic chord splashes into a searing otherworldly tempest not to be overlooked though is his digital-only rework one of his slower spacier efforts (though its still a brisk 130 bpm) the shrill treble from the original is draped over a syncopated kick a few twitchy hi-hats while a subtle drone creates a vibe thats as eerie as it is forlorn

4heros dennis dego mcfarlanes relationship with verona label dates back to 2001 with the four stark bass music records he recorded for the imprint as nutmeg this release however finds him exploring jazz/soul/electronica under the name dego 2000 black family opener is the obvious standout building brightly with several minutes of jaunty bass piano and light synth effects before the appearance of a euphoric classically soulful harmonised vocal from kwasi and kaidi tatham which should see the track safely into in a multitude of record bags features a sweet and smooth vocal from broken beats guest singer of choice bembe segue gloomy bassline and percussion provide a minimal and unobtrusive framework for her voice to flourish in true smoky basement club style is the eps only instrumental and falls more on the electronic side with intertwining synth lines and drum patterns swaying gently around each other ll in all a laid-back treat
have now made two dance singles for that arent very danceable each time backed with a more floor-friendly remix obviously al usher and ewan pearson have little interest in club bangers but it s the way skews dance conventions with unusual combinations that makes the project intriguing for their debut trauermusik the polar opposites pensive funeral music vs exploding drums slow-motion minor keys vs a squiggly-funk bassline sounded particularly friendly but this time the combination equal parts krautrock and balearic vibes is not so successful sure might have an ear for a laidback and juicy melody but it also sacrifices the best part of the motorik rhythm: a taut velocity instead of sounding epic it is distinctly lacking in tension stumbling through its eleven-minute running time with its head cocked backwards usher and pearson do know how to make a hook burrow but with they ve top-loaded the track the weave of melodies in trauermusik have been replaced with a tangle in the end the strengths of don t hit quite as hard the second time around you could say it s a track that d make a great opening to an album but framed all wrong for a single (perhaps would be most comfortable as an album project ) oh and the less said about the radio slave remix the better sadly
the tempos and 4/4 beats on y rs ep inch nascent dutch imprint back towards traditional techno territory but its still as distinctive a record as youll find in the racks right now at 115 shuffling beats per minute isnt so far off from what kassem mosse is doing if a bit housier with gritty drum machines and elegiac rhodes its suffused in hiss and pushed forward by an indistinct grumble; im reminded of the sense of desolation raime conjures though here its tempered into a warmer friendlier sort of melancholy paced at a similar tempo nevertheless feels more upbeat thanks to a jacking groove and buoyant chords tumbling like a trampolinist in slow motion what might take a few listens to pick out is a strange rattle corkscrewing through the high end its a tiny detail but it makes the track tugging it ever so slightly off its axis the final track is the tour de force ten minutes long feels like two maybe three tracks mashed together it opens with a low drone a swirl of voices and a crackle suggesting boots in snow; two and a half minutes pass before the first kick drum drops making it the perfect mixtape opener ( lmost too perfect: it sets the mood so well youd feel like you were cheating ) with the 4/4 kick it grinds ahead like some fusion of sandwell district and newworldaquarium until improbably a buzzing chord progression takes the fore straight out of moodymanns playbook it thumps on like that for a while all spilled beer and needle fluff before easing out the way it came in
first tip-off that s is fantastic comes just past the halfway point of the album res a cover version of doors on the and it doesnt make you want to kill each and every one of the trio florian schirmacher henrik raabe and jakob seidenstickers take fits snugly into yet another low-key but driving tune on an album full of them res a killer on the road no problem his brain is squirming like a toad excellent take a long holiday dont mind if i do boys thanks it takes a unique group to build an album that can sustain such a potentially divisive cover song but are nothing if not unique trio runs in dance music circles previous singles have appeared on eskimo connaisseur and liebe*detail among others and yet play shows with guitar and keyboard only thing that distinguishes them from a rock band such as doors is that instead of a drummer you have one guy behind an oversized mixing board tweaking the percussion in real-time instead of playing it in listening to however even that is called into question unlike their dance music brethren s drum programming is deliciously organic its no accident that villalobos was moved to remix kings child a 2009 single on motivbank nonetheless what makes great is the trios ability to balance defining elements of rock and dance effortlessly: re are few orgiastic solos here restraint is the watchword nothing overtly memorable happens in for example but listen closely and youll hear what amounts to a jazz band hard at work making it sound like theyre anything but hard at work is the only major misstep to these ears as the trio takes on balkan music but forgets that the blasts of virtuosity are the thing that keeps the bounce of taraf de ha douks interesting by nature arent interested in such showmanship and without it the song comes off as an irritatingly long bit of musical tourism that they seamlessly find their way into the one of the albums two centerpieces along with the aforementioned is testament however to how carefully this album was constructed without would likely not work as well a point that should assuage vinyl-lovers that may already have some of these tracks in 12-inch form for those who havent been following closely may comes as a minor revelation danceable techno-not-techno played at techno speeds its not a reinvention of the wheel and there are plenty of groups emerging at the moment doing similar work such as elektro guzzi and brandt brauer frick but is likely the only one that youll find that can credibly cover doors and warrant a villalobos remix that much i reckon should make you want to hear its well worth the time
when we think of dancing we tend to think of all-out sweating jacking obliviousness but there s another type of dancing - that eyes-shut arms outstretched palms up spinning round slowly on a beach moment which is the reason balearic music exists as a genre in those moments emotion is more key than rhythm and the songs that really imprint on your memory are the ones that draw you down into a wealth of detail not necessarily the big hooks and forceful rhythms that matter in dark basements are possibly the first band since loved s heyday to directly address this niche in dance music with a whole album balearic dj s modus operandi has usually been to comb through every genre looking for those perfect beach songs (80s synth pop being particularly fertile ground) but this year possibly sparked by the general dj harvey love there have been a spate of overtly balearic disco releases with squarely at the forefront thing that i love most about this album is simply that it really does sound good outdoors so much modern music sounds really tinny and synthetic when played on a crappy boombox against the backdrop of nature in all its glory but this is considerate and organic enough to nicely complement even the most beautiful scenery sounds are soft and natural (flamenco guitar ) and swell gently ebbing and flowing se tunes are like spirals your attention is inevitably drawn deeper and deeper to the exclusion of all else sitting here in front of a mechanically flickering screen in a sterile office it makes me yearn (even more than usual) to not have a job and to spend all my time on a beach re s a laziness to the way the melodies unfold and meander that makes the daily grind seem not just unpleasant but pointless too it s worth mentioning that are a band this is not an insignificant point intricate and multi-threaded songs like these can really only be cooked up by several humans working together in harmony it s got to be a good thing for electronic music that today s technology more than ever allows people to collaborate meaningfully and break loose from the plonky structure that sequencers impose on music those of us not blessed with a round-the-year beach existence should also probably note that this is an ideal chill-out album even if the phrase chill-out make you cringe (yeah me too) don t be afraid: this really isn t by and large bland tasteful crap re are moments and elements (shuffly beats ) that do recall all those tedious trip-hop moments we ve all been subjected to but there is a hallucinatory depth here and enough inspiration to lift it above the lemon jelly clones i can t help but mention the one really awful moment is some kind of throwback to agit-prop rave proselytizing with a highly embarrassing vocal ( without love strangers to the beat ) accompanying unsuccessful doomy atmospherics this contrasts with the stand-out moments such as a cover of ginny s can t be (popularized on royksopp s back to mine but first unearthed by of course harvey on his sarcastic disco compilation) which genuinely does improve on the original but my personal favourites are and which are extended proggy jazzy jams and unapologetically so if you have a low noodling tolerance forget it but if you enjoy the odd cosmic voyage this will definite get your rockets going one does feel that there s a little too much reverence paid to balearic history here and indeed that s the only possible explanation for mood is also a little too serious and head-nodding at times you can imagine this band wear really bad hats and it s definitely going to draw its fair share of tedious hippy admirers however i d like to believe in a better world which involves beaches and cute people in swimwear on holidays that never end so i m going to ignore my cynical side and embrace this album for its moments of quiet euphoria

not all repetitions are equal: good repetitions as beautiful loops ach contain both their own perpe ation and a constant motion toward something else th something different in each beat even just in relation to all its i ntical others a recent in rview here on ra with matt mr slave edwards cap res something of this hes right rry levan played really really really repetitive mu c but played it so long so well played it until something magic happened likewise villalobos but this approach isnt for everyone more: its something incredibly difficult fraught and elu ve cos loops lock loops lump and loops like these are dull proves here that she like levan and villalobos knows how to sort the ad loops from the living: (the whole) night long is time enough to dwell with her jazz-finding loop records and realise that this lady knows a living loop when she cuts one technically were back in the land of dj pre er: take a nicely c-ed up bar or four of jazz drums double bass some piano loop assemble x stir struc rally these clas c chniques breathe in a house struc re and given nidams style were closer to the ricardo villalobos of sei es drum than 90s hip-hop but nidam a touch and feel all her own where rv sounds are orbed warped and monged until theyre re rned repressed (we know that kick drums that have spent lots of time in rvs machines are never qui the same af rwards) nidams compo tions have a sober composed cal ng comfort to them rv is having a with borges in the harem of archime s here youre just in nidams kitchen and the a no spikes this is e nently likeable per able work: the recordings of cuban mu cians un rtaken by powershovelaudios reps are beautiful and nidam transformed them into something all her own something incredibly useful (as dj tools) that also make a real close lis ning treat dig in i say: play repeat
its inevitable but that doesnt make it less sad: after the exciting post-jungle of special request tessela et al it seems were already into the follow-up wave of revivalist knock-offs s debut is pure 90s throwback complete with hoovers piano stabs and aimless vocal garnish all of which makes the eps title we are new generation ironic p is the least inspired a summer of love rave track made two decades too late and devoid of its source materials frisson is better its pitch-bent stabs and flanged drums offering a slightly more nuanced take on jungle but its still uninspiring is a loosely swung and wholly forgettable house cut lightly sprinkled with breakbeats was making deep house a year ago it seems goldies about to replace kerri chandler in the sights of dance musics imitators
with erik satie and post-war minimalist composers like gavin bryars and charlemagne palestine looming large as powerful influences on many of todays ambient artists the pianos advances into the digital world have become an ambient subgenre of their very own by new york digital sound artists taylor deupree and kenneth kirschner quietly slipped out last october on the australian ambient imprint and ventures into this territory by documenting a live post-piano collaboration a 36-minute live set recorded last at the offf festival in lisbon is a single-track limited-edition disc that sees 12k founder taylor deupree reworking the effect-laden piano work of kenneth kirschner in real time last year the pair joined together for a series of live shows in which kirschner played a grand piano while deupree sat beside him manipulating the vibrations of the strings inside via his laptop though the process sounds like it should lead to some appealing results especially given the pedigree and experience of the players involved at this stage the collaboration still feels a bit too tentative to truly gel into a unique force unfolds slowly and meditatively with kirschner wandering across the keyboard never committing to a precise direction and instead using the keys to noodle an atmospheric through-line which deupree enhances with overdubs and trills that wash out the fringes belongs in the same category as ryuichi sakamotos collaborations with carsten nicolai and christian fennesz brian enos thursday afternoon or recent albums by type artists sylvain chauveau and goldmund and fans of those recordings will not be disappointed its hard not to enjoy a piano recording that ebbs and flows at a dreams pace yet the prospect remains that had been a studio effort in which deupree and kirschner spent more time cultivating a specific mood or focus the work might have registered a stronger impression on repeat listens as it stands s major problem is that it is what it is: a live performance in this context the duo play it safe in much the same way sakamoto and fennesz do on the 1 -minute live recording sala santa cecilia for sakamoto and fennesz cendre the studio evolution that came out a year later burned a lot brighter and though makes for a pleasant listening experience the stamp of either deupree or kirschner both known for way more individualistic and memorable work than this isnt fully imprinted yet but it could be given the opportunity

in pril 2014 terrence dixon announced his retirement from making music since then he released theater of confused mind on rush hour and nine eps some under his alias and others shared with producers like fred p michael zucker and einka i wrote to dixon in late december in hopes of clarifying the situation but all that can be said for now is that his singular brand of high-strung minimalism keeps coming nd for a lot of people thatll do just fine 12-inches were once keepers of dixons most out-there material like hippnotic culture s deeply paranoid and isolated frontier of fast slender techno these days seems more like a change of outfit than a whole other persona and the title track of dixons latest ep and one of his most straightforward dance floor tracks to date underscores that lashing 909 hi-hats and concussive kicks prop up bass pads that stick together like wet pages the muted percussion often takes a back seat to glacial loops and alien textures but s bold frame is a striking change of pace is more familiar underneath an icy melody smooth bass notes move up and down in a frantic unbroken line and soft kicks keep time behind discordant synth bleeps it has a shrill and somewhat astringent tone but qualities that could be off-putting in the hands of other producers are dixons hallmarks
with each record were reminded of the projects beginnings as a pair of overseas collaborators making sound installations its a notable origin story though not always obvious in the duos animated dance music on their fourth release together rich mcmaster and tom marshallsay have pushed that quirky freeform production approach to the forefront of their sound the fit of passion settled on a straightforward kind of sample-heavy house rare earth metal plumbed the stranger ends of the dance floor and now hearing combines those modes into two capricious tunes the number of micro-samples fx and instruments crammed into s title cut will boggle anyone trying to keep track mcmaster and marshallsay seem to have emptied their hard drives of all percussive sound fragments dropping them into the broken groove like corn kernels waiting for their chance to pop they sporadically douse the drum hiccups and bass pulses in synth color which rounds out the frequency spectrum and gives the beat some quasi-melodic panache hearing has all the energy and unpredictability of a super ball and yet those unexpected wiggles jumps and sidesteps couldnt be more inviting or easier to move along with doesnt have such an untethered sound at seven minutes long it runs through a dubby soundscape with steady 4/4 rhythms and thick sub bumps whats most unexpected here is how restrained sound in comparison to their a-side it works well for the pair however especially as an exhibition of the vibrant house they can conjure from more subdued material is among their less distinctive tracks but the bespoke samples and detailed arrangement are clear reminders of the producers shared background
so its obvious he has a thing about words ending in er indeed why break the tradition given the success he has had impeccable xpander the timeless irdrawn gger nd now so sasher sorry is back and bmg not to mention the fans have been on his back keen for a new slice of musical pie since his previous solo compilation in 1999 gu013 ibiza (touted as one of the greatest mix cds of its time) e can only imagine the immense pressure he would have been under in creating an album set to be one of the most revered compared and reviewed albums of first two introductory tracks feature immaculate vocals y play the vital part of setting a strongly produced slate for to present the rest of the mix with a perfect lead in beautiful and highly regarded ys by stockholm born newcomer receives a brief touch of s recreation it does work very well and is surprisingly the only track on the cd without some form of vocal it leads and continues nicely into the warming are you to me mix that follows it is the two remakes of tracks originally released in 2002 where really starts to get down the business end of things with firstly ngsters with their smile featuring a strong bassline and the raw electro sounds that have made the french artists so successful charlie may duncan forbes well known for their previous progressive productions under their moniker continue the mix with belong and s new edit original mix prior to s touch is undoubtedly one of the finest ambient progressive releases of its kind so it is no surprise that this update is nothing short of exceptional its brought in ever so simply with julie skes beautiful female vocals that work their way into your head and you will become addicted nd then the simple and understated bassline drops in followed by the thick and amazingly formed chords roll through the track that together with the vocals cement it as extraordinary slotting in seamlessly is his new remix of s state this mix proves the point of the excessive time has put into being (as many of you would know) his second take on the track (the first featuring on james lavelles barcelona gu026 comp) and i must add his most impressive by far making both his previous and the original look average at best simple energetic uplifting and vibrant following on is his rework of burma the latest track from melbourne based production duo phil k (one of ustralia s finest djs) and luke chable (one of ustralias finest producers) be honest it isn t their best work and the original left a fair bit to be desired but has filled the void really taking it to the next level it needed with this twelve minute version it is at this moment 60 odd minutes in where i need to stop and make the point that you can not fault with much on the music he has presented would be hard pressed to find a mix out in the current period that comes close to this sequence of music this being said the faultless ride appears to slide to an abrupt halt with the next track beginning of the end of this amazing climb through music is his tweak of s by it is definitely the weakest link in this compilation sure its electro and that may be a cool thing at the moment it could widen the appeal and maybe sell a few extra copies and on its own it is some nice production but it doesn t suit the compilation as a whole re are just 2 pieces that remain to be slotted in this 10 piece puzzle and this isnt one that fits worst of all it leaves the final track somewhat stranded it is only when it mixes away to the electro vocal of i am no cyber whore that things get back on track driving bassline of s stunning remix of own is the homerun that knocks into the stratosphere of legendary music he turns s previously ambient sounds into a peak time dance floor filler and you will be hearing this tune right throughout summer overall is at the top of his game mix thats compiled edited remixed mastered and produced to near perfection

after reviewing the first sin ep not too long ago return with the second instalment funnily enough known as 2 more original works that are sure to please those that found the first ep to their liking on the a-side is sad girls and it begins with a simple 4/4 drum pattern that soon builds into a nice electro synth melody the drums build as the track soon hits a peak and then momentarily takes a break before launching into a full assault on the dancefloor not a track for the faint hearted on the flip is under pressure another big track designed for the floors this production begins with some nice melodies that soon launch into a flurry of drums and droning base stabs it maintains a similar flow throughout occasionally stopping for breath and is designed for a peak time slot in a set another energetic production from the sinners another good instalment with 2 productions that have that danny howells techno/house fell to them if you like your music with plenty of energy and balls check these tracks out
some partnerships are so natural that they seem like fate or maybe just dumb luck im not sure what john barera would cite as the force behind his ongoing collaboration with will martin but whatever it is its potent compare reality or this years yen ep with bareras solo work and you wont find any dramatic differences other than a spark that martin seems to bring out in his companion that spark ignited into a full flame for an album recorded in such an intense bout of inspiration that barera told me they couldnt even remember what happened afterwards the duo have found another friend in steffi whose label is the perfect home for their honest and introspective house music martin and barera are just as suited to deliver s first full-length which is warm welcoming and effortlessly groovy cruises by over eight no-nonsense tracks the same approach makes many dance music albums a chore but it works for barera and martin primarily because of their intricate but unfussy songwriting these are long loopy tracks but they sound like two guys jamming on equipment full of slight changes and improvisations to keep your attention catch the drum fills between beats on or its sly little keyboard runs touches that give the downcast lazy-afternoon house a vivid flair on other tunes theyre more bubbly: all the elements on feel like theyre running up and down scales until they get dizzy while its marvellously sprinkles bits of disco into their breezy chicago template with well-timed guitar jabs and a falsetto vocal thatll float around in your head for days its ironic that barera and martin would choose as the title for their debut album because almost everything about their music exudes grace and poise the title track is a smorgasbord of pleasing textures including warm electric piano caressing strings and a gently nudging bassline it all unfolds gradually surprising and delighting with each new development even when they introduce harsher elements like the booming dub techno chords on its done with a loving care that makes it feel comforting again and again the duo find ways to put their spin on well-worn sounds the moment you throw on and hear its gently thumping rhythm section you feel like youve been here before theyre working in a completely familiar template but in the same way that its hard to pin-down exactly what makes martin and barera so good together its difficult to describe what it is they bring to house music that makes so magical sometimes it does feel like magic or maybe as barera might say its just chemistry
rorschach test is one of clinical psychologys most famous tools but its widely misunderstood and for the moment rather unloved in most places for a techno label the appeal of ambiguous black and white images is obvious my fascination with 3 has as much to do with considering the process of making and playing these tracks as with the music or its visual motif for example: i wonder how wild dance floors could get when served by s itchy techno tracks and are cut for big rooms but the top layers of texture installs in both are as sumptuous as they are confounding (on vapour from a glassy pad is occupied by what sounds like a balloon being twisted and tied over and over again ) s contributions are equally imaginative a simple synth squiggle is wound so tightly around that it becomes completely disorienting despite not much changing across its six minutes rhythmic shifts are as perceptible as they are deniable s ping pong chords are less of a puzzle emphasising space over s dizzy motion but theyre of a piece with the rest of 3 a release whose artwork is the most straightforward thing about it
for those who dont know was actually a champion bullfighter before producing some of the best techno on the planet on his latest release for sender he once again teases us with his red musical capote drunken descent sends a dark and heavy message with lots of peripheral noises and strange effects before all swiftly coming together a tightly sequenced spectrum of sci-fi meets seedy berlin nightclub whiskey galore continues the same vibe with a building melody twisting into reverse vocal effects this one has a very peak time sound with room to build or break down takes it down a notch with a floating synth and long deep bass until the electric melody kicks in giving a more psychedelic feel to the track these three racks are the perfectly typify the sender sound and represent the advanced stages of the techno scene

on the lead-off single to their forthcoming full-length the aussie duo of ryan grieve and leo thomson forsake the jackin house they built for tracks on im a cliche and dfa letting loose in its place a galloping dance rock tune that bears the arena-sized boldness of kicks -era inxs while going from underground sounds to a full-fledged pop tune represents more than a small step forward for them nevertheless manage to stay afloat in untested waters backing up their chutzpah with chops and craft the tune opens with big jumbo-jet filters that come in for a landing and let bouncy feel-good piano chords and congas take over providing a solid rhythmic bed for heart-on-the-sleeve crowd-pleasing vocals: youre my rescue then theres a gospel-y breakdown reminiscent of screamadelica in remix mode wooden ships stay true to their san francisco roots by twisting the tune into a psych-rock stomper replete with lysergic guitar howl and a hippie-trance beat droned-out and doped-up it probably should have come packed with its own super 8 projection dr aka rub-n-tugs eric duncan meanwhile was seemingly distressed by the originals abrupt fade out and so he retools it for a ten-minute long haul duncans gone and left mostly well enough alone the five minutes he adds onto are filled up quite nicely by just giving elements from the original room to stretch out
the flying dutchman is back again this time with the second release on his label the follow up to the wonderful a dedicated mind voorn has collaborated with names like kowalski deetron f e o s and technasia on many different projects and his time given to music production has produced consistent results since the year 2000 check his groovin club techno facelift of justin berkovis rising on music man which has been causing quite a stir of late many reasons combines silky-synth textures with a strong booming bassline to give this track a sense of beauty but also a flowing energy that surges forth if youve heard voorns dont believe everything you see or his rework of pascal f e o s flashed back then you should be familiar with his penchant for detroit influenced techno-soul this track just keeps on building and building with a decadent synth-line rippling out at you in waves many reasons has definite carl craig influences and this track is indeed getting plenty of support from fans of deeper techno on the flip joris dumps his silky-synthesiser on mpx 309 and goes straight for the jugular with a stompin drum-led track resembling something weve heard from hardfloor loads of reverb and delay give the hi-hats some real presence throughout this track along with a couple of huge swells where that acid-techno thumpin bassline drops out to allow the hi-end to get busy theres no time to mess about as this pulsating piece of driving techno gets to work on our cerebellum causing sudden jerky movements high temperature and sweating - all symptoms of a good night on the dancefloor this release is another gem from and further compounds his status as a major force many reasons is quite a cracker while mpx 309 will definitely delight dancers who like the heads down stuff so for many many reasons this is a must for all you lovers of groovy electronic experiments
at first glance the pairing of ellen allien and apparat may be something of a surprise with the two on somewhat different musical trajectories: apparat exploring a highly emotional idm sound while allien raves up dancefloors with her distinct brand of noisy pop techno however their music is more similar than you would think both are residents of berlin (allien even markets herself as a born-and-bred native) and in a city famous for its transplanted djs and producers the pair come closest to producing a uniquely berlin sound : a fractured broken soundscape informed by pop structures but for the dancefloor tempered by an occasional moodiness in fact they have collaborated before: apparat is humbly credited as producing some drum sounds on alliens berlinette though rumour has it his hands were all over it apparat usually releases on his own label shitkatapult but he also pops up on alliens bpitch most notably with his koak 12 the idea of a fully-fledged pairing then is natural the only surprise is the explicit double billing hasnt come sooner the result is an album of faintly-tinged melancholic glitch that carry the listener along with electronic textures that bounce and bubble the two artists complement each other: allien s minty-cool vocals and muscular dancefloor rhythms mesh well with apparat s fractured glitches and beats opener turbo dreams catches them in the act with its throbbing bass buzzes whirs and electric guitar riffs combining to create a feeling of speed turbo indeed the album moves through a number of styles: retina and the grimestepping metric have sampled cello do not break is full of scratching the melody of the stately edison could be a zither and leave me alone is a pop ballad plain and simple yet the album is unified by the lurking rhythms that burble bounce and bubble through it lending it a vibrant buoyancy this is clearly seen in jet and floating points; the latter bounces around like a ping-pong ball surprisingly the album has only four vocal tracks pop-like structures mostly sung by allien with apparat singing the happily mournful ballad leave me alone on way out one of the album s standout tracks alliens vocals slide then soar up the register over a distorting electric guitar and quick beats closer bubbles is a wonderfully muted affair with allien s whispered voice gliding across a cool landscape allien and apparat complement each other well but they are meeting in the middle and the album sometimes misses the most interesting extremes of each artist apparat pulls back on the glitches creating a smoother ride than usual but as a consequence the album never really hits the more intense and emotional fractured depths he usually plumbs meanwhile with a couple of exceptions the album never cleans up the dancefloor in thorough allien fashion nonetheless is a strong home-listening album one hopes that the pairing of allien and apparat is an orchestra that will play on and compose more symphonies
after a busy 2014 this year has so far been much quieter for the turin/berlin-based gang of ducks their self-described handmadecyberspiritualpunksci-lo-fi output limited to an ep from sabla and an album from xiii brooklyns daniel martin-mccormick aka appeared as a remixer on that sabla record and here he makes his full debut on the label first three tracks on are among the most floor-ready material gang of ducks has released title track and all clock in around the 130 bpm mark and will fit well into dark techno sets albeit ones in dank warehouses rather than festival marquees each is an effective exercise in crescendo-building with standing out in particular thanks to its fevered arps and industrial clank a beatless ambient flow of soft keys and whispered voices that would have fit well on martin-mccormicks excellent endgame lp from last year is a sudden but pleasant change of pace gang of ducks themselves finish up with a remix of it bears little resemblance to the original but its murky growl and scattered beats add another dimension to the ep
new yorks has officially moved from skippy 2-step to chunky disco last years hit gone bad first signalled the change and his debut for 00 silk (and most high-profile release yet) drives this approach towards classic house album-length ep finds in the same boat as countless other producers channeling the spirit of chicago but theres a sincerity and earthiness here that makes it a cut above the rest sounds like a collage of dusty old records pivoting on a fleet-footed breakbeat and throwing a bunch of horn riffs on top while layers synths on synths and finishes it all off with some pleasant chimes both are retro but s tracks (or his samples) have the warmth of the old music hes evoking has a stutter to its step that quickly proves addictive and these little details are what help to pull it above mere pastiche flipside is less impressive breaks out the bongos loading the leisurely and the melting tones of with sumptuous hand percussion but both are sleepily complacent ambling along without much verve its the closing that points the right way forward though not quite the gatecrasher its name would imply with its cinematic chords it reaches the heights of hit gone bad giving way to euphoric waves that are kept in check by the gently percolating percussion its an exercise in restraint a skill that the still-fresh faced producer will likely do well with in the future

much has been made of dance musics transition from the real to the virtual and of the concomitant shift in our understanding of the dj/artist distinction the likes of hawtin sasha and surgeon have been mining that grey area for years (to varying degrees of success) whilst joris voorns recent balance mix pretty much epitomised the creative promiscuity afforded by current technology but relatively little has been explored by way of concrete commercial output until now that is released as the first in a series of three concept eps s is practically a call to arms comprised of three original tracks alongside all their constituent parts (arranged comprehensively into fourteen tools) its a bewildering collection of sounds some interwoven others bare and isolated as a reviewer im tempted to narrow my focus simply to three discrete tracks on display each representing a different shade of deep club minded techno somewhere in the vicinity of audion and function the most rewarding of which is the hypnotic undulating which seems custom made for those still going on a sunday afternoon but something bigger is going on here the fact the one of the pieces is already a finished remix means were essentially given an opportunity to remix a remix (and so on ad infinitum should we wish) or in the case of the other two tracks the budding dj cum producer is given the chance to one up kg himself extended further another somewhat daunting possibility is the construction of an entire live set as has recently been done by the man himself for the mnml ssgs blog id suggest that anyone curious heads in that direction: hearing the master and his tools in full flow is nothing short of inspirational and evocative of a world of possibilities a generous offering from a quietly pioneering producer one has the feeling that this is only the tip of a very large iceberg
is one of the stranger things to emerge from horo samurais sister label inspired by dantes inferno the anonymous duo behind the name take the horo sound a blend of techno drum bass and experimental music and infuse it with the occult they end up somewhere between lustmord and the latter-day work of ulver their first ep set the scene and it was a solid debut with speaker-rattling drones pounding drums and ominous screeches followed it with a stellar remix ep from lucy that hinted at some crossover ambition and now they return with original material that further ups the ante on beef up their arsenal with blaring horns layered field recordings and chanted vocals the first track ii [anger] gives you a good idea of what youre in for: scrapes and creaks make way for bellowing horns as the drums rattle like chains drums are the most bewitching element of chapter 2 on heresy they pound rapidly and unsteadily on fraud all kinds of percussion are strung together into what sounds like some kind of twisted ritual part tribal part techno part jungle fraud is the eps most jarring track and probably s best packed with creepy sounds and blood-curdling screams its not for the faint of heart and could also register as cheesy depending on your appetite for this stuff in their quest to sound evil nearly take it too far at their most predictable they evoke the soundtrack of a b movie but at their best they make towering walls of sound with ingenuity and imagination
theres nothing i hate more than being predictable but it has to be said really and s is the sort of track that makes you despair for dance floors three minutes of a looped organ bit a kick that wont quit and then the climax nd by climax i mean a voice saying come on over and over and over again as it builds and builds and builds before being let down slowly it took three guys to make this track nick curly deleted this thing from his hard drive in 2006 i have nothing against dj tools brothers vibe is the maestro of the genre and ribcage was once stupidly slated for the same reasons that gets on my nerves nd you can tell that it works like a charm on the dance floor but the amount of imagination that went into its construction is minimal nd so is its shelf life if youre a dj and youre not playing something at the same time that this is playing youre doing your crowd a disservice on the b side thankfully things get interesting: dops remix of s puts a kick over what sounds like someone brushing their teeth and jonathan jojo illel talks about rich girls meanwhile gets the last slot on the vinyl and reveals that the original had plenty of piano a nearly out of control singer who takes over the bridge and and beat programming that rivals stimming in its intricacy theres two sides here clearly dance floors would be better served by more of the second
last we heard from perc on was his especially tame remix of chevels heimweh that same year ali wells joined up with danny passarella for a david cronenberg-inspired soundtrack ep videodrome which also left his brutality at the door instead it was broody and dark instilling fear and panic in a much more psychological sense which is also true of a poised techno psych-out designed to unravel us from within opens with dissonance and a throbbing 4/4 pulse its doomy and unsettling with metal clanging all around opts for an even more venomous kick while haunted-house pianos and strange collisions ring out their threats rattles erratically into life it takes up 12 spine-chilling minutes with searing machine noises and metallic hits that reverberate moan and squeal res a great live feel to but it tends to get lost in itself leaving the rest of us behind overall the ep is a decent leap out of the box for perc even if he goes too far with the title track
the track youve been waiting for doesnt come until the end of s new ep so lets start at the beginning isnt too far off from labelmate jam city with its grime-friendly basslines and skronky synths until it fades out into a lush synth section in endorphin overdrive is like i r l mk ii with exaggerated rhythms slamming down into a vacuum chamber of reverb but even that tails off into a coda of blissful timbaland-isms notice a pattern here nearly every track is drizzled with luminescent syrup from the funk pastiche of (with its flashbang synth flares) or especially which explores tinny bombast via artificial horn fanfares and regal melodies s if to wash the taste of listeners mouths is unforgiving and harsh broken up by the occasional 808 cowbell thats melted down and molded into a melody track six is the one though the funny thing about is it doesnt have much of a conventional structure: it goes from zero to 60 in well 60 bursting into the same nearly-parodic euphoria as wut imagine ten stacked synthesizers all screaming in overheated agony at their highest octave the track pulls back into squirrely build-up mode twice an unbearable level of tension before it simply peters out in glowstick glory muscles weary it never quite reaches flashpoint holding itself at a plateau of captured bliss like a bee buzzing frantically inside a mason jar even though is working with mostly the same sounds he was two years ago he sounds more relevant than ever here it could just be good timing or that he remains the same ingeniously innovative songwriter but is yet another victory for the young producer
hong kongs has been doing the hard yards lately and by that i mean hes been pulling out the hard nu-skool breaks and the latest one from his label continues on that same level side a eco complex breakbeat pattern with the hi-hats going crazy eco is identified by a nice continuous bassline which doesnt seem to want to stop for a breather add in a few bassline tweaks and a few builds for some peak time set business halfway through the song the beat slows to half the original tempo and the tech elements go mad with plenty of warps and twists - good to f*ck peoples heads with especially the djs side b namo namo sounding like something from a japanese cartoon namo namo starts off with some commentary/documentary samples on top of some minimal drum elements namely a hit hat and snare drum taps a bit more of an atmospheric tune this tune is for a laidback section of a set once the drums kick in a few girly pop samples are thrown in and a warpy bassline personally eco is the tune to get in this release whereas namo namo feels a bit too trancey and weird
came onto the scene in 2010 with dixtrit a roller with jerky pianos punctuating a warm undercurrent that came complete with a jimpster remix which was included in harri and dominics ra podcast old joanna is back out in force for the ep but instead of a quirky inventive style theyve gone this time for an old school retrospective res a straightforward 909 beat on a heavy piano chord motif and suspended strings overhead freeranges mission statement is to release innovative and soulful music and with this track have got the latter (at the very least) down pretty well is is more deep house but again devoid of anything approaching cutting-edge hi-hats shuffle on the offbeat and there are various little rhythmic vocal snippets underlaid with a smooth moody humming underneath taking this away and adding a fat bassline and more piano chords brings the piano mix back towards s territory again its good stuff but with the track not hitting any particular high whether it would stand out and enthrall particularly on the dance floor is another matter
the interweb knows many things but it doesn t know if cosmo vitelli is cosmo vitelli s birth name or a pseudonym either way it s a fucking great name for someone who makes automobile-obsessed electronic disco records cosmo fully lives up to his name with this latest offering from him and julien riffaz as part of df s series by is the uptempo side here getting into the car theme with atmospheric clanks car horns and chimes leading into one of those driving fast at night kind of insistent rhythms the track shifts from acidy squelches to smoother guitar licks and back again and constantly evokes images of well-groomed italian men in sports coats driving their lancias through mountain tunnels at speed which is all very modish but also highly danceable getting intense enough to make you spill your prosecco towards the end the midtempo track on the -side however is the real star here sets out its stall with ambulance sirens and a chugging rhythm which mutates into a monster-truck of a riff simultaneously euphoric and ominous while camp-horror vocals intone sensations / escape me / you rape me / i cry cowbells and congas complete the picture as the track develops making this into that most priceless of records for the disco dj a track you can play at the end of your slow set before you start playing the fast records or to be honest a great party tune for anyone

over the past couple years the crew a collection of local djs and producers from aarhus denmark has put out at least 25 records ts tough to say exactly how much music their core producers central sports c k optic_ and manmade deejay have released as they work across a maze of labels collaborative projects and aliases as central real name natal zaks told xlr8r thats the curious part of being a record digger or music enthusiast trying to dig trying to understand f everything is presented in a clear way then its a bit less exciting ts been a natural if fast build for the danish crew a record-digging facebook group led to parties parties led to a label and now the label has an anthem: hi mount c k s most of the producers have alternated between breakbeat-anchored ambience and anthemic shambolic house a collaboration from hi mount (the new trio of central ph 1 sports) and c k (2 bit crews christoffer kejlstrup) is the first time theyve embraced pop they lift a tremulous vocal from a 90s gospel or r b record adding their own bittersweet accompaniment with digital pianos and flutes n keeping with the 90s vibe this record includes three mixes of the first mix shapes the longing vocal into contemplative electro pop the club mix cleverly switches the bassline to a dive-bombing uk-influenced figure coupled with a slamming house kick and the original vocal and pianos this one could be a melancholic speed garage obscurity the deep mix is most like the ambience of previous releases but theres a second wave detroit feel to the nuanced percussive shifts pristine arpeggios and hammering two-note bassline no matter the version the musics backbone a longing wail of know and its cascading echo transcends style making for one of the years memorable tracks

james connolly likes to keep us on our toes as -vis 1990 he can lay claim to probably the most varied (in both style and quality) discography of the night slugs roster and he continues to explore divergent interests while the hybrid forms of last years ballads ep took cues from bok bok or jam city connolly has in parallel been developing a taste for straighter hardware workouts first there was 2012s club constructions vol 1 a collection of diamond-hard retro-futurist machine jams that drew on ghetto house 80s jack tracks and pummeling loop techno then came circuits its follow up for clones jack for daze which covered similar ground but in a manner that felt less vital and perhaps a little more like retro-pastiche - follows the same vector but this time connolly is working under a new alias dance system deploys a little of the raunchy bump of cajmeres percolator ; the offbeat two-note synth riff in is lifted straight from 80s chicago house both are polished and entirely functional but lacking in spark with its tinny sampled chords looks set to go the same way but its ostentatious tempo wind-down improves the shock quotient somewhat and tips a more direct nod to connollys influences by drawing on the vocal talents of dance mania stalwart between its scratchy rubber band riff and s sampled exhortations this one has more going for it even if its still essentially treading water in a decades-old pool
while it was chiefly californian labels most notably san diegos siesta that soundtracked the west coast house explosion at the turn of the century there was also a northern outpost in the shape of luke mckeechans vancouver-based for their latest ep nordic looks to veteran brighton producer pete ogston who turns in a clutch of velvety deep house tracks the spritely bassline of offers a gentle introduction leaving it to the fluid head-nodding to move the ep up a gear whether by accident or design its crunchy skipping percussion harks back to the sound that percolated through mckeehans landmark compilation lazy transmissions back in 2002 the nearest thing to a bum note is a slice of lazy disco house that tensnake would probably leave languishing on his hard drive although ogston wrests back the initiative on a smart poolside jaunt that overflows with washes of electric piano and analogue keys doesnt break any new ground; instead it disarms you with its charming radiance

it sounds as if was in awe of the company he was about to keep when deciding on his tracklisting for the latest in s premier series he talks in the booklet of waiting for clearance for dozens of tracks finally whittling them down to the 24 included and mixing them in his own music room unlike previous s from danny tenaglia and tony humphries this one is mixed and sounds all the better for it its an audacious start too with the jerky rhythms of savage progress heart begins to beat a kind of trip to chicago for siouxsie sioux there are clear signs of an early house music style developing in the staple singers slippery people the seriously funky i love it from trussel and a rare mix of kid creole and the coconuts tune yolanda turned on its head lil louis appears again as on so many of these influential compilations with his nyce slo proving way ahead of its time with arcade style bleeps - and theres classic funk from rick james who was certainly born to funk and roll in the big time a favourite of mine on this disc though was the euphoric layered vocals of patrick cowleys get a little written in 1981 no less cd2 continues the high quality trend frankie knuckles classic baby wants to ride with jamie principle is included in the house of trix version and the appealing problemes damour from alexander robotnick is deadpan funky and cheeky - listen to the subtle synth touches round the edges easy to say where jacques lu cont gets his style from jean-paul gaultier (yes him ) is included with how to do that and the crooklyn mix of buzzin cuzzins let me show you love is another rarity romanthony on vocals most importantly though this collection helps us understand s current style - disco funk and house all twisted together and shows that while this may not be a selection of his complete favourites (thanks to licensing) that he can plan and execute his dj mixes to perfection
from functional bangers to more reflective pieces if is anything hes reliable this makes the fact that hes often overlooked all the more frustrating chances are when you think of berlin techno you dont think of this british transplant for the fifth ep on his own label he goes straight for the jugular shrugging off his ethereal side and leaving behind only the basics is deadly peak-time techno with a single dissonant bleep and some chopped-up vocal grunts as window dressing its simple and beguiling: the vocal samples blur into the hi-hat for a distinctly wet smear of sound while distant strings merely suggest a melody in the backdrop ripples forward like a shark racing through water and this time the attack comes from sharp stabbing snares though theres little in the way of breathing room a sleek synth figure wriggles in for the second half hinting at davenports more melodic work as inland finally is techno with a house panache as if he dropped some heavy steel framework on top of some old funky house tune
are black rain (stuart rgabright) and orphan swords (yannick franck and pierre de m elenaere) last year rgabright was in holland where he was commissioned by rewire festival to perform an improvised noise set with pete swanson and vessel shortly afterwards the new yorker went to nearby brussels where franck and de m elenaere are based is the result of one night of shamanic sound exchange trios union goes back further than 2016 s ike yard rgabright contributed spoken-word vocals to a track on orphan swords debut ep for desire records y have also remixed each other check out black rains grim version of smoday so the trio share a lot in common rgabrights industrial techno is informed by band-based psychedelia which is what you get with orphan swords is an audacious recording that demands to be played loud or better yet heard live in the front row of a gig booming kick drum heralds the dirge of rc as heavy noise textures gather and darken mourning vocals arrive later amplifying the dreary choking atmosphere piece rides out on a wave of searing electronics squealing their last breaths is seductive and more rhythmic so its 14 minutes breeze by crescendo is awesome but stealthy enough not to disrupt the jams powerful spell
efore ostgut ton came a-calling was just your average auto industry suit spending the better part of his free time on international flights to whichever far-flung afterparty required his services now of course elliott resides in erlin and does techno full-time elliott has been synonymous with for so long (hes their r man on the ground in erlin) that it comes as a bit of a shock that is his first 12-inch for the label and it should serve his fellow airport-weary techno slaves well which is an important point: if isnt utterly standout its because its the sort of glue that allows more anthemic tracks to shine in a club set elliotts sounds are right on point with its bass swells especially well-crafted and physical the remix from the mysterious st lo is probably more likely to turn heads slower and more playfully melodic its as if was fed psychedelics and released into the forest for a few hours still as the releases black cover and minimalist design touches suggest these are tracks and theyll need expert sequencing and a big sound rig to really come into their own
have a broader range than most over the last three years brothers benjamin julian and louis simon helliker-hales have made everything from 808 cowbell drum tracks for clekclekboom to synth-reinforced techno for amadeus records now on theyve delivered a drowsy soul-soaked house ep with piano and low-key sax solos culled from dimly lit jazz bars reflects the tangled knot of hip-hop soul jazz funk and house at the centre of while a lot of the ep is very good it lacks the mercurial touch the new zealanders have demonstrated on other releases (in particular the excellent disco-funk workouts of 816 to nunhead ) s nocturnal jazz tones evoke the imagined atmosphere of its title but you could also enjoy it anytime anywhere the sprightliest of the four tracks tosses staccato piano and cymbal strokes onto a soothing bed of strings though good in their own right and cover ground that feels sufficiently explored by and the smacking drums of common unity a digital bonus featuring archie pelago wouldve added some welcome variety to the 12-inch

sabina plamenovas problem has primarily been one of presentation: just when we think that weve got her measure the london producer moves on to pastures new many will know her as subeena releasing spartan dubstep in 2007/08 and by 2010 robust house on her opit imprint her own vocals became an increasingly prominent feature until last year saw subeena reborn as initially the project seemed to have clear pop intentions but before long club forms were being drawn back into its orbit the hybrids in the attic album self-released in december featured thunderous techno alongside vocal-led pop and the odd icy dubstep number it was enough to hear plamenovas fingerprints but the lack of stylistic focus could understandably prove frustrating for some the ep then is welcome in its singular focus released on dont be afraid this is an unambiguously club-focussed ep though plenty of plamenova trademarks are retained in tightly layered vocals spiral over a muscular techno thump while in the title track they function as euphoric breakdown fodder a welcome respite from beefy gated snares and a churning kraftwerkian synth line both feature gaseous pads that recall early 90s hardcore techno their mix-downs are a little murky making for a somewhat fatiguing listen is the highlight proving (as with 2010s pictures ) that plamenova is at her best when she lets those thick metallic synth melodies lead the way finally proves ripe for dmarc tus rework; he turns in a typically cool and collected remix all gauzy pads and flickering grids of hi-hats
thanks to another keen a r stroke from one of the games finest now get a foot up to the next level and find themselves here on will sauls after previous efforts on throne of lood and love fever its their best yet (made in conjunction with fellow northern irish producer ) keeps things anchored to the dance floor with some fulsome all-consuming kicks while echoing female cries try to soar over and over again it makes for a great bit of tension and the heavy-hearted chords that circle below only add to the feeling dont this time made with help from aka serge santiago unfolds much more freely however and arguably with more infectious results the beats tumble downwards every bar pulling you deep into their midst where another snatched vocal gasps for breath full of pomp and personality yet dripping with cool its the sort of charming banger weve come to expect from aus steffis contribution is a quick-licked deep house remix of that surfs on warm synth currents chattery claps and only a faint impression of the originals incendiary vocal more cluttered than anything on her debut lp from last year it still retains that sense of surging yet sensuous urgency that has characterised her output thus far
this us label has been gathering a growing legion of followers since the start with floorshaking house music and this release sees them bringing us a summer biggie from featuring melanie s gets a double dose of action with the first slice in the shape of future mix its a thumping house number from the start with a smooth and sexy blend of darkened bassline and energised beats which create a smooth progression of sound the vocal eases through gradually as wet percussive sounds lurk around in between breaking for a moment as the full effect of the vocal takes over along with a stabby synthetic string melody that shows a slightly scarier side flip it over and were treated to the victor calderone tkc remix together they take a heavyweight look at the original with military precision placed in the workings of the drums and bassline creating an incessant pressure behind a fuller mix of stabby sounds that hit off each other if thats not enough the vocal is placed ontop twisting the groove from its deep setting to something that flowers gradually with the use of powerful tones and tribal rhythms this is probably tweekd finest release to date with the sensual vocals of melanie s adding a completly richer edge to the workings of the track
panoramabar 04 begins with the lolling keyboard tones and gently skipping drums of a seattle based house producer whose mellow beats couldnt be more appropriate for initiating nick h ppners turn at the helm of the berlin clubs mix series h ppner is known for being half of erstwhile tech house duo my my and also managing the clubs label meanwhile the productions and sets under his own name betray a tasteful ear for melody though hes been known to allow any number of genres into his record bag panoramabar 04 is a straight up house affair the kind youd hear at the club once the sun has started to peek through the closed blinds of p bar on sunday morning nlike previous entries namely prosumers and cassys which were mixed quickly and almost roughly h ppners has the careful pace of something designed not for a club set but for posterity thats not to take away from its efficacy or its danceability fact the elegant gait of h ppners ing blinks steadily in the dark but grows deceptively larger with each passing bar until were halfway through and jumpy percussion is saturating every corner of the stereo spectrum h ppners selections are techy but soulful clinking metal that occasionally sparks bursts of colour with the panning chords of s or the playground whimsy of tracks sidle up into the mix quietly meekly pushing aside the old as the brittle chord structures interact and play off each other h ppner sticks to tracks with a distinct sense of space low on midrange presence so that these gears interlock ever more intricately deed the mixing approaches an inhuman perfection that somehow sidesteps the clinical grid mapping of minimal cruising along like a convertible re are little bumps to keep things from total linearity like the the soca esque syncopation in s ttend or the cheeky dropouts in the discs latter quadrant but for the most part this is a smooth ride that bubbles up to a simmer without quite ever reaching boiling point thats a quality it shares with ben klocks mix in the counterpart berghain series because by the end with choice cuts from and the groove just feels like its starting to heat up set aglow with warm textures and basslines s s sputters in the penultimate slot a familiar gravelly drum track comes in announcing the entrance of one of the years most ubiquitous and celebrated tracks in ndres 4 distinctive disco strings swoop in and knock s track out immediately a decisive strike thats all the more thrilling for its uncharacteristic rashness ndres track is the moment the blinds thrust open and clubbers are bathed in the light of the approaching day a celebratory encapsulation of one of the most distinctive aspects of one of the worlds most distinctive clubs
dubstep may have a monopoly on wobble but strikes back on pt a surly brawler of a house track whose shuddering low end recalls zzido da ass 1999 anthem dooms night it kicks off relatively demurely with a crisp shuffling drum groove fleshed out with tuned toms and watery string pads ut that melancholy restraint gives way to something far more primal that bass has something to do with it poised somewhere between foghorn blast and the bellow of a wooly mammoth and a yowling vocal melody drives home the tracks essential animal nature cornered wounded and entirely unconcerned with niceties like prettiness and pitch to the contrary the way the voice slides between the notes only adds to the drama reinforcing the sense of being sucked down in quicksand that said it would have been nice to have an instrumental version for those occasions when youre not feeling quite so ronze ge hunting-party although hrdvsions remix also does the trick he keeps his interventions minimal removing the vocal and giving the drums a faintly garage-y re-shuffle its still plenty ominous suffused in rolling war drums and distant banshee wail

fter a year of steady releases the man sometimes known as drum bass producer marcus intalex finds himself entrenched in the worldwide techno community in a way that countless hopefuls could only dream of his tracks were given the seal of approval from techno demigod ben klock who threw on his acclaimed fabric 66 cd last year and now releases it through his imprint you might expect klocks taste in to centre on the projects most merciless missives but youd be wrong in this case does sound pretty ominous though and not just because the climax features portentous strings beneath its nimble kicks lay slovenly chords that bellow like foghorns and the whole thing gallops with a looseness you dont often get with techno of this nature while is definitely the eps standout the other two make decent enough bedfellows is a no-frills tool with a gloopy bassline and clanging metal sample (and not much else) while is a little more ambitious that one borrows the dread of and drapes it over a pseudo 2-step pattern a reminder that even while tries to fit in with his new community hes still finding new things to bring to the table

acre and filter dread are excellent choices for the relaunch of visionists label which returns as a pan imprint dubbed codes both artists have appeared on the label before and are among the most innovative producers linked to new instrumental grime drawing on a range of styles with flair this collaborative ep suppresses their weirder urges however with the exception of whose frantic tom-tom pattern clings tenuously to the grid buffeted by hoover stabs and bits of robotic chatter mostly the pair meet on firmer grime-techno ground though s range is far from narrow it can be expansive and tuneful as on whose sour melody plays out over 8-bit burbles or s whose foggy toplines recall the blue sci-fi moods of legowelt acre and filter dread can do grimey pyrotechnics too particularly on where b-movie melodies ride a cresting tsunami of bass pulses if anything the pairs main problem is an excess of ideas: s six tracks tend to be dense their smog of reverb and layered percussion filling every cranny of the mix a track like has acres fingerprints all over its rolling technoid beat but would have benefitted from a drier treatment the work fares better when the producers use this overload to their advantage as with the noxious psychedelia of
funny thing happened after reviewing the last 1 -inch from (the duo of duane harriott and jorge velez): it remained in my dj bag for months after the edits got deeper and wider with each play ranging from funk to soul disco to house even getting some gospel in there for good measure their latest features three cuts that also range wildly the highlights come often: a cutting up of evelyn champagne king boils with lots of laser stabs while the side feels downright delirious (picadillys blurb suggested use of methamphetamine in its making) youre already knee-deep in the track all breathless panting of high-pitched nasally voices sounding like stevie wonder getting down with kid creoles back-up molls even the curio cover of the beatles my car offers up some sweet fro-disco drum breaks on both sides the looped voices implore and assure: baby i got it lets get funky tonight i know just how you like it and ill make it hot for you and delivers on all of the above promises
in his solo work fuck buttons member benjamin john power takes one element of his bands sound and magnifies it a thousand-fold on his 2011 self-titled debut as he stripped away drums and propulsion to create gigantic cosmic drone-scapes on the very different he has taken fuck buttons rampaging energy turned everything up to 11 and paradoxically created his most accessible music yet is wagnerian blitzkrieg pop a flaming meteor an apocalyptic aftershock a towering wall of sound but where fuck buttons are steeped in the raw distortion of punk rock is processed electronic smoothly stylised this is bracingly noisy music but that noise has been sculpted to excite rather than disturb plus these ludicrously huge tunes are threaded with sweet quirky synth melodies (part 80s electro-pop part classic detroit techno) which gives a vulnerable human dimension the opening one-two of (a bizarre sludge of backwards vocals) and (a storm of thundering drums and gusting noise) is utterly thrilling that initial shock and awe is never quite repeated but and life science whose abrasiveness evolves into a moment of lush beauty come close there is also plenty to enjoy in the more familiar suicide-esque or which is reminiscent of vitalics grand electro indeed for a record inspired by the frailty of the human body carries itself with an engaging confident swagger its slightly ludicrous highly theatrical and great fun
fter a run of remixes by other artists erliners return for the fourth release on their eponymous imprint this pair of tracks have already moved particularly quickly making it into the sets of sven weisemann and the like who himself has already contributed his fair share to the burgeoning project clocking in at a little under nine minutes is billed as an edited version which makes me more than curious to hear the track in its full glory shadowy atmospheric and progressive it resembles a great bird wheeling steadily inwards towards its prey without ever burying its claws the slow rise in tension is like a cruel game while the dubstep-inflected beats skip like a steadily racing heart the percussive work is particularly impressive adding surprisingly soft layers of rhythm and syncopation to crowd in the dub synths and slowly build the compelling pressure is longer still but a slow burner ploughing along workmanlike thanks to its chugging cymbals the light-hearted bass bobbles battle doggedly to lift the gloomy industrial ambience of the slithery metallic echoes until the rugged beat drops in while a little heavy never gets dull as there is always a little change around the bend to keep it interesting
emphasis and experimentation in rhythm and percussion has been an important feature of the recent deep house resurgence and at its best this has given way to genuinely interesting tunes with a tribal-esque groove t its worst though you often get uninspired and dry congas patterns over simple bass lines in mundane attempts at deepness guillaume the coutu dumonts thankfully has stayed on the former side for the most part with his rhythmically-centred house numbers on raum circus company and oslo throughout guillaume who studied percussion in college stated in a recent interview with slices dvd magazine that unsurprisingly for him rhythm is not more or less important than melody or harmonic progression on this oslo release importance is indeed given to the rhythm with tonal percussive elements providing the only sense of melody in two infectiously groovy house numbers my poor french led me to a google translation of the title of this release which reveals it to have something to do with an indian summer oth tracks here have a summery lightness to them with a sound palette that sounds like it might have derived from india or at least somewhere far south of guillaumes former montreal home features a simple two note bass pattern a jews harp riff and a steady bass drum and snare combo around which all manners of percussive hits are woven the groove builds throughout the track as the riff transforms itself in conjunction with the drum hits that effortlessly swirl back and forth over the persistence of the simplistic low-end the track builds up an incredibly catchy groove and its ten-minute duration seems to fly by on identifying the origin of all the rhythmical elements is even trickier but here the melody is provided by what sounds like a clay pot drum and other frican-sounding percussion as shakers swivel around the simple refrain gain these ingredients are layered against the backdrop of a minimal bassline and the track trots along building up a nice and groovy momentum the simple melodies coupled with the evolving and morphing percussion give both tunes an improvisational feel more importantly the melodic aspect breathes some fun into the proceedings and raises them above a lot of contemporary deep house jams which often take themselves too seriously in their attempt to ape their stateside influences

australian producer real name craig mcwhinney runs a label that pushes berghain style techno from afar s output mostly consists of heavy propulsive machine music from mcwhinney and brendon moeller often with remixes by artists who surely serve as inspiration for the labels sound: tripeo ben sims patrik skoog on s sixth release the two regular producers are joined by and berlin based australian for functional purposes these four dark tracks are nothing short of an arsenal each artist operates in a bleak space mostly focused on peak time sounds s is an exception an anxious grind of bells and frayed textures that falls on the new yorkers more unsettling side the rest of features pure if somewhat conventional techno as moellers is a brooding atmospheric track built on intricate percussion groaning pads and a sonar blip that belongs deep in the ocean s is similarly submerged but a tad cleaner with a ricocheting lead sequence that builds into the records most paralyzing high s the closer is a raw techno assault that hammers mean drums through an eruption of scorched hats and noise overall isnt a surprising showcase but all four tracks pack power
the comprise of two danish lads by the names of tim andresen and steen thottrup both have 15 years experience in electronic music and this shows as they deliver a pretty nice release with charlie eddies night out the 2004 version is up first and it really does have a nice flow to it thanks to a smooth warped baseline and some pretty smooth drumwork a spoken vocal runs throughout the track that helps to give it this smooth flow the original mix is a little more uplifting thanks to some pretty subtle melodic pads and another smooth as silk baseline again the track has a pretty smooth flow without going anywhere too adventurous and this is perhaps the key as to why this release is quite good without being outstanding
without a stable of big names to draw the attention of loyalists or much in the way of press burgeoning hamburg imprint has instead built a solid reputation over the last few years with consistently high quality output its split singles sometimes feature producers as eminent as gabriel nanda and lawrence but more often raise the status of erstwhile unknowns such as move d lee jones and nick h ppner from my my ndru efdemin jichael mackson and a host of others their fifteenth and latest release finds deep house producer and prolific radio dj sharing wax real estate with whose micro textured minimal house and techno tunes have garnered the swiss producer a positively swelling reputation here sheds his signature soulful sound for more minimal arrangements while fleshes out the aesthetic hes used so effectively in previous works s is more exacting and restrained than many of his previous productions for labels foreplay or trax of interest retaining a human touch without the full throated divas the tunes patient growth built around a two beat one note melody palpitating throughout the track scores the gestation of its eponymous entity gentle drawn out tones stacked on top of one another and resonating lazily are eventually pushed to the background by agile syncopations swirling counter melodies and stinging pad progressions which make for a crushingly sweet climax on the flipside manages to sound lushly detailed with only a handful of elements thanks to s masterful construction and keen ear for choice timbres setting the tone with soft sixteenth notes trickling through hushed wind like howls gets folks on the floor with its off beat broken chords bounding through the tune and keeps them dancing with a wide angle stuttering melody emerging halfway through s drum programming is just as compelling constantly rearranging itself in subtle ways or dissipating almost entirely at strategic points to spotlight the blushing melodies while gets my nod for the superior track i wouldn t be surprised if i hear both of these fine tunes pouring from the speakers on the same night

its enough to make you want to break out the vicks following in the footsteps of zombys where were u in 92 texan producer matt - mauldin who debuted with all werked up an ep of ravey juke on well rounded individuals last year has now turned his hand to british hardcore and acid house and proves very adept at it despite the frantic pianos bristling breakbeat and air horns the is a contemporary release not some long lost classic theres a sheen to the production and the sub bass is too subtle but who wants slavish recreations its man is a rousing acid burble with a hefty 4/4 kick but its rather overshadowed by which has more than a hint of higher state of consciousness and even a soup on of doug lazy in all its frantic growling tb-303 tweaked glory opening minute of e proves that juke can trace its lineage back to acid rave pitching up a female vocal and manically looping it will never go out of fashion it seems - spends the remainder of the track hopping between juke and hardcore like some aural version of the mov flashback offering compelling evidence that this rave/juke crossover may just have legs
its difficult to review a record like this without lapsing into workmanlike language if you use the word quality or reliable to talk about swiss house then you might as well be praising a table or a chair ut is one of a group of swiss house producers that really is reliable here he drops a two tracker for which feels like a breakthrough release though plenty will have picked up his shtmlaudio and resopal singles nd the result well its quality first up is the sort of exercise in digital house heresy that could only be made in the groove is a sharp mesh of congas and splashing percussion with deep keys and lazy horns loping across a distinctly digital landscape vocal sample of a preacher shouting judgement day and especially raise your black hands high seems an uncomfortable mining pit for a white producer still if you can treat the voice as just another element then that probably wont bother you this is a much more bumpy sound for which sees him stepping closer to the likes of johnny d its also his most ostentatiously big release on the other side is leachin a strange schaffelling deep house track it sounds great with that warm psychedelic daze thats the signature sound for the swiss right now the only problem is the initial schaffel beat which seems kind of pointless and irritating when youve been zombified by house thankfully this disappears leaving a strident and dubby hypnotic house march the final three or four minutes are a triumphant and dogged sequence of repetition a cold winter morning of the mind which will have you slowly drawling the word house once again its difficult to imagine this record (and many that sit next to it in ) ever appealing to anyone beyond the warm safe and self-sustaining bubble that 00s dance music has become but if youre in it its hard to criticise it for that
few would argue that are now one of the most prominent labels in berlin with an unquestionably shrewd ear for r long with dark sky and benjamin damage j remy guindo k is one of the previously lesser-known recruits to the roster no secret was made of modeslektors faith in the young parisian during the promotional campaign for the cobe ep last summer and unsurprisingly his debut album orbiting soon followed four months on guindo returns to with three new productions that showcase the different facets of his broadening sound gets things underway with a heavily filtered soundscape lined with simple pulses and broken claps its rich texture and off-kilter structure should deliver on the floor but judged as a standalone production it feels somewhat rudderless is bumping minimal techno nebulously connected by soft thuds sodden pads and a pinch of gallic jollity meanwhile is a far more immersive piece led by glacial synths and sporadic stabs that make good on the releases stated aim of diversity
this is pete tong and sarah main: the sequel last year the twosome went to pacha and returned with a solid pair of mixes that were most notable for the introduction of main to the art of the dj compilation taking her chance with both hands she eclipsed tong with a great party set of chunky house funky round the edges here the balance gets redressed somewhat but it s safe to say sarah main has consolidated her craft over the last year a cool start breaks the listener in gently with booka shade s subtle in white rooms and though the early tracks take a while to hang together once she s into her stride main shows willingness to change direction and include different strains of house music sure there s a bit of a judder between kirk degiorgio s starwaves and richard grey s come into my life but in a sense that s reassuring human intervention rather than computer precision highlights include the obvious loleatta holloway s love sensation in dead stereo guise but also the more subtle swinger s delight with dj mas and paul cari s funky house number including a bassline that cuts through the speakers nicely meanwhile pete tong s mix is excellent and he seems more at home when free to choose what he wants rather than when his agenda is a commercial one sure there are a couple of big hitters here tiefschwarz and julien jabre add an emotive edge to the opening section while fedde le grand s mighty put your hands up for detroit signals a change of direction through the middle but while these have all made the transition above ground it s the depth and continuity of his set that impresses here from warmly balearic beginnings the mix moves to take electro as its base with strong material from kurd maverick and the ever-present booka shade before returning to warmer climbs at the finish tong shades it then but in truth both mixes press the right buttons and complement each other nicely a decent guide to where it s been at in pacha this summer
when saw play at rghain earlier this year half the people that knew there thought it was pretty much the best thing ever half thought it was the worst but as far as could tell it was the same set that he always plays s the mainstream comes closer to and goes closer to the mainstream youll have that is an almost perfect encapsulation this idea: cant help but admire the quality productions but just as ten you find yourself wincing at what that does to the quality the music rules have changed track two on s debut album four years ago was midnight request line track two on is a collaboration with a vegan merican rapper hes suffered writers block nearly topped the uk charts and formed a supergroup s a result hes put together an album that splits the difference between pop and underground and in the end likely wont please anyone completely like any good modern album its ripe with singles for the taking: is a slow jam for mosh pits is a buffed and waxed take on squarepushers red hot car is just the sort emo youd expect from a collaboration with dewy-eyed drum bassers nstra:mental and d-bridge but like any good modern album its got some tracks thatll make you think twice about hitting the buy all button aforementioned track two sounds wonderful like a modern update still d r e but has rapping about how wonderful it all is featuring is nothing more than corporate synergy gone wrong is a palate-cleansing b-side at best perhaps the most striking thing about is how relentlessly melancholy it is aside theres nothing that wibbles all that much the known for rinsing crowds to within an inch their sanity this is presenting himself as a serious artist nd a pop artist nd an underground artist too has something for everyone which is exactly why it doesnt quite work as an album
whoevers behind the new label knows a thing or two about funk there was plenty of it on the first siren the swinging ancient methods ep that launched the label earlier this year back ten months later with lays down another four deliciously cool techno tracks that dont let industrial grit get in the way of a good groove (thats a reference to not the berlin burrito spot) has the kind of snaking electroclash style melody you hear in ancient methods dj sets and wonder where did he find this its strapped to a drum pattern that builds from a syncopated halftime mess to a slamming 4/4 chug but the brief intro which offers a few bars of a straight beat gives nimble djs something to work with its the kind of ebm techno blend that ancient methods pushes so dont be surprised if the new aliases here and are the berliner in disguise is another funked up bomb with a groove that doesnt match the macabre title without much deviation from a straightforward technoid pulse its the eps most linear tune ticking along at an easygoing 116 bpm with shrieks and cackles and increase the pressure with feedback and tough drums theres less focus on rhythm which means they dont reach the funky highs of the other tunes even so theyre bound to heat up the sets of djs unafraid to add dirt into the mix
so who exactly is ob ignitt nd where was part 1 of this release while these are perfectly reasonable questions to ask when presented with cops [sic] (part 2) the latest from -s and his mysterious co-producer it feels a bit silly digging into the minutiae of a release that asks so little of us in return like heres your trance now dance lex o smiths smash from last year cops doesnt concern itself with too much other than getting your feet moving to be certain -s has once again tapped into trance s winning formula: both the raw original mix and the slightly more delicate s mix on the flip (emphasis on slightly ) feature a shimmering electro melody absolutely befitting the appropriated everly s cop poster art on the label its the sort of vintage synth line that honestly couldnt get any catchier backed up by equally hummable bass and drum programming perfectly calibrated to get you stepping just so smith and ignitt (whoever he may be and whatever role he may have fulfilled here given the supreme -s-ness of the proceedings) have given us two sides of dance music that are nearly impossible to argue with s one of those aforementioned fanboys though i do wonder if well ever see smith release a single as nuanced and ambitious as psychotic photosynthesis which wasnt exactly short on mania-inducing qualities ut in the heat of the moment as that buzzy synth starts to percolate any quibble you might have is likely to be pretty far from your mind

sensual is the perfect way to describe this album of futuristic tech house beats as steve delves into sexy house territories with fat thumping beats singable melodies and keeping it funky enough to dance to or chill out to steve represents with the harder edged tech house tunes on tracks like that kid pleasure park and a spy-themed criminal investigation - definitely one to hear on this album on the dancier funkier side of things shake the funk mixed up moods and all i need with the lovely female vocals provided by virginia go into a bit of electro styled beats - funky enough to shake what yo mama gave ya steve gets things all chilled and mellow with a down tempo bug maniac and purple brain for those sombre moments on top of it all theres an interlude called food in australia where steve shows us how much he loves our country and especially the food here for those of you getting tired of funky and or banging house and would like something they can put a little more thought into try it might just be the medicine you need
built around a light installation she designed herself s live shows are a glistening tour de force the flipside is that the turkish-born artists music always has to work that little bit harder to keep up theres nothing fundamentally lacking on kurtels first release for the best part of 18 months it just lacks much of the verve and energy of her twinkling leds atmospheric yes unfailing so but melody is all but forsaken cowering in the corner while the bassline lopes across its path interrupted by trippy pulses and smears of indecipherable vocal offer suitably languid support on a breathy winsome female vocal it could easily have been culled from a late 90s sasha track wraps itself around a lethargic bassline and a sprinkling of proggy arps much like the lead track it falls between two stools neither overwhelming you with ebullience nor taking you somewhere dark a place where something interesting might happen
like many of his peers the 19-year-old producer from suffolk has a foot in two camps year ago he was making dubstep a style that also loosely describes his single roomland from just last month ut this years trilogy of eps for is deep house full stop read gets tagged as bass music but his records show how arbitrary that term can be when it can so easily encompass theo parrish/moodymann homages thats not a complaint about reads work by the way ping detroits deepest is a widespread phenomenon and far lesser talents than read have tried to follow in their footsteps one of the things that he brings to the table is murk thats true across all three eps which wrap their drum machines in warbly vocals and dirty filters until everything but the hi-hats are hazy ll takes the soot-stirring to a new extreme with a growling acoustic bass and muted piano chords beneath a hiss of cymbals; the lead vocal though gives the song a soulful sense of focus a tumbles like a muddy agate with a ronny jordan-like guitar lick suffused in indistinct buzz and an unsettling vocal loop that sounds like a pitched-down ntony here the drums carry everything forward with a particularly visceral snare/clap sound cutting like a beacon through the fog
the debut release from melbournes we know what youre up to shows us what theyve been up to of late and what has been influencing them production wise all genres of house - banging progressive funky garage and incorporating a little bit of breaks and electro in the mix as well the first track to be someone is a banging house tune introduced by a solo guitar before ripping into the house beats with james ashs vocals on top i didnt really get into their cover of inxs need you tonight renamed here into one of my kind when they released it as a single however it seems to fit quite well into the overall track flow of the album so it makes a bit of sense looking at things in the big picture as well overload moves into 80s electro/electroclash along the lines of le rhythmes digitale with melinda on vocals who also appeared on their tight debut single give in to me which thnkfully gets included into the album as well highly danceable and has a little bit of mainstream appeal make it better features the ragga vocals of mc rudeboy on top of a funky ragga house number similar to basement jaxx rudeboy then appears alongside mc bobby mileage on the part punk part uk garage and probably the highlight tune of the album revolution - anyone whos heard what the audio bullys are doing (mixing up punk house garage hip hop breakbeat etc) will get into this james ash showcases his vocal talents again on stay a slighty more tripped out house tune with excessive use of the vocoder on broken he sings alongside melinda on top of a very rapid and stomping tech beat with even more use computer generated vocals finally he appears on the finale - lift this planet - an uplifting piano laden tune featuring the words of maurice white from 70s/80s disco group earth wind fire reminiscent of jon cutler e-mans its yours after showing us what she can do on give in to me singer melinda richards shows us that shes got vocal talent and also appears on the deep housey golden and the downtempo acid jazz groove of take it deeper - on a similar tip to young disciples incognito and brand new heavies overall this is a enjoyable album and easy to listen to - it has mainstream appeal to it nevertheless it was enough to grab my attention - a hardened breakbeat freak - to sit up and have a good listen
in the mans own words s second album is psych-prog rock made on computers that statement could incite all manner of reactions its certainly not a usual approach but cowan real name adam taylor has never really fit in with his uk peers when they were doing the bass music thing he was making wriggly tech house with a rainbow finish 2011s circa was thick as a brick an explosion of exaggerated colours and sharp left turns with his return to he doesnt turn down the brightness much but he does trim some of the fat to his credit taylors description of the album isnt totally off each track is carefully constructed and has a newfound sense of direction re are still left turns but theyre more intuitive and the mood shifts are more climactic (like the hallucinogenic explosion in the midsection of ) each song feeds into the next starting with the cartoonish which morphs into the buoyant basslines of by the time the album reaches its centrepiece a two-track movement sixes and the music is as dense and virtuosic as any 70s prog rock album your own experience with depends on how well you handle excess supremely artificial sound palette chirpy bleeps splotches of wet synth means that can slip into a bland sugar rush if youre not paying close attention but it also contributes to the albums distinct light-heartedness a delight after the sprawl of cowans previous work echoing the dense compositional wizardry of bands like yes and emerson lake palmer takes a combination of patience and good humour to understand and enjoy if youve got that its a wild ride
while may be best known for a remix on semantica in 2010 these days the focus is on their own imprint which enters its second year of operation with the second vinyl ep and fourth overall release the duos original tracks and the digital bonus take a few minutes to reveal themselves but the patient listener is rewarded with gorgeous synth work in the later sections of each track my favorite of those three is whose lean acid lines and dramatic melodies conjure up cinematic chase-scene imagery handling remix duties are berlins ancient and afs fellow spaniard oscar both of whom head out on predictable but nonetheless interesting tangents ancient tosses a bunch of low-end sludge and detuned trebly anxiety into two signature moves from that duo which are further emphasized in a slower extended digital version in contrast s syncopated take on blows up to near-anthem proportions it rounds out an ep whose variety and depth provide a refreshing counterpoint to the monochromatic sounds that course heavily through todays techno landscape

red rackems appearance on ramp shouldnt come as a huge surprise the label has long been a reliable source for refreshing outsider takes on whatever the uk happens to be preoccupied with at the time which has lately meant slightly sinister rhythmically unstable house music this single two cuts of eyes-down house with just a hint of rudeness ploughs a furrow familiar to those whove been following the red rackem releases on ermans own ergerac imprint since 2010 but manages to sound utterly in tune with the concerns of the uk-centric dance floor in is all crisp tribal percussion and gut-quaking sub: not a particularly attractive sound but an effective one nonetheless its easy to imagine this being dropped in at the druggier end of a uk funky set the furtive harp-like pads are deeply ambiguous in tone though and towards the end tiny chunks of field recording start to appear seemingly intended to destabilise rather than cohere ll lone meanwhile draws on much the same sound palette as if only the past released on ergerac earlier this year though thats not to its detriment uilt around a weighty dub bassline and heel-dragging hi-hat shuffle the whole thing quickly descends into 5 m paranoia territory whats most striking though is ermans ability to string things out were taken through several sets of harmonic material over its six-and-a-half minute length and the more patient listener is rewarded with a snare drum in the closing 90 seconds theres admirably little flab here making for a single as appealing to the armchair connoisseur as it likely is on the dance floor
one of those great little oases of techno in london line up four tracks that cut across the genre to mark their 20th birthday hypercolour co owner yanks you straight into the swollen 3 am melee of a darkened warehouse with a heads down jam with jacking detroit signifiers a submarine deep bass thump then h s over his own to fellow yorkshireman you ewan with a taut woody metronomic click as its backbone ewan smith takes it down the basic channel route; its dub techno spliced to a murky reggae bassline with itchy synth blips percussive tics scuttling over it like roaches kris wadsworths reworking of s is twisted techno of the head nodding late night shuffle variety with wobbling bass nagging synth digs its rounded off by s own of a sprawling trippy groove with jagged echo laden keys
quantum natives an abstruse net-label run by two art school-educated londoners has got some unexpected shine this year both founders have had relatively high-profile releases: brood ma on tri ngle (with daze ) and on speaking to wire last year brood ma described the pairs knotty music as subvert[ing] the idea of world building ir imagined landscapes dont submit to the orderly hand of their creator; they roil and seethe and disintegrate confusing the listener at every turn in brood mas music the results are hellish and intense s world is calmer is sprinkled with sci-fi references ( fifth element on david lynchs dune on ) but its more like a fantasy world quaint and strange and unexpectedly dark spidery string loop in sounds like the ambience of a tavern scene in a final fantasy game until the whole thing starts to melt as if the cd is frazzling in the console tray elsewhere tiny electronic sounds swirl and eddy in attractive patterns creating the sense of bustling but unknowable life its often fairly difficult to pick out a musical narrative; better to think of each track as an environment to step into first half of is almost provocative in its subtleness is pretty at first but soon wanders into a maze of chuntering electronics as if were lost in the dusty halls of an ancient factory complex whose title suggests arcane farming machinery muffled drums and bass guitar thud dolorously behind a scree of scrapes and rattles and are decaying landscapes seen in half-light indistinct and threatening each track requires an effort of imagination from the listener to really bring it to life just as that requirement is starting to seem too much offers a few bolder gestures in c and elegant synth melodies are a gossamer thread through the squeaky confusion closer is almost euphoric its processed voices pulsing and swirling like an alien choir s indeterminate worlds are often beguiling but its this moment when he sets his hand more firmly on the rudder that sticks in the memory
does ever blow it if they do its not very often its tough to think of another label that has been so satisfyingly consistent over the last few years even the few and far between throwaway tracks the so-called dj tools seem to cause a stir res nothing throwaway about the latest single from starts off innocent enough as it rides in on drums snaps and syncopated bass but things turn sinister as dubby stabs and an industrial synth line creep into the low-end this is paranoid ground ring in some hallucinatory siren rhythms drop a sample of a rastafarian talking about birds and trees rev up the synth line and youve hit pay dirt s no newcomer to the world of production (on eatport alone his name is attached to some 72 releases) but his three singles on find him really hitting his stride and it partly seems to be a result of his taking a page or two from the radio slave playbook ecgd u skin and all strive for that propulsive overwhelming intensity that light up so many of matt edwards more anthemic cuts so while on the -side mr g nods to radio slave its fitting that on the flip radio slave nods elsewhere itd be a mistake to call radio slaves the remix of dubstep in any form but its also impossible to listen to without hearing nods to the tribal percussive sound of shackleton and the dub-techno of 2562 martyn et al its also impossible to listen to without shaking drawing from the ominous pulse of the original the remix churns and pounds and heaves without ever indulging in relief tropical birdcall samples go from serene to unnerving bird songs to bird screams this isnt the lue lagoon this is pocalypse w and its fantastic
fter some pressing plant delays the new single finally hits the stores in glorious white 10-inch vinyl if youre lucky enough to get the numbered special edition that is ut dont let the aesthetics distract you from the quality music inside: oth sven weisemann and marko f rstenberg apply some serious atmospheric pressure to the dubbed out original with stunning results weisemann is up first and lets his short range mix stroll elegantly and at length over the never ending heartbeat throb of the bass less caf house and percussively embellished than some of his previous works weisemann almost sounds like the medium for the music to pass through here rather than its strict master the pace is wonderfully light and persistent while the mood sustains its subtle colour and bright revelations the breakdown in the middle is paramount letting in a head rush of oxygen and brimming night slowly the flow is released again into a gentle current of synth pads scratchy percussion and drifting tides which simply ebb gently away without ever peaking marko f rstenbergs mix is also full of broad changes but is somewhat faster flowing opening like an early pole track it quickly digs deeper into the rhythm section while adding a castigating whip-like percussion the sound is at first overtly mechanistic but the illusion is soon broken as hot dub jets and tiny unpredictable percussive volcanoes erupt everywhere to add a compelling flow the accumulation of subtle details is spectacular but only when the hand claps drop in and the whole track turns on its head into a darkly seductive house number does it become clear just how well made it is sublime and moody
with names like sunshine and moonbeam youd think that were way up in the clouds with the hippies well not quite although is a suitably spaced out album to get horizontal to or a record to turn to when youre after a bit of chilled deep house y save the best til last with the pulsing pianos of their biggest anthem on here but theres other cool soundscapes such as and raggatronique where the dub flavourings come to the fore despite the dodgy title vocals are sweetly sung by chantal who occasionally gets a tad piercing if youre listening on headphones and lyrics tend to be a cut above your average deep house fodder occasionally things become over sentimentalised as in but the picture is mostly cool keyboards deep beats and warm funky bass hooks the tap insistently at the part of your brain that remembers such tunes a good record to massage a hangover with
the eastern seaboard consistently produces some of the most demure deep house around this stuff doesnt come much more pleasantly blunted than the first release on sound warrior the imprint is a new collaboration between and a forum for developing and promoting women electronic music producers s is the more active number with a busy bassline adding some low end panache to its drifting cloud chord progression strategic snares and woodblocks add a slight snap without disturbing the overall peace dakini 9s is even more luxurious though it has the more decisive low end its simple straight ahead thump is cushioned by high pitched wails a sustained chord and strange time stretch artifacts reminiscent of sedate 90s idm its hard to imagine having a negative thought while these tracks are playing
whats in the water over in hamburg for nearly a decade now the dial label has been crafting deeply emotional house music and over the past two years the diynamic label has emerged as one of the most interesting up-and-coming imprints around plenty of the credit for diynamics rise of course goes to mladen whose feuer eis collaboration with stimming last year propelled the label to prominence but while has been involved in the majority of diynamics releases thus far hes never been one to shy away from lending his talents to other labels fter stellar work for liebe*detail sonar kollektiv and dessous the ep marks his first entry into the four:twenty catalogue like everything hes done of late its a keeper is a straight-up anthem wrapping its hypnotic strings over a house bounce riff first taken up by a synth is soon repeated by the strings giving the whole thing enough weight to validate its deep house status peak-time stormer and the mines s croatian heritage for its vocal in much the same way that stefan goldmann did for bulgaria on last years lunatic fringe this time though the focus isnt on avant theatrics; instead the chorus slots neatly into a conga-led groove its a bit slower than most but speed it up a bit and youve got yourself another anthem if 2007 was the year that arrived is already looking like a lot like the year he becomes a star
you know it took me three months after the initial release of the original version of s girls can be cruel to understand its potential and power inside the clubs few understood my position as to why i didn t get it sooner than i did well once i understand what everyone else was raving about i was sadly three months late but i didn t care; good music is good music so after a year licenses some remixes from the italian label mantra vibes with additional remixes from king unique for a special two-pack remix package everyone by now has heard kus massive remix but how many of you have heard the dub well king unique s danger dub goes off in a different direction than the remix working with mainly the danger vocal sample the boys conjure up a beefy house number that hopes to get the crowed jumping around all night long the groove isn t has funky or lovable here but for those who enjoys their house music with more meat while sparing the vocals only when needed this looks to fit the bill flip it around and you find a loud-mouth-booty-romping-remix courtesy of alex the psiko garden dolby his psiko girls can be cruel in the garden mix is among the most head turner remixes on the market and it ll show once you lay it out on the dance floor superhuman bass kicks that s all it takes to build this monster seconds past turning to minutes and it just keeps building until you hear dolby s signature horns blowing in a bit anti-climatic in the middle as you would have assumed a rush of anthematic beats but it never appears as he doesn t allow it to set off to orbit the first disc of the remix package has something to offer for those who want to rock out the party in a bang but will find that boom not ready or realized as they may have hoped for
is a label obsessed with the dark sides of art music and humanity its a tendency thats gotten the london imprint in hot water particularly when a questionable tweet about stalking a woman led others to highlight s equally dicey imagery on facebook that taste in violent gruesome visuals also bleeds into the labels sleeve artwork one artist who pushes against s dour aesthetic is k jacob martin his openly goofy personality seems like the furthest thing from the labels approach martins second 12-inch for the label is in turn unusually affirmative from the title to the colourful artwork and the music itself the stormer that takes up the -side is in scorched earth mode: sinister strings are bolstered by a blown-out drum sample all bathed in stadium-ready reverb the title track sounds like bottled sunshine in comparison its a smooth detroit roller in the vein of juan tkins or galaxy 2 galaxy cushioned by a pillowy bassline choral pads and vintage synth strings finishing off the ep is something in between stern techno with a soft edge theres a melody that sounds vaguely like a flute and the reese basslines gently curve downwards instead of rushing things ahead for many the controversy surrounding the label will define it from here on out while others are keen to move on or defend its decisions (tying themselves into knots arguing the right to offend ) but one thing that hasnt changed amidst the scrutiny of the labels visual style is the music that underpins it s shows its as undeniable as ever
a year when experimental techno continued its foray into the increasingly blurry realms of dub ambient and good old fashioned retrospective rawness has been hard at work consolidating a reputation as one of the industrys most promising boundary-nudging stalwarts using the mojuba imprint in conjunction with sister labels a r t less and to mark out separate sonic arenas the young producer has never been shy about flirting with different manifestations of the sublime after a r t less shove tested his signature warm dub techno formula against moments of alternately cold stark percussion and beatless murmur back in may zero more recently justified s role as an experimental deep house stable adding a new richness to his club-friendly offerings on mojuba marrying epic string arrangements and gentle piano with a low-slung pulse and vocal mumble zero signalled the young berliners next move reclining in the moments between his hectic dj schedule to embrace his love for modern classical ambience given the exploratory nature of weisemanns work its not surprising to find his first full-length release catalogued as the labels first voyage contrast to previous singles (filed instead as journeys ) is as promised a far-reaching and ambitious ambient excursion into the soundscaped world of the classical composers he eagerly name-checked to ra as influences boldly nailing his colours to the wall by presenting the special edition in an embossed blue notebook that references max richters masterpiece the finished product is appropriately lush and keeps with mojubas insistence that their releases embrace visual art and music synonymously here the presentation supplements his intended imaginary film score the cover appearing as a sort of stage curtain ready to majestically unveil the drama within the music opens to a gentle beat workout accompanied by a nicely padded electronic ambience a spaciousness which goes on to underlie the rest of the albums narrative controlled pressure has long been weisemanns strength but the twenty short pieces instead place his piano and cello skills at centre stage dispersing minimal refrains and immaculately placed exchanges amongst sparse airy percussion weisemann has a great appreciation for subtle melody adding to the pervasive sense of personalised melancholy that draws the listener deep into an unrelenting reverie fact the changes across the complete soundscape are so slight that it becomes hard to position either as something for focused listening or ambient background material and in both cases the narrative intention is lost without any clear sense of direction or variety guiding the listener to tangible points of closure this is a record likely to reward and test your patience in equal measure despite the prevailing sense of flatline melancholy the storys most obvious drama occurs during i - of whose vocals literally howl at a sense of tragic loss elsewhere s minimalist piano swells to a beautifully hopeful climax and the watery bass tones of and i both evoke a sense of pulsating organic life is most successful where the electronic framework is a little more invasive and the live instruments rub against its electronic supports suggesting wesiemann might have the most to offer the classical world when drawing more directly on his experience in techno despite these shortcomings still stands as a strong personal statement by one of todays most unflinchingly explorative and versatile producers
so much for expectations knowing that tom neville was once responsible for a release called just f**k and put together a mixmag cover mount cd entitled electro house the sound of summer 2006 will do little to prepare you for the deliciously weird 12-inch on offer here neville has made his name remixing for the likes of the verve and ritney spears nd while you can hear the subtle echoes of electro bleeps epic builds and moments of trance he relentlessly cuts them off at the pass on neville builds a nice little riff thatll be old hat to anyone thats listened to dance music for the past say decade ut instead of hammering it into the ground he fades it out and replaces it with henry ennett singing a counter melody over in the corner its equally as catchy doo do doooo has that effect on you at times but its a subtle left turn that cools the song down instead of heating it up as you might expect him to the same goes for which is the classic build build build uild and nothing really neville just fades things out time after time its a supreme bit of self-control from a guy that youd think wouldnt have much nd it works wonders the hooks are still around but without someone to pound them into your brain with a hammer they last longer and theyre far more pleasurable to have around for long periods of time if the sound palette of the sound of summer 2006 does your head in you wont have much to look forward to here ut with an open mind and an open cd booklet these tunes are remarkably strange and effective little things
like many big labels these days saw are also trying to mix things up with their release schedule and the latest release from missy zeze presslaboys is no different e f x (european fusion experience) is the name of the release and it shows a more techy side to the saw label the electro monkey mix gets the ball rolling with some chunky beats from the word go the base rumbles soon take over as the track pounds the speakers early on and builds in its early stages the track then leads to the first break in beat which sees a screechy electro synth pattern take control as subtle squeaks and bleep ring in the background the production takes a straight path with out any real peaks but it works quite well the original mix is clearly not as tough as the electro mix from the word go the original has a funky edge to it with the baseline and smooth effects that feature throughout the electro synths are not as strong in this mix as they feature throughout but are clearly not the focal point of the track unlike the mix on the flip it s a good mix the compliments the electro mix on the flip and is for those that didn t like the raw edge the elector mix provided a pretty solid release for saw and it demonstrates their focus on changing things up and playing with diversity whether or not this has worked on this instance is up for you to decide
only ten minutes this long player sounds like the aural accompaniment to some space age love affair: whispered voices disparate hooks beautiful melodies little later on and your ears are transported to a small village in the spanish mountains mid-festival could easily call the contents herewith downbeat though that would miss the point re are beats the tempo is down but it would be more apt to describe as an international soundtrack equal parts experimental and traditionalist one minute everythings going the way of bjork working with howie b and a bag of opium the next were sitting around a campfire listening to u chao succeeds because taking the journey from its dubbiest depths to the farthest latin edges is so enjoyable lbums labeled as eclectic or global can often suffer from over conceptualisation too often not enough thought has been afforded to accessibility not so here as the notion of listening pleasure appears to have been paramount in the production process take the oddly titled for a which combines muted organs intricate jazz pianos and santana-style guitar solos with a hallucinatory fairground waltz ts not all challenging though take a listen to the beautifully plucked strings that cascade over complete with ethereal vocals here given a touch of coco rosian shrill lunacy elsewhere fans of poltergeist and post-rave distorted vocals may find a lot to love in naudible euphoria-tinged distant and otherworldly lyrics carry across a soundscape of reversed cymbals and plodding pianos while airy-fairy atmospherics do feature heavily on most of the ten tracks really thats only part of the story res plenty of late night partying whiskey in hand to be done to any of the tunes here that said it would be more appropriate if such sessions took place in an exotic palm-lined locale or perhaps at sea or well n short there are few words capable of accurately summarising this varied collection
even taking a broad view of what house and techno can constitute youd be hard pushed to label s latest as either style its barely dance music is an eight-minute patchwork of stuttering synth stabs and barely-there kick drums lashed together but lacking in forward momentum this extremely limited palette is a far cry from his sample-heavy noi no album for s hko but does a surprising amount with limited tools has little groove to speak of though one does occasionally surface and then arbitrarily disappear focus is not on movement but the materiality of the sounds themselves: the artificial clucking of synths; the stop-start motion as the track hauls itself into a groove before going off-kilter; the occasional clap thrown in like a treat is more identifiably dance music though its techno slowed to a sluggish pace which only magnifies its sparseness it has a trebly drone a thin stab a bassline that never coalesces into a groove and a vocal sample low in the mix despite the paucity of its elements hiding contains very little space so the parts swirl together claustrophobically it feels heated and oppressive and not so different from the high-pressure hardware jams on laurel halos recent chance of rain is the biggest curveball of all a mucky eight-minute piece of sunn o)))-inspired drones vinyl pops and feedback
when it was announced last year that radford had been tapped for a rinse mix it felt like a watershed moment: the first straight up house turn in the series since then house and techno have become increasingly common on rinse but its still hard not to feel surprised by their next choice creations associate who doesnt have radfords connections to pirate radio following an especially eclectic mix from kode9 s contribution signals a new chapter in the rinse story with the radio station reaching outside its cast of residents as a result rinse 23 doesnt really feel like a rinse cd series has taken in grime dubstep funky garage and everything in between through the years but flirtations with house have always been taken hand in hand with uk centric music ( ben ufo kode9) or simply packed with good old london bassweight ( radford ) not so here s mix is closely aligned with the creations empire making few deviations from that labels template for passably catchy house has fine taste in poppier fare from s to the jackson samples of kurnis but his set rolls along with little pizzazz to perk up your ears coming from a different background s smooth and seamless mixing style also feels incongruous for the series t might suit his record collection but rinse 23 carries the nagging feeling that this is the kind of session you could get anywhere completely removed from the labels scene defining pedigree a capable dj by anyones measure s venture into the rinse world is certainly competent but it isnt much more

didnt establish himself as a force in electronic music by doing things the standard way: his own productions and those found on his label rarely sound like theyre coming from the same universe as practically everything else on the shelves thats certainly the case on the dem ep goldmanns and s latest: neither his weirdest nor heaviest record its nonetheless the kind of ticklish release that can tie a dj set into the best sort of musical knots dem takes its melody from chalga a sort of winding bulgarian folk/pop/dance style and it provides goldmann with just the sort of closely placed notes and resulting sweet dissonances he likes ( melody-isolating heads off the b-side ) the beats however wiry precision-cut daggers of drums are goldmanns own tech house fans have heard plenty of eastern european sounds woven into these sorts of rhythms over the years but dem doesnt feel like a cut-and-paste job: each serves to amplify the bounce of the other goes quite a way with just bass a few drum samples quiet pads and a hyperactive delay unit settles into a kind of grim post-industrial space a bit of a weird landing pad for an ep that begins with such bounce but rarely plays to any expectations other than well just that
proves once again that s reputation for being dry academic and inaccessible is thoroughly undeserved bretschneider s latest demonstrates that exploiting reduction as a technique does not by definition exclude funk and richness from the vocabulary using an incredible economy of means bretschneider has created a powerful album that taps in to the deep dub that has always been present (and all the more powerful for being in the shadows) on as well as the power of big breathing bass that bretschneider would come out with such an organically funky album will be no surprise to those familiar with his output one of the most melodic producers in the stable he was responsible for gold the most blatantly pop album on the label so far on the track titles double as a reading list of classic mid-century sci-fi compounding the impression that these stripped bare constructions are vaguely threatening in their sparseness but while the titles might evoke androids or the soullessness of an oppressive state the sound of the record makes it clear that bretschneider is on a different tack opener of is a deep dive into dub territory while (phillip k dick) sets atmospheric and disarmingly sharp binaries against inimitable bretschneider funk nd while the slow dub and counter-rhythms of a track like ll in a (ray bradbury) have something distinctly alien about them the album doesn t create a soulless synthetic sound world but a fallible complex human one that evokes the best in science fiction human side of the record is revealed not just in the organic percussiveness but in the weaker links such as on and (ray bradbury) where the prickly rhythms fail to engage as thoroughly as on other tracks but regardless of the references it s the dominating power of the bass on tracks like the s hk -esque that shine most brightly on the album making it an essential listen not only for fans of sparser sounds but also to devotees of the huge bass constructions in dub-step-techno or dj pete and dettmann s heavy beats at berghain
dubstep album is a difficult thing; its no coincidence that the best are only tangentially related to the genre burials albums were spooky garage 2562s unbalance unstable techno kode9s memories of the future steeped in dub guidos anidea leaning towards grime and poppy songcraft you get the picture frankly dubsteps dank and meditative vibes are not really album fare edges and borders bleed between six minute chunks of moody dread and the experience can easily become an hour of plodding monochrome leeds producer s debut is a good dubstep album though and it doesnt even have to step very far outside of dubstep to accomplish this is dubstep through-and-through its bleak greyness silhouetting a stunning journey rather than a muddled mess refers to a circadian rhythm the roughly twenty-four-hour cycle assumed by living things and the album indeed has somewhat of a progressive arc though its more likely to invoke the idea of a story rather than properly weave a tale s success is twofold; one his music feeds on its own endless tension sparrow makes dark brooding tracks removed from contemporaries who use wobbling or snaking lfo bass for release instead sparrow lets off steam through his intricately layered percussion as well as occasional brief outbursts (the moment of erupting breaks on is particularly breathtaking) rarely looking up from his heads-down stance secondly immersion; his world might not be immediately accessible but its gaping chasm is easy enough to fall into lacks mid-range consisting mostly of drums and miles-underground sub-bass it draws the listener in becoming the forced center of gravity: the drums dont merely pound and clink they surround enchant and conjure and conjure they do; is the voyeuristic view of someones subconscious wrestling with personal demons a journey through a frightening dreamscape where the only comfort lies in knowing that theyre not your own dreams gentle bassline of induces sleep and the bottom drops off completely with the guttural tribalisms of and culminating in the gurgling ugliness of and albums most arresting moments come at its end where the vision turns from hazily hallucinogenic to fantastical; and are excursions into some mutant form of drum bass reaching obscenely high bpms as they practically lift off the ground journey ends in motionless suspension with a title which suggests escape but delivers nothing but excruciating purgatory this cliffhanger ending might not quite complete the albums circadian rhythm cycle though its hard to fault sparrow when hes achieved something so remarkable: a dubstep album that doesnt compromise uses its bleak greyscale to explore new levels of reduced brilliance dubstep album is a difficult thing but apparently not for

last time that guillaume coutu dumont appeared on the karat label was with julien roy as egg back in 2005 now that hes become a prolific and lauded producer in his own right theyve snapped him back up to deliver a solo twelve is based around a repeated vocal loop and bumpin housey percussion and even though the track clocks in at over ten minutes guillaumes rhythmic and melodic flourishes make sure that the vibe never gets stale its one of his more uplifting tracks and it possesses a relentless groove that should work well on both house and techno floors tracks on the flipside are a little less peaktime but are still very playable things get a little more jazzy and complex on where guillaume throws some steel drums some light keys and a rhythmic guitar line into the mix mood gets elevated into a summery carnival style once the parping horns emerge accompanied by the reprise of the steel drum line and its sure to get some play during afternoon sets over the coming months by djs that are trying to lock in to a tropical vibe is much more low key than the other two efforts as organic polyrhythms intertwine over a bouncing bassline and vocal loop listen carefully and you can even make out a subdued harmonica line appear halfway through before the stabbing keys reappear to reinforce the groove djs who found his les petit djinns 12-inch a little jazzy for their liking will be sure to enjoy this one a lot more if youve been searching for a record to inject a bit of sunshine into your dancefloor look no further

stuttgart s who also goes by arguably the worst moniker in all of dance music (dj all-star) makes his debut on ben watt s buzzin fly imprint with the double a-side and the same vein as other recent s this ep stays on the whole deep-minimal-trance tip but these tracks don t really pack as much punch as previous releases of is reminiscent of late nineties epic trance and could easily be mistaken for a bonzai label issue a simple trance riff repetitively drones on before an adequate bassline shuffles it into dancefloor territory unfortunately shuffle and drone is all it does the same goes for the b-side too it s warm it s deep it s boring it s throbbing bassline sounds promising to begin with but the simplistic twinkling melodies just keep looping without doing much else it s the repetition and for want of a better word lack of progression that really lets this release down with so much of this type of sound being produced these days there s bound to be some overkill maier tries for some originality by taking it really deep but the end result seems plodding a surprising dip in the usually reliable quality of buzzin fly
are an interesting case for the creeping influence of electronic music montreal duos last few releases of wispy folk-pop featured synthesizers but they still felt like window dressing music that was rooted in other traditions not anymore agor and raph have discovered dance music and crafted a bewitching album of sparse pop that incorporates its textures and timbres rather than trying imitate the music itself two apparently wrote much of the album separately which explains why often feels like agor is attacking raphs delicate songs with electronics or as if shes asserting her presence over his undergrowth of artificial sounds disparate process arguably adds the albums cohesion; one gets the sense that each partner was hesitant go o far with their additions result is a record thats sensually stark with not one extraneous moment marking its naked con urs albums most dominant element is silence tween raphs voice and agors subtle electronics every dolorous sound is clear and sharp-edged opener folow is an impressionistic array of transient sounds and vocals held in place by flat slabs of bass its conclusion also reveals s strongest attribute: looped wordless vocals creating brand new melodies its a tactic borrowed from bass music and reused here surprisingly good effect some of the albums best moments come when up the dance ante stunning suite is dizzy and diffuse in its throbbing second movement raph defiantly climbs a p the seasick crush of voices commanding silence as she sings it doesnt hurt it only makes me sicker/and we wiser/an end us its simple but piercing revealing an unsettling lyrical undercurrent for those who can pick out concrete words amongst the artificial stutters as its title would suggest concerns itself with a dried-up relationship handling the subject with approachable honesty the duo run the gamut from breakup songs oth which describes the virtues of making love someone you know truly well might just be the groups best ruminating on identity disappointment and independence its also the records most organic track following the heavily manipulated opener a palate cleanser of acoustic guitar and voice bathed in luxurious reverb the verses raph sings against a fleeting chorus of her own voices before gently soaring solo and then crash-landing right back in the thicket of gasping sighs its beautiful and confusing impossible tell if her earthy nes are wistful or triumphant its one of the many mysteries on a record that uses its shadowy atmospheres as an escape route even when it sounds stripped bare its post-modern pop for a generation growing more obsessed with dance music
since 2012 andrea mancini a luxembourg-born artist who splits his time between berlin and brussels has made synthy house under the name his earliest records leaned into deep house traditions but the music has become more lush and stylistically loose over the years for his third release mancini debuts on with three lengthy originals that emphasize atmosphere and crisp drum work you can hear the young producer growing bolder with his craft in s thick melodic sprawl and gated snares or in how spends five and a half minutes building to an understated climax the way blends rolling broken beats with early synth-pops starry timbres and motorik tension speaks to an artist wriggling free from genre constraints listen close to and you can pick out detail after tiny detail droning micro samples bursts of percussive flair distant mood tones rhythmic nuances and yet it doesnt feel right to call these tracks painstakingly produced each layer sounds like a natural part of mancinis patient process not a superfluous add-on covering for a lack of ideas remove a pattern of muffled claps at the wrong time and loses its light-footed momentum; if not for the constant twinkle in the background of the mix wouldnt get you so thoroughly buzzed most importantly mancini arranges every sound and movement to work in fluid harmony gently lifting dance floors off the ground before they realize theyre floating
ongoing obsession with detroit techno makes it easy to overlook the citys tradition of electro and of course electro never really stopped: from cybotron through to drexciya and dj stingray the motor city has a rich history of jittery and paranoid dance music that continues today thats the legacy that michigan native taps into on her strong debut album released through the imprint she runs with her ectomorph partner bmg the record is a definitively detroit affair but thats in a modern sense: its an after-dark journey through a fading metropolis all skeletal shapes and vast shadows though is her first major solo work is anything but a newcomer an accomplished dj and longtime radio host she has over a decade of experience in electronic music she also has quite a studio; the lp was composed entirely on her array of analogue equipment fostering a deep freeze feel la dopplereffekt but s music has a rare emotional depth as well her careful use of reverb makes the scope unusually wide rendering all the lonelier she has a way of making the hard analogue shapes feel malleable and liquid too: the melody lines on are sinuous and loose while the basslines on no feel as if they could pop off the rails at any moment can sometimes be fairly cookie-cutter but bucks the template more often than she embraces it lacking the textural tunnel-vision of her forebears tracks like and are made from discrete moving parts; the basslines are almost too big for the brittle structures they support creating a bottom-heavy heft that sounds like it could upturn the whole thing beatless channels the sound of flying saucers bearing down on your head for a relentless three minutes while feels like its slowly creeping up on you step after careful step the complete opposite of electros more typical charge its only the with its rough-seas bassline and twinkling alarm synths cribbed from early drexciya that engages with detroit electro in a direct and referential manner everywhere else presents an individual spin on a genre obsessed with its own history one indigenous to her hometown gently updating the sound reads like a love letter to the electro of days past written by someone who knows it inside out
two of finest artists in alex dolby santos combine in this double cd album to provide the best of the bunch of what this fine italian label has to offer showcases the pick of the bunch from the three labels under the mantra branch and includes the likes of not only the two mixing the album but makio scanty88 and madox to name just a few the album gets straight into the thick of it with alex dolby mixing the first disc the mix begins very nicely with his untitled valley and moves smoothly into hazy way recent release highlights are included such as the moody rathbone by scanty88 and the pace is quite solid for this first disc shown by nice flowing production such as base 1 by poonisher and the rumbling baselines of the paranoid jack mix of acid theory by maskio alex dolby includes a couple of his very massive productions in psiko garden and visionary lake and the very juicy rosaline in love by bellone sets up the conclusion to this mix in style that conclusion is the sizzling synths of tortuga tool by santos and it concludes a mix that was full of energy and really relentless driving moments santos as expected takes it on a bit more of a house route and begins his journey with the gritty moguai remix of his very own i m not homesick santos also unleashes his very brilliant sabot early in the piece creating a bit of a grungy beginning that continues on with extramode s beautiful day the mix starts to lose the gritty edge and shows a bit of funk in its armory with santos very solid remix of armand van helden s classic funk phenomena the mix then starts to hit peak time and it s well and truly there once it reaches the simply devastating phil kieran mix of madox and the resonance song madox is again called upon to take out the mix firstly with the chunky tribal sounds of careca and then the funky electro tinged hypnotic funk if you have loved what mantra has put out in the last year especially then this mix will definitely grab you in the right way they have definitely been a label on the top if its game and this double cd mix will show you why both mixes have a great raw energy about them that drives the mixes from the first to last track you will be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable showcase mix for a label then this
based on the little available info seems like a producer with modest intentions his soundcloud bio simply reads thanks for listening and the bandcamp description for his the truth will find you ep echoes the unassuming vibe: good friend andrew scott aka celebrates his love for detroit house disco and soul sure enough scotts deep house is brought to life by classic sounds and soulful vocal samples that seduce with ideas of love and truth mostly the music releases on niche house labels but lands on ninja tunes imprint stays far away from edgy sounds coloring inside the lines that masters like theo parrish drew its full of jazzy hi-hats ultra-wide drums and synth pads that coo and shimmer and are lush and mostly vocal-less something that gives character to the other two tracks has a funky cashmere groove which feels even softer once a female harmony rolls in midway the textures of are raw yet classy and near the end an inspired synth melody really lets it rip details like this add soul to the ep even if in the broader scheme of house music these touches are nothing new
after the very solid original and mashtronic remixes of warung beach by the bedrock imprint turn to europe namely finland and germany to provide the remixes in a release that is sure to be a big anthem in kiki from finland gets involved with a remix that is quite simply addictive kikis effort lacks any peaks or dips but it travels along with a groovy set of drums and bouncy melody yet has a distinct evil flavour thanks to the main riff it s a superb reworking by a producer that continually impresses the luetzenkirchen remix isn t as forgiving as the a-side; its a distinctly more peak time anthem full of twists and turns thanks to its warped out riffs and melodic pads used to great effect on s transitions mix and it is easy to see why this track was loved by john two very good remixes here with the kiki mix being the highlight of the package

industrial buffs should know all about genevi ve pasquier the german artist has been working with partner daniel hofmann (who also goes by anton knilpert and dan courtman) under various names for more than ten years pasquier a charismatic figure with a theatrical stage presence and capricious voice is the latest contributor to rivets proto-club series with a collection of material from her expansive back catalogue the title track from 2005s 7-inch is up first pasquiers voice is deadpan and robotic as metal wobbles gears whirr and cranky synths plod away in the background then theres where pasquiers cute monologue about chasing boys rubs against a thrumming bass and riled-up static noise the kind of friction that appears in some of her most compelling material bouge from pasquiers 2009 album cabaret moi is similar sung in french and featuring a jangled melodic accompaniment with a steady minimalist beat is the most delicate track of the lot and rounds off a great introduction to pasquiers sound
prior to its 20th anniversary appeared to be in the creative doldrums last few total compilations felt tentative and self indulgent dipping into indie rock and sketchy electronica cologne label was sounding tired and unsure of itself perhaps a time out was in order after the renewed vigor of total 14 this latest edition confirms the labels renaissance in short has rediscovered its soul its avant garde hinterland is still audible on but the fundamental focus is now on the areas where it excels that is sleek dance floor tracks full of imaginative leaps and the color of heartbroken electronic pop club stuff will be catnip to the faithful s tightly edited take on electro never gets old veterans and both excel the former in the blissful trance gymnastics of the latter with the deliciously strange wolfgang wasserman s is a typically delirious slice of avant techno selections from outside the immediate family also impress teasing drama of baumels vanishing exhilarates while rosenfelds is a progressive house track with the crossover appeal of inspector norse or body language its earworm hooks are played on piano bass and top end synths until they reflect each other like an endless hall of mirrors originally came out in february but it has sleeper hit stamped all over it n the pop side now sounds more like it fully understands the form emotionally charged electro house of s es is gorgeous as is s a surprisingly persuasive fusion of 80s pop soul and big room house s and comas contributions are more enigmatic but confident in the way they toy with pop tropes likewise the sultry trentem ller esque by a track layered with dustbowl blues guitar is one of s most accomplished forays into indie dance as its forthcoming jens uwe beyer album demonstrates is still providing a platform for experimental music but that output is now contained within sub labels and special projects such material makes less sense scattered across the total compilations this series has always been s annual attempt to try to shape mainstream house and techno in its own idiosyncratic vision nce again it has done so in style
its a jungle out there wherever is presently holed up the ambassadors fondness for civilized latin rhythms is known from his international pony collaborations but here hes foraging deeper in the undergrowth the real fun is had with snauzi peitsch a finely-wrought blend of neat cologne tech-house and wacky sampladelic invention after wading through a thicket of akufen-esque micro-sampling dodging vines of radio static and spectral voices buzzing like dragonflies were set upon by swarms of delayed pings and percussion sculpted from white noise where even the bass drum carries a tune halfway in maracas shimmy while portentous drones creep by amid conflicting families of bleeps growing odder and funkier by the minute djungle froot on the b-side acts as an interlude looping a brash synth riff more shakers and sleazy r b oohs and ahhs around a swinging digi-rhumba beat strictly cocktail hour material but its still classy: this is bound to wind up on a hotel costes comp if st phane pompougnac is brave enough it all ends functionally with na cha cha a no-nonsense slab of minimal programmed on woodblocks rim-shots and a dull kick stomped out by the dancing cover stars gargantuan feet so two slices of club friendly wonkiness and one for the earlier soiree
camille billie mandoki daughter of celebrated hollywood producer luis mandoki is a 23-year-old singer residing in mexico a visit to her soundcloud page should show a passion for writing melancholic music combining fragile piano with her own soul-stirring vocals head over to facebook and youll see shes a fan of alternative rock bands like my bloody valentine swans and slowdive so its curious that her first official release should land on nascent mexico city imprint whose output until now has carried a distinct club-ready flavour mandokis is no dance floor track though for one theres no beat nstead periodic strokes of sorrow-filled piano keep the pulse their intensity accentuated by gauzy pads and mandokis quasi-operatic delivery over the course of ten minutes the track edges ever closer to its stormy finale sending sheets of rain lashing against bouts of thunder and lightning ts long dense and largely unchanging but it draws you in antigravity steps up first on remix duties strapping knife-edged percussion and a heady veil of bass to echoes of the lead vocal theres something burial-like about it and it suits the originals aesthetic the same is true of emilis refix faintly echoing wolf+lamb-era nicolas jaar a slow sludgy stomp supports a toffee-thick bassline dramatic chords and mandoki in full song the ep is an example of both artist and label bending to each others vision without compromising their own

i was surprised at the lack of hype surrounding vincenzos third album last may as it was an impressive piece of work here dessous comes back for a second bite inviting two remixers along the original track has also been included though its almost a minute longer than the version found on the album other than the length the two are the same; smooth glossy chords and sultry female vocals the clap is also heavily loaded giving things a pleasing step rhythm a proven bet with deep house the uks jimpster is first up: instead of the originals lurking bassline he inserts a bouncy patch which ups the dance floor appeal slightly additionally the source vocal has been sliced up into tantalising morsels which hint at emotion rather than revel in it the second remix comes from tuff a fledgling project created by some fairly unfledgling guys aka robert johnson faves gerd janson and phillip lauer this version strays even further from the original than jimpsters almost to the point of being unrecognisable thats not a criticism though; its a jubilant and invigorating cut again utilising chopped vocals the pair add heavy reverb and clanking drum hits to match where the originals hook had a metronomic quality here its worked into a whirling chord succession which snowballs the whole track to a euphoric peak

to paraphrase one ra user is what drum bass should sound like even though drumfunk never really went away as ras angus finlayson stated in his review of s predecessor all the fuckin as its certainly not as common as it used to be paradox is of course still plugging away at it even releasing an album of drum breaks earlier this year the best thing about all the fuckin as was its clean metallic sheen yes it had a whiff of nostalgia about it but made those retro influences sound crisp shiny and new the ep was all about rupturing the dance floor but is a whole lot moodier theres more of a late-night ambience to it but all of s splintered drum programming is still in tact the title tracks ricocheting rhythms gleam while is more jazzy like squarepushers old broken-beat idm jodey s remix of juggles the dreamy and spikey sounds with even more finesse the technoid drums are fragile like thin sheets of glass and on certain hits they shatter and blow away

l leek and damon drama have done a considerable deed reinvigorating and re-establishing drum bass by bringing in outside influences and opening it up to a new audience in light of this its both surprising but oh-so-typical that the first preview of their long-awaited debut album is about as far from drum bass as you can get and rp are two bristling and single-minded tracks that walk over the same glowing electro coals as l leeks debut as oddika on nakedlunch like oddikas tracks its hard to tell if theyre techno or house or some new permutation of bass music judging from tempo alone theyre certainly not anywhere near drum bass or even dubstep shakes with a full-bodied tremble twitching madly as it subsists off of skewed and staggered drum programming ut its the unpredictable and irregular arpeggio that really impresses showing off the bands enviable studio setup and their documented love of hardware equipment its one of the tracks most removed from the groups previous which often fell into the drum bass line of horizontally tracked rhythms no matter their tempo rather deals in a type of tensely anticipatory sputter where one note seems to fall unavoidably into the next rp is a little more familiar emphasizing those ominous echoed chords that spell out utonomic and in this case particularly recall the touchy drama of watching you released as a limited edition single on semantica it makes for a confounding sneak peek of an album that seems almost impossibly mysterious at this point: the only certain thing is that judging from these tracks its probably going to be pretty good
a full ten years on from his first ubiquity album and has begun recording full vocal songs adding a soulful edge to his hip-hop and funk sensibilities a big part in this is played by the singer bart davenport who guests on three of the tracks here his cover of cymandes genevieve as included on the excellent rewind 3 compilation is a catchy bass line hook and a languid vocal beautifully done stevie wonders to know you is to love you taxes his range further in a powerful performance while the introspective make music adopts a hip-hop stance proves himself a good exponent of raw soul and funk too with sharon jones belting out got to be a love and gotta stand for something some of the instrumental passages are a little less effective here however and you feel that there should be a little more going on in tracks such as big titto on the other hand however there are tougher rap numbers like bronson with mainflo providing the rhymes and supplying some moody hip-hop beats a softly rolling percussion track provides the backing for see my eyes and at the end there are two bonus remixes which are well worth the trouble - a faster quantic remix of genevieve particularly fine so theres plenty to get from this new album a well planned and executed set of hip-hop soul and funk that reaffirms as a producer of some repute and broadens his target audience recommended both for background and foreground music
last years gremlinz compilation the kind of all-encompassing retrospective that usually chronicles dead careers seemed to single-handedly rejuvenate legendary grime producer his has been prolific by anyones standards with new releases on hyperdub butterz and rwina wisely moving away from his past horror-tinged strings into a brighter synth-focused palette his recent work has retained its cartoonish exaggerated sense of colour while sounding a whole lot more expensive this is unquestionably a positive thing the mammoth ep nearly an album at eight tracks and thirty minutes might be danjahs most complete statement showing remarkable restraint when necessary and clearly illuminating the gigantic leap in sound design hes made in the past year the ep kicks off with the rather subdued more atmosphere than drive with its main melody relegated to a g-funk riff that plays away happily unfazed by the booming drums that anchor the track its immediately obvious how much more spacious everything sounds: danjah has a newfound understanding of tension that makes his tracks even more visceral the interplay between delay and release manages to make even his once-hackneyed drops sound fresh and devastating each time they hit and when he does go for the jugular it hits home just check the return to staccato strings on and how much better it sounds now other astounding moments include the walloping piston whomp of the breathless rocky ascent of and the molasses-suspended breaks of slower sections or not the whole package is such an overwhelming rush of adrenaline its difficult to listen to anything else afterward
s one half of metro rea darshan jesrani is associated with a minimalist kind of disco but the duo also has an interest in song-oriented music morgan geist had storm queen his retro house project with damon c scott that landed a 1 hit in the uk in 2014 jesrani hooked up with dennis kane for a band inspired by the downtown new york scenes halcyon years their first two singles were winding journeys through wiry punk-funk disco and alearic sounds lush with live instrumentation and strong vocal performances on s third 12-inch for german label compost records they take a step back and focus on the essentials has a darker tint than its predecessors if s previous tracks were for soundtracking busy discotheques then this one is for stalking through backstreets and alleyways the drums ring out in dark corners the synth lead sounds uneasy the vocals wistful the instrumentation is simple: hints of cowbell buoyant disco guitars synth trumpets and keyboards all fade in and out without cluttering the mix ut is really about the bassline played by veteran session musician mark dann it walks jogs and sprints in all directions thanks to his nimble fingers sounds like the seedy underbelly of the new york scene its based on but that doesnt mean it cant be fun gavin gives a live-feeling remix its one of his gnarlier works layering discordant sounds and even building up feedback as it sputters along for ten minutes is something different for but they pull it off

nika roza danilovas music usually described with words like dark art gothic or just plain bleak clashes with her warmer and more luminous public persona or does it after all her 2009 the spoils long player was made strident demanding stuff as if kate waxs sonic artistry had met throbbing gristles abrasiveness but n something changed: danilova went from dark brunette to blonde and in 2010 both stridulum and valusia eps unveiled a newfound sense immediacy songcraft and overall awareness electronic pop tropes her brand new album is outcome this recent evolution danilova confessed she approached writing and producing se new songs with an overall grandiose pop feel in mind but that it wasnt in her after all this oxymoronic tension is never more apparent than on current single which fers same kind witchcraft stevie nicks was known for at peak her career mixed with an almost italo bassline tense syn tic stabs and disturbing vocal loops is moulded on same kind archetypal musicianship albeit with an added tribal vibe (serving as opening band on fever rays tour late last year obviously left its mark on psyche ) these are two prime examples how she has quickly and impressively matured from bedroom industrial experimentalist to perverse yet universal synth-popper luckily is filled with many o r half-lit dusk-tinged gems on or album closer for instance drums are tumbling strings are looming ghostly background choirs are roaming but just like night and sea talk singles from a while back yre also commanding melodic artefacts danilova also explores new rhythmic territories: like takes its cue from witch houses turgid tempos and has a steady 4/4 at o r side spectrum beatless and piano-lead ode might be more evocative (at least on first listen) lets say tori amos-like balladry yet echo chamber-like background effects suggest something far more intimate and sinister is most gratifying fering so far and whats upcoming should be even more interesting a recent collaboration with m83 and more alternative r b she records under nika rory moniker hint at a wide sonic universe her pseudonym might be inspired by frances most stark naturalist novelist but art is way more nuanced idealistic and baudelairean in essence making her act all more captivating
reforms head honcho returns with another tasty house offering and comes in the shape of three neat and tight mixes first comes the big room beats of the overdrive out there mix which has a squelchy blend of groovin bassline wet synth sounds and warm percussion thats enforced with the sexy vocal next up is the original mix and overall is more laid back in its delivery of a vibe thats got a live feel with an injection of rolling guitar riffs and the vocal that draws the track along finally mix 3 is a stripped back beat edit for the djs pleasure its not as big as the previous release in the house from dare but overall its neat and tight
after making his name as one of midwests foremost sonic auteurs at microhouses peak s spent last five years or so reshaping himself into a producer whose electronic-based music pitches toward americas past-rock glories as much as global dance music climes beginning with asa breed but perhaps peaking with brian eno and talking heads indebted tech-pop of 2010s excellent black city dear has continued to navigate poppier ends of electronic music spectrum in a fleet-footed manner that kept us guessing where hed be two years down line now with dears fifth full-length hes continuing to navigate broad crossover between two realms and for first time in a while in a manner that could actually serve as a companion piece to earlier work dear has spoken in interviews about a recent move from brooklyn to more pastoral reclines a few hours from city its interesting to note n warmer more peaceful glow especially in its second half compared to black city even if it still finds 33 year-old producer tracing sort of scuzzfuck corners of night that lp did fleshed out with flecks of african-style guitar and tumbling bass just listen to jungle rumble of res still trademarked bedrock: that motor-fueled machine-grind churn for example finds dear again trading in sleazy funk of you put a smell on with its slow guitar pluck and plodding bass is is a delirious jumpy thing topping slurred fast-pitched vocal clips with dears drug-blur voice and an arcing synth line lead single arguably best thing here opens with a distant buried vocal sample before a looping siren-like sound and neon arpeggiation layer in both and and are similar slices of cyborg-funk forefronted by muscular bassline and off-kilt guitar dear filling edges with only slightest coloring of synths as album settles into its second half though res a dawning of sorts to dears approach to sound a lightening around edges of first halfs sensual drive this contemplation this self-examination is matched by levity of dears music of for example sounds almost child-like with its soft smears of synth and slow rhythm setting stage for dear letting you into those momentary things inside his head re were days without rest/but wait im getting ahead of myself/feel like running/but i gotta stay put/cause im getting ahead of myself is similarly downy its intersecting synth melodies a tune of lullaby and finds dear emoting vocally across a backdrop of pulsating waves of sound that are almost sun-blinding musically its an optimistic and forward-looking moment that also serves as closing on latest chapter in dears evolution if its not quite full-step weve come to expect from him its final act certainly alludes to a man growing into warmth of new home-life to life unbound by cement and glass outlines of city to a place to stop and finally really brea
s 2006 album newstep was the first dubstep lp i ever bought and i was blown away by its simplicity the rhythms were off-kilter and confident the melodies ice cold the basslines sturdy and satisfying replacing his sharp synths and midi flutes with subtler textures diary of an afro warrior was more sophisticated but it still packed a wallop by 2013 s quick-footed rhythms and spellbinding melodies were gone replaced on chapter ii by rigid stadium-sized drops now that dubsteps mainstream moment is over seems to be reinventing himself and hes having a tough time with it last year spoke to the guardian about his severe mental health issues which he says were brought on by heavy drug use and excessive touring is his first new material following a year-long hiatus that he spent in recovery but rather than a return to form these three pumped-up dance tracks sound like an identity crisis from the top of the title track you can sense a lack of sound design the sloppy claps ring out first followed by flat kick drums lifeless hi-hats and a paper-thin bassline filtered through bad distortion every synth and sample sounds like a cheap preset which is unfortunate because sticks to this palette for every track he seems to phone it in on with its simplistic structure and a half-assed vocal hook ( moves not money ) laid out every four bars the closest he gets to a passing grade is an attempt at hard-edged electro though it too completely lacks texture and depth will hopefully get through these growing pains because right now he sounds lost
bristols dam always seems to pop up in unexpected places his latest move brings him to obscure belgian imprint udio and in typical fashion the -side is different than anything weve heard from him before adopts a similar palette to that of the often maligned future garage movement big fuzzy synths cheery melodies and a prominent vocal that rather intrusive voice adds the finishing touch to an already overstuffed track a quivering and heavily-autotuned thing that drives the songs unusual bassline downwards into unexpectedly nostalgic territory im not sure the jarring vocal ever quite earns its place but the dizzyingly busy track has its moments the flipside is easier to swallow with calling to mind s rubbery techno side grey in all the places where was sunflowers and rainbows the bassline borrows its sounds (and its swing) from dubstep but flattens them out into a sexy techno throbber fellow bristol producer gatekeeper seizes on the dubstep elements amping up the distortion and turning it into a dark garage roller
just in time for trick or treat michael mayer starts up a new imprint called dedicated to horror-centric disco or as the label calls it serial killer synth symphonies what gives are the germans finally catching the disco bug or as one ra forum poster asked is this kompakt does it better hard to say but a reference to the united states premiere spooky-synth disco label will only get you so far for while the us version promotes a kind of darkly sensual metropolitan suspense the germans prefer menace and bloodlust by all indications the agenda would appear to be trafficking in classic horror soundtracks the territory of greats like john carpenter claudio simonetti and goblin which has enjoyed a mini-renaissance thanks in part to music blogs like 20 jazz funk greats keeping in step with the germans the inaugural debut from chicagos largely disposes with the atmospheric end of horror music in favor of an onslaught of crushing beats after a dense disorienting opening with piles of synth flourishes settles into an industrial lockstep sounding like a pretty hate machine instrumental with more handclaps mayer and crew may rep carpenter et al as their main sources of inspiration but output by labels like wax trax and tvt are arguably just as influential here the rest of the ep traffics in the same style but trades less on musical distinction than on well-placed genre signifiers sounds like it was born from the ashes of its predecessor with a jackhammer electro beat replacing the reznor pound and a healthy dose of pulpy giallo dialog samples over an abundance of drum fills the track deftly maneuvers around a churning arpeggio which allows the groove to dissolve into atmosphere disappear down a blind alley or get lost in an endless shadowy forest of nightmares then suddenly gearshift back into the riff on the flipside clears the air with a haunting bell riff the template being most likely goblins supremely eerie score for dario argentos suspiria the sound of 1/8th note patterns walking up and down a minor scale evokes a killer tracking his prey up a creaky staircase down a country road at midnight through an abandoned factory likewise with its relentless electro drums closer has a hungry momentum that evokes the telltale line from night of the living dead : theyre coming for you barbara to scare up their thrills and chills largely follows an approach of baroque pastiche the horror tradition gets invoked in an excessive overwrought way with tunes clearly relishing in heaps of gothic bells screaming synths and militaristic snare fills the effect of cramming a decade of movie soundtracks into four tunes makes a bit like the andrew wk of horror disco not that theres anything wrong with that for someone like mayer whos played a pivotal role in the course of minimal techno baroque horror disco might be a way to keep the low-end lockstep but have a bit more fun at the same time well and michaels name is eerily close to the killer from halloween
is the last of s core stable alongside claro intelecto and andy stott to offer a debut album for the manchester-based label despite being the first of the three to release a single on the imprint the burnley-based duo of gary howell and miles whittaker have certainly bided their time while miles may have produced a handful of solid 12-inches under the mlz moniker it seems that the duo have spent the rest of their days working slowly and carefully to find soak up and discard new influences as they come and go largely through the doors of their boomkat store headquarters over the years have tasted and attempted a range of styles from idm breakbeat dubstep and of course minimal dub techno strangely or not then doesnt cross as much terrain as the explorations of the past would suggest the vast majority of what is presented here is smooth almost loungey dub techno with lithe watery textures and shimmering mirrored horizons the more overt dubstep inspired and the broken beat patterns of the calm remix of are the only exception to the more clandestine tidal ambience that permeate the rest of the tracks not coincidentally theyre also the albums least confident moments with this in mind it isnt easy to determine the sentiment of the album or the exact context in which the title should be taken at face value could easily be understood as a time to take stock of the past present and future the fact that it is not an album per se but a collection of tracks would seem testament to this but mixing five new pieces with six recycled or reversioned tracks means it isnt a greatest hits package or a logical collection like claro intelectos warehouse sessions either more so since there is the absence of representation from many of the earlier eps while last years is presented in its entirety one advantage of the selective revision is that the overall fluidity generates unbroken sensations of visionary waters and subliminal trances pulling highlights from this miasma is difficult since comes together remarkably well as a whole some limited sequencing of tracks also helps this as does the inclusion of and its processed guitars as a short but evocative introduction to set the mood similarly bookending proceedings with the sets feistiest tune from the ep lets the newer tracks keep their shape without stalling their restless currents for those hesitant to fork out for this handful of new tracks the material at least will not disappoint the ambient piece bubbles and trickles like a neutral mental stream while the corrugated basic channel rips and curls of will pull anyone under the spell of the sharp and fluttering percussion meanwhile languishes longingly in opium dreams but while is undoubtedly a solid collection of tracks that will win many new fans it still seems like only part of the picture who or what will be remains to be seen but from the strength of the material we can assume the best of and a best of are yet to come
is a new deep house label named after a group of beautiful islands in the south pacific stamped with palm trees and pressed onto marbled wax the colour of tropical waters the project has a clear sound: slow relaxed and meditative s second release it plucks more names from around the world adelaide berlin wisconsin for another 12 inch of chilled out grooves if theres a standout on its from joel (aka golden donna) and julian its so laid back it takes two minutes before anything happens but once its sighing horn sample locks into the dusty groove it gives off the worn charm of an old tiki bar s is another highlight with percolating chords and a bumpy techno style bassline that doesnt detract from the eps tranquil mood s brief has pads that shimmer like palm fronds swaying in the wind the other two tracks both untitled are less to write a postcard home about offers a loping house track that could use some extra bite while s effort edges towards moody electro which makes it a little out of step with the rest of the ep
over the past year or so patrick gr ser has revealed himself to be a truly inspired techno artist with his music as in 2012 he became a resident at berghain and released two spectacular eps the host and main mode both through marcel dettmanns label mdr those records showed a producer cut from the same cloth as dettmann and shed with a style that stems from the basic channel tradition of techno but is still very much his own on he more boldly explores this signature sound acrs music is defined by vivid sound design and an impressively flexible approach to rhythm his textures are sci-fi and subaquatic (a bit like porter ricks who gr ser seemed to reference with last years biokenetic ) his beats are unconventional but always intuitive like the artists on hessle audio or livity sound he sees endless possibilities in the placement of drums sounds within the measure and only occasionally settles for a four-to-the-floor pulse this is more true than ever on both of the records a-side cuts perepetia and are slow and syncopated yet deceptively dj-friendly with a mood that would suit the post-apocalypse scenes in terminator the b-side has more of a uk vibe shed appears as war with a blistering remix of the title track that true to form flirts with elements of jungle placing understated breaks over a bassline thats pure dread the original mix is both more understated and more well original with a pitter-pattering rhythm that creates a kind of odd weaving motion all four are some of the best techno tracks to come out of berlin this year

the next release on comes from minneapolis from his has already seen support from the likes of mazi lottie terry francis and here is why misuse of grace is first up and it begins the ep off in fine style with a nice deep tech house production full of full crisp beats and a very groovy baseline full of bounce a subtle piano line also rides over the loop as well as a a vocal sample that adds a nice touch on the b-side is firstly free r we and this production has a slight tribal feel to it with the nice percussive elements the track smoothens up with some warm pads and a nice deep gritty baseline and it flows smoothly for the most part much like the a-side following this is the evil eddie richards re-edit of free r we richards gives the track a little more of a tough feel with some edgier sounds and a more percussive feel this is quite a nice release here from resuce with 3 pretty solid productions and the a-side probably being the highlight of those 3
of all the ed banger posse is probably the most mysterious he doesnt have justices mass appeal mehdis debonair attitude uffies calculated sass or even pedro winters domineering persona in terms of actual music he hasnt released much: only three eps of original material have seen release since 2005 ( smoking ross ross ross and motor ) a workrate of that only enhances his aura of individuality in fact since his name started circulating about four years ago s craft has mostly been heard via his voluminous remixes and while its a banging body of work in itself collected here on its also a somewhat poisonous offering this otherwise gifted producer see no matter how you chose to lend an ear to these tracks (alphabetical chronological or the random assembly picked you) its highly doubtful you will ever feel any actual sense of progression everything sounds too coherent remixed artists are diverse ranging from quirky r b melodic electro; sweet female pop la or n dyia; or various indie groups such as and s main source of revenues apparently considering the symbolic capital a remix from his delicate french hands seems to have in these corners of the industry) but its as though the ian producer appeared on the maximalist scene already perfectly med and developed everything hes remixed since his early take on ves roaring has been marked by the same principles: chop thunderous breakbeats over heavily filtered synths straight out of the textbook pepper the result with the occasional hashed vocal bits and compress all of it into the monstrous digital grinder genetically engineered by ed bangers technological consultant team repeat again again again one more time (if they havent quite figured it out yet ) by the time you get to the remix a radical trans mation of the source material if there was ever one sounds self parodic leaving behind the originals subtle sense of sultry drama has instead made it worse never a good sign someone who built his career on trying to improve other peoples work only s by denotes some sort of derogation to these principles opting a slower tempo with lustrous strings while keeping most of the diamond like vocals: needless to say its the best thing on here mostly because it sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb by some weird musical law of diminishing returns it seems the more presents his singular vision the more he comes off as the one trick pony in the ed banger stable s motor ep saw him exploring with mixed results the incorporation of heavy metal to his sound palette but at least he was trying something new hopefully his long awaited debut artist album will take the sense of adventure hinted at in 2005 to new heights in the meantime this ill named compilation will seem very very pale in comparison to a cross the universe and lambs anger the two defining ed banger releases of the year
since his debut release in late 0 0 ristols (joseph mcgann a member of the young echo collective) has swung back and forth between neon-hued neo-garage and darker more traditionalist dubstep on his new record for his hometowns imprint he loops back to the winsome vibes of his first release for punch drunk the two-part is his most melodic work to date with gently harmonized vocals swept into shapes that flutter like pennants and nimble organ basslines reminiscent of mk it feels a little like an attempt to bridge the gap between todd edwards and james lake with chopped-up vocals smeared into a low-key haze the differences between the two versions are subtle; part one with its skipping -step rhythms focuses more intently on the dance floor while part two slumps its shoulders ever so slightly and slips into downcast daydreaming oth versions though feature exceptionally deft drum programming with spring-loaded rimshots accenting the lithe bumping-and-flexing garage grooves
in the booth dj bone favors wild combinations an extra turntable or two and an all-hands-on-deck approach to the mixer its no surprise then that his productions tend to offer streamlined straightforward musical ideas spare parts for mixes rather than masterworks in their own right thats not to say eric dulan hasnt released some deeply impressive tracks in the two decades or so hes been releasing music no sleep (true to da roots) a 2008 cut that began the prolific sect imprint exemplifies bone at his best with tightly wound samples and slamming drum loops combining in varying densities it feels a bit like a dj set in and of itself for his dont be afraid debut dulan tries on his new - alias name aside theyre pretty standard dj bone tracks not quite no sleep perhaps but unquestionably well-wrought tools he packs a fair amount of melody into different(hrall) layers of arpeggiating synths with wooshes of mellotron-style strings but the gut-punching kick drum leads the way pushing all the sounds along a mighty kick powers the core of different(ity) too though this one churns more than it strikes like the centrifuge at the heart of some heavy machinery the tracks scissor-like snares should send a shiver through the crowd as well though their offbeat placement actually lightens the load by lending some house to the techno throb a stylistic nod backed up by deep warm pads - (by dj bone) might sound wildly functional for dont be afraid what with oddballs like mgun and farah filling up the release schedule these days but bones craft is undeniable

yet to put a foot wrong in his short career s next installment of golden deep set dubstep is as sublime as any of his preceding output released through soul jazz (with a pair of cotti cuts and kalbatas solution out on the same day) this 12-inch finds david kennedy again pushing the envelope with another breaker of rich sonics is the more conventional of the two tracks melding a clinical techno tact to low-key 2-step struts to form something not far removed from wookie at his most austere without a doubt the most magnetic quality to the ournemouth-based kennedys tunes whether the primal chatter of limey or the high-end coils of carla is the percussion that s never been more the case than here as lurching synth waves ebb and flow above its anchoring drum kicks that recall the haunting acoustics and dread ridden caverns of shackleton s bleak beat ut lands away in its own intoxicated idyll is the remarkable one of the pair indebted to both the atmospherics of photek and modest flutters of krautrock pioneers cluster and harmonia its warm wraps of sullen electronics are effortlessly captivating s with fellow hessle honcho pangaea kennedy allows his tracks to breathe giving the stark echoes some teeth though not quite the landmark of limey this is ambient sunset dubstep that continues to mark out as one of the most accomplished and visceral producers going
traum do dubstep on label faithfuls (arne schaffhausen and wayan rabe) shift gears into a gloomy broken lurch departing albeit briefly from the puffy proggy tech-house that has made their name the shift is more of a step-by-step stumble as rhythms become increasingly fragmented track-by-track landing in a jumbled confused heap the destination aint so special then so the journeys where its at particularly when were on familiar turf neatly programmed on clear spacious grids drawn in weepy hues and powered by a gentle soda-pop fizz has all the trance-tinged hallmarks of prime neue schone -era theres a heady momentum which develops ever-so-subtly like minilogues more patient moments and it delivers plenty of heated anxious expectancy claps packs a more immediate punch stark electro drums set amidst a shimmering western backdrop akin to unds cowpoke hit rodeo but staggers at the break rhythms slip and slide dazed and untethered and the track never recovers by this stutter has become a full-blown speech impediment with schaffhausen and rabe somewhat unintelligible in downtown croydon faint hamburg stripes still visible through the odd breakbeats while this move seems hasty and i wouldnt recommend it to other traum acts house still delivers

as many an ill-fated remixer can attest its hard not to mess up classic chicago house which can be deceptively delicate in all its rickety ratchety glory tracks laid out with lots of open space and rendered by way of old lo-fi sounds would seem especially amenable to redux but it turns out that all that open space serves a function and all those old sounds seethe the way they do for the many ways theyre less than perfect s an acid track from 1988 certainly counts as classic chicago house and the three remixes here offer different lessons on what stands to come from the project of staring history down the s remix is the best in part for the evident respect it pays but more so for the way it amps up the originals energy without sapping any parts of the track in the interest of foregrounding another the turns the acid line up and keeps the originals drums clacking; his trick over a nicely concise five minutes is to simply add some additional drum sounds to fatten it up and then to play around with filtration to tease an overly dramatic (and likely ruinous) breakdown that smartly never quite comes jason s mix doesnt have the same kind of devious life in it reducing mostly to a throb and only hinting at the 303 squeals buried deep in the background hugo s offering starts off in a similar mind fit for a big club where just the suggestion of a track will bounce around the rafters but s mix boasts more of a sense of exploration in the way it staggers and builds
(rl-x) was the name of a 2015 exhibition from the artist david lieske it featured copies of lieskes autobiography a book that couldnt be obtained anywhere else alongside munitions boxes camouflage nets and other paramilitary objects the idea was that lieskes life must be tactically conquered beholders and readers are invited to take hold of and occupy it the exhibition gives its name to two exquisitely moody tracks on lieskes new album as is an elegant drum track over which string chords and snippets of sampled speech set off sumptuous ripples of melancholy echoes the skewed baroque harmonies of early plaid tugging at a dense web of emotions yearning sadness paranoia that takes several listens to unpick like his art lieskes music deals in autobiography ( a 2007 track that reappears on this album was made in a very unhappy time when i was really confused about love or what it might could or should be ) but as with (rl-x) lieskes tracks dont give up these insights without a fight his first album since 2001 riffs on the exhibitions theme from its war-jargon titles to the crouched rifle-bearing figure on the cover the music can be equally unwelcoming the album opens with an from lieskes band whose solemn droning dissonance prepares us for the worst the following track is overlaid with the muffled sound of thunder lieskes broad sonic panoramas often hint at a distant menace from there the musics subtler emotional shades become more visible and the title track one segueing neatly into the other are heart-melting cascades of keys and strings echoes stl in its funky sultry dissonance as if lieske hit all the wrong notes on the keyboard while making a detroit house track none of this is any great surprise lieskes style hasn t changed all that much since he cofounded dial more than 15 years ago and doesnt sound like the product of years of studio toil but theres still something unresolved in his music some internal terrain weve yet to conquer and whose inaccessibility makes it all the more intriguing lieske seems to find catharsis on the albums penultimate track which lacks his usual melancholy shadow but a sombre from complicates things again
s theme is disruption the daniel sannwald artwork a hyperreal graphic of an engine reflecting a forest is said to represent a violation of nature in the music aka james kelly revs his machines in fits and starts seldom letting a track settle for long a song might come to a dead stop only to return in a flood by the next bar the ascending swells of are made more dramatic by periodic silences in several ways is a change in s sound his music often found a solemn intersection between gothic pop and electronic music whats between rendered isolation in earthy singer-songwriter tones and radio static but is more abstract and sometimes violently so wreathed in synthetic sounds and pressed forward in jump cuts the ep falls into orbit with oneohtrix point nevers garden of delete kellys voice is the most interesting thing here he chops his vowels into single notes and plays them through a keyboard on the playing gets tighter as the song climbs until the sounds seize up into a double-time rhythm on kellys syllables are almost organ-like despite its sudden movements and wounded cries can also be beautiful subverts the eps reference points (post-dubstep james blake rustie) with an orchestral string section but kellys destructive streak soon shows up again pummeling the tracks coda with ragged bass drums

s third ep is their most substantial release to date a four-tracker of drum-centric techno hybrids for producers rich mcmaster and tom marshallsay (aka dam mantle) have eschewed the effusive house of their debut on mister saturday night and instead continue the bleaker train of thought started on its follow-up hit it / kick out with curiosity and invention uses its added runtime to further explore the many corners of percussive dance music hard-edged as it all is theres a strong undercurrent of levity: molcorp sneaks distant clucks into its flurry of hand drums and the stuttered groove in makes liberal use of an error sound from classic mac computers save for whirlwind drum-machine solo is built with innumerable percussion samples which are chopped and sequenced into precisely interlocking movements s patterns are often busy but they never feel cluttered molcorp for instance has no trouble finding room for soggy synth swells and other rhythmic textures within the complexities of its booming multi-layered beat the jumpy momentum of reaches a fever pitch early on so the tunes actual climax hits when the duo strips everything down to its hulking skeleton such sneaky twists and remarkably calibrated arrangements are part of the eps allure but its staying power comes from just how fun can make severe drum tracks sound mcmaster and marshallsay keep their drums loose and dynamic like each intricate rhythm was performed collectively in a big room and they also have a flair for hallucinogenic details
s biggest tune doppelwhipper was reportedly knocked out live that is extemporized in the studio the difference between it and these two tracks is that post-production is eschewed in the latter case they bear resemblance to doppelwhipper on one level its nanda in rolling floor-working mode while centralising a single emblematic melodic hook but on another theyre rawer and full of spur-of-the-moment builds and drops that smack of an experienced producer in front of the masses lpha s star performer is a gentle shriek that chirps semi-manically while string-like pads soar all carried through an end-of-the-world epic chord progression in the darker side of 80s synth pop dons an iridium visor and boards a spacecraft before engaging a warp drive into tomorrow thanks to a pad that sounds like it could have been borrowed from utechres incunabula the latter is heavier the intro rattles like a beefed-up spastik but this is soon drowned in a fully charged pummel of battering white noise growling bass and an exhaustive selection of drum samples it loses some of the quirk that characterises his best material but in its place is an unrelenting assault on a magnitude that rivals anything hes released yet
the electro-heave that begins s could go anywhere electro razil and glitch are audible in its steady roll ut when the synths come in bright and hissy and pointed and then the bass sequencer starts jumping up and down the track shows its cards: this is vintage terror-flick synth soundtrack music lot of that going around lately huh was on the seed x part 3 compilation back in june but the re-rub on the -side by diskjokke gives it a new lease two ways the widescreen purview that stamps diskjokkes music is most of what he brings to the beats are thicker but not obtrusively so; the synths are more even and insinuating rather than wild and hooky high siren squeal enters the remix early and is so eerie i hoped it would be a repeating motif but alas just the once instead theres a gradual glazing over as the track moves on almost like a dub where all the aural close-ups somehow make everything gauzier
has everything you want from a record: dangerously fast drum machine loops polyrhythms thick distortion that hisses and spits on everything the five-track ep his first for powells diagonal label is no radical departure from the sound hes developed over the course of multiple albums and eps and thats fine ren schofield knows his strengths and instead of fixing what aint broken hes tweaking his sound subtly with each release schofield has a couple new tricks here specifically a textural touch that goes deeper than usual listen closely to the title track and youll hear a quiet chewing in the background like a termite with a contact mic takes the intensity down to a languid 100 bpm focusing on quirky sample work rather than the standard barrage of drums it plods a bit at that tempo though its interesting to hear schofield reach beyond pure intensity for something creepy and unsettling the eps other three tracks are only a few distortion modules away from straight-ahead electro theyd sound right at home mixed alongside rough-and-tumble records from the likes of dj stingray or dj overdose even with their abused edges and screaming feedback

six years since the lisbon label was born describing the music on pr ncipe remains a tricky task numerous genre descriptors swirl around its strange and vivid records kuduro batida kizomba funan tarrachinha reads one label biography formulas are broken more often than they are upheld perhaps pr ncipes one constant is flux as the labels pedro gomes said to ryan keeling in 2014 this music has been brewing for centuries through the slave trade through immigration and now through digital technology made by afro-portuguese producers in lisbons poor neighbourhoods it channels flows between portugal its former colonies and the rest of the world and between the city and its deprived suburbs this state of flux is coded into n dias music she grew up in lisbon but moved to bordeaux when she was 14 and her music echoes this displacement on her debut release 2014s estudio mana on brother sister records was a track called v a g g : v a for vale de amoreira the ghetto where she grew up and where kuduro ruled ; g g for ghetto gang because its my ghetto and my gang was always told not to forget where come from two years later on her debut album proper is whose melancholy piano chords are fractured into stark shapes over a wildly broken groove this emotional edge might help explain why n dia (formerly n dia minaj after a musical idol of hers) has become one of pr ncipes more widely known artists though 2015s nger her pr ncipe debut and breakout record packed plenty of dance floor heat there were some surprisingly gentle moments among the neck-snapping drum loops n dia m n dia fudida her debut album has its tender spots too on a liquid guitar lick loops morosely; right after ups the melodrama with a brash lead and heat-woozy chord stabs but n dias music isnt just sad more than her past releases n dia m n dia fudida demonstrates her range twisting the unplaceable grooves of the afro-portuguese style into numerous intriguing shapes theres thunderous beat science ( where toms snares and kicks form a dynamo of flailing limbs) shrill fanfares of digi-brass ( and at opposite ends of the record both headache-inducing) belgian-style rave gear ( ) and a detour into tarrachinha slow-mo (the sly ) as an album its scrappy n dias short anarchic tracks were never going to play nicely in the lp format but as a document of a sound in flux its as bold and fascinating as anything on the label
many of s releases examine an idea through a microscope revealing something previously unseen in the process s lens zooms out and fixes its gaze on polyrhythms which on he explores in three different ways the title track is the most hair-raising with its drums tumbling in a noisy atmosphere of laser bursts spinning helicopter blades and sudden toxic emissions sounds as if it should come with instructions for the nearest fire exit but even as it mimics disaster always sounds in control unspools with relative ease its rhythm is supple: each one-shot is softly struck the congas in particular and the shakers are sucked backwards brushing against the drums as they move in opposite directions the effect sounds somewhere between the cosiness of basic channel and the looseness of moodymann but theres tension simmering underneath most of this dissipates on whose short lurching loop is orbited by swirls of noise an overworked tick and gut-punching sub-bass having expended so much energy elsewhere eases up on but even as the music winds down it remains gripping
part 2 of the epiphany ep by again features 2 more peak time house monsters from the label out of canada rock your world kicks off part 2 in style with a nice tough gritty production that doesn t feature any filtered business like the first disc a tough electro baseline is the main feature throughout as it drives the track alongside a muffled vocal line and strong drums on the flip we have got soul which is the most melodic track of the four featuring nice string patterns and smooth melodic touches not to mention a nice groovy baseline and smooth crisp beats a nice way to close the ep off disc two is slightly the stronger disc of the two if i had to choose with both tracks adding a diverse touch to the ep unlike disc one which had two pretty similar productions
when i spoke with guy brewer last year he repeatedly emphasized that his strengths lay in texture and not melody his focus on the physicality of sound is the thread that ties his projects together droning techno as shifted depressive electronica as covered in sand or which he calls straight-up noise appeared as an uncredited project on blackest ever black with 2013s a luminous veil an engaging record that gently mapped a spectrum of noise music from harsh to soothing released on the cassette label is a simpler affair with two long-form compositions on either side of a tape is probably the least accessible thing brewer has put his name to the first side is like watching a fire: theres something oddly compelling about the oppressive heat it gives off especially once youre in the thick of the high-frequency assault during the final minutes if you can stomach that youre rewarded with the calmer flipside made of hollowed-out tones that drone with an unnerving consistency so you cant tell if youre imagining the shifts or if theyre actually happening is strictly for the diehards but fans of brewers textured approach to pitch-black electronics will find much to love
the hardest working man in the scene in returns with a track that really stands out from his usual productions with huge bloc-party bassline and a breakdown in the middle to bring people to their knees anyone who likes tony s style (and those that don t) should check out the energy levels and no nonsense party vibe of ride dat beat flip it over for caveboy and the energy levels remain at their dizzy heights rolling tribal drums and foreign female mutterings make this a truly dizzy bloc party saturday night indeed
zer always seems to come out on top within a few years of moving to berlin from istanbul in the mid-00s zer found himself in the upper echelons of big-room minimal regularly sharing the decks with (and occasionally showing up) scene-leading djs like ricardo villalobos and raresh now that hes taken a few steps away from the limelight zers quietly become a key name in a burgeoning mostly berlin-based scene that values deep digging broken beats and heady dj sets three years from his last solo record zer here delivers whats so far the standout release from a growing wave of producers associated with the scene hes helping to shape arriving on treatment collaborator binhs label (which only four records in is arguably among the best in the game) the four-track ep is equal parts deranged breezy and functional its also an electro record if only vaguely which tune you like best might depend on your mood the title track (which also opened a mix from binh back in 2014) is atmospheric and faintly melancholic with hazy stabs and a chugging beat the second a-side cut is more energetic thanks to a wobbling bassline and a collage of synth bleeps and snippets and are more straightforward and slyly melodic with an ambiguous feeling somewhere between playful bliss and steely futurism both tracks are guaranteed bombs blending a controlled sense of chaos with tight highly textured production and powerful functionality (traits that as ras mark smith recently found out set zer apart as a dj too) is a defining release in an exciting time for stripped-down dance music which is primarily being driven forward by the dj sets of zer and his friends where so many of the styles key names mine the sounds of the past zer puts a fresh twist on those discoveries

you can file next to getting me down and pearson sounds deep inside refix as s most ubiquitous dubplates ut is genius or gimmick its gremlinized vocal sample the stuff of bad trips is instantly recognizable ut for something that essentially became an anthem (as anyone who saw a prominent dj play in spring would attest to) is bizarrely structured its more like a bunch of disassociated hooks colliding at will from the repeated too much too much vocal that suddenly becomes an anchor in the midsection to the distorted chords that feel like theyre deliberately rubbing against the grain the songs appeal lies in its shock and awe hitting with the jarring (the vocal sample) and then the hypnotic (the other vocal sample) its like a jittery unfocused sugar rush or some other white powder -side is the fuller club jam focused on propulsion rather than its flipsides cheeky teases of melody the songs crux is the forceful bass thud characterized by its title like its trying to pull the ground up from underneath with every hit has a dreamy synth breakdown and the moment it slams back into the main section with those pitched-down vocal samples it should be clear exactly which big-name producer is behind this particular slab of anonymous vinyl that joy o(rbison) would want to separate his identity from these tracks (even after blew up) doesnt feel like a publicity stunt though the mystery certainly didnt hurt the tracks universal appeal instead considering the producers move towards house wade in source delight ellipsis feels like a one-off bout of dubstep-friendly regression in his current progression i still dont know if its genius or gimmick but whatever it is it works
derrick boyd might look like a 60s hippy refugee but the first album from his project with his partner zoe presnick feels like it belongs in an ibiza disco from 25 years ago its the kind of thing that might have greeted the protagonist of lcd soundsystems losing my edge when he woke up naked on a beach in ibiza the duos first album deals in a melange of soft rock punk-funk electro-pop and proto-house of the sort were told soundtracked the white isle in the mid-80s a sound enshrined in clubland lore though precious few experienced it first-hand having said that the first few tracks here might make you think youve woken up with the sweats in brooklyn live bass and spiky guitars give surrender and love kissed a jerky no wave swagger while boyds vocals alternate between shrill and deadpan as he delivers chalk hill s tongue-in-cheek lyrics about cocaine flying but then just as youre settling in for a full album of lo-fi disco lost in the machine plunges into what could be the soundtrack to the lsd freakout in easy rider all weird chanting backwards drones mysterious harps and clattering percussion that psychedelic vibe is even heavier on still standing which starts on an acoustic psych-folk tip before erupting into proggy space rock where you belong drops us back in the balearics before we get s previously released cover of q lazzarus goodbye horses and the bittersweet electronic ballad love sail people and leftfield are the type of blissful organic house thats more suited to a classic danielle baldelli set than anything from no 19 artists like art department (whose jonny white executively produced this lp) indeed one of the few things you wont find on is the sort of deep house boyd delivered as dead seal on his 2009 album corpus animus though it too made use of boyds voice corpus animus was an album of tracks rather than songs based on this lp and their recent live performances it seems he and presnick want to be an oddball pop duo rather than straight-up dance producers then again based on are never one thing for very long
daniel avery and volte-faces affinity for each other (if not outright friendship) was made clear as early as january of this year when the latter artist reworked platform zero from 0 3s drone logic seeing as volte-faces first officially released production shared space with the likes of r dh d and silent servant it stands to reason that an extra connection may have been there from the start sure enough confirms suspicions with the two londoners joining forces as to their credit the duo dont seem set on mimicking either averys crossover acid-techno or casper clarks greyscale charlatan ep for their debut release instead the two originals on dig into a common ground of nimble warehouse drums and thick intoxicating atmospheres what may come as a surprise to fans of either producer is how much color appears in and the latter is especially generous with it fading heavenly synth pads into its smokey terrain as an overt play at euphoric catharsis and it works the standout is like peak-era orbital trying their hand at berghain techno isnt so transportive but it does well with tracky intentions as the percussive churn tumbles straight through the mist (this records closest thing to an avery signifier) it picks up echoing organ blips and rat-a-tat hi-hats until just about the end of eight minutes use as a transition towards showier fare and its momentum will surely payoff dj and svreca remix and respectively both of which raise the tempo and claustrophobia to peak levels the japanese artists production is a tourniquet-tight sequence of synth blips acid lines and incessant drum machines on endless loop while svreca ditches the beautiful melody of for something spooky and grim neither remix bests s originals but they nonetheless provide more extreme versions of the duos shrewd techno
following a long string of releases for perlon thomas lchior releases his first solo single on cadenza home to 2006s massive solomons prayer/father recorded with cadenza boss luciano lchior slides comfortably into the cadenza pocket as both tracks on the ep are hallmarked with the labels signature layered percussion and a distinctly deep house feel t) is a swirling hypnotic affair buoyed by a circular bell riff deep plunging chords and a rather lost sounding female vocal line assume its intentional given the title ) the results arent terrifically memorable though skilled and enjoyable enough but neither the vocal hook nor the circular riff stick in your head for very long nor is anything very interesting done to alter the sounds throughout the tracks eight-plus minutes which leaves the deftly layered percussion as the only thing to really stick with you and unfortunately it doesnt that isnt the case however with which rumbles along on a bed of latin percussion and subtly shifting organ chords that stay just out of time all punctuated by a pair of clipped vocal samples one short clipped and male one extended echoed and female its simple sparse and most effective: the percussion-and-vocal interplay is expertly mixed and the big percussion sound works perfectly with maximum amplification lchior may sound a bit directionless on the a-side here but in letting the rhythm do the work for him on the flip he finds his way eventually

recent years have seen carl craigs label stray from their roots welcoming a variety of producers operating outside of the 313 area code while this diversion towards more of a european techno sound or even a european spin on many of craigs classic production tropes may have caused plenty of ire from purists the imprints summer release schedule should provide hope for fans who would rather see carl craig showcase homegrown talent from the city are behind the first of three consecutive detroit 12-inches on the label and offer a firm retort to the doubters hankering for a more soulful sound with lead cut combining fluttering organic percussion with a strident four-to-the-floor kick and tambourine this is deep house with an eye for the floor with the duos main producer darryl caliman waiting a good three minutes before simultaneously bringing in the bassline and some shimmering wobbly chords to great effect its firm kick drum and upbuilding tribal techno undercurrent should make it fairly easy to slot into a harder set with shonie cs subtle vocal inflections adding a bit of colour to the dance floor carl craigs own beats of the track is far from essential but its booming minimal house vibe could be a useful transition tool for jocks favouring the driving linear nature of dutch tech house labels like remote area rounds the package off on a more brooding late night tip using a heavily phased modulation and regimented hats to create a casual rolling atmosphere its functional enough but its the breezy but techy groove of thatll keep dance floors happy throughout the summer and beyond

founded more than a decade ago morris udio has become a solid proponent of deep emotive groove-lead house and their latest offering from michael dodman is no exception for the opener dodman utilises an overused vocal sample that sounds anything but tired in this setting pitching down and drawing out the already doleful let me give you devotion gives it an even more pained and despondent feel used sparingly over a slow juddering 4/4 it gives the track an exceptionally powerful vigour crawling bass thumps and gritty synth-stabs creating the rhythmic insistency of a much faster beat with of time plants one foot firmly in the garage of the house he was previously occupying significantly increasing the tempo and focusing all but the barest scraps of his attention on the synergy between kick and bass which proves more than enough to carry the tune through for and his grand finale dodman creates a seething whirlpool-like environment with metallic tempestuous skies and an undulating landscape of muted pads which slowly fall away to reveal a brutally effective bassline
its been nearly nine months since danilo plessow released a record in his series but the young producer hasnt been resting on his laurels theres been an ep for 2020vision one for four roses an excellent remix of dj sprinkles grand central pt i and even a well-received podcast for this here website along the way s nice as all that is though the are what drew my attention to plessow and ive been anxious to see if his newest 12-inch would be infectious as the previous installment i shouldnt have worried continues with the template that made 3 and 4 so special: plessow stakes out a quick-hitting funky organ lick over a soul sample leading up to a satisfying climax every 8 or 1 bars when he lets loose with some long chords dd a scratchy guitar a diva saying something that i still havent been able to exactly pick out 2 listens in and youve got yourself a deadly effective dance floor tool if is the uptempo party anthem is the slow burner in many ways its lengthy build-up recalls plessows non- productions under the name hovering underneath the chiming keys and steady beat theres a lovely drone that slides along almost imperceptibly that adds a wavering sense of menace to the track things pick up when the de rigeur anonymous diva makes her way into the track but it never gets much past this solid driving groove in the hands of the right dj though this should be all they need to build into something beautiful

ritish duo have never been an easy act to pigeonhole their singles and mixes for manchester s up-and-coming imprint have have gleefully romped through genres as diverse as classic hardcore dub and ambient techno and true to form their latest ep sees them shirking the electro timbers of their previous 12 in favor of a cavernous take on the dub techno format that has proven so popular this year easing in on a pillow of richly layered pads swathed in just the right amount of reverb and echo the single s lead track settles into a lumbering groove underpinned by a chest-caving kick drum tastefully adorned by acid-edged arpeggios the track is propelled forward by crisp snapping snares relentlessly coasting along until the bottom is ripped out and the mix is let loose to dissolve into a mist of slowly decaying lfo and delay feedback in contrast rick on the flip is a more laidback affair featuring softer drums and skittering cymbal patterns propping up a dense wall of slowly pulsing chords it s not too far removed from the more dancefloor cuts in kompakt s pop mbient series and provides a wonderful counterpoint to the more direct assault of the -side this twelve is by far s most well defined statement yet is one of their heaviest bass workouts but both sides will prove useful either working the crowd up into the peak hours or letting them down easy when it s all coming to an end let s hope stick with this sound for a bit it has potential
variety genres steve odman has been involved in over his career is remarkable from dubstep to grime to k funky to s forlorn garage and more recently to footwork theres not a whole lot the k underground that doesnt bear his footprint in some way as a result his recent sets have been especially adventurous; tempo is nearly disregarded tracks are haphazardly jammed together and the whole thing is more about feeling than technicality to see him do it live is enthralling if not exhausting as he flips through genres like pages in a book nsurprising then that the tracklist for his rinse mix is all over the map how do you follow with and then find your way to a 15 track stretch footwork s the kind setlist that would seem to demand pure wizardry and true enough sometimes it doesnt work beginning is rocky snapping to a start with s before is shoehorned in ly to simply fade into s plaintive vocal cut things eventually come together into the heavily swung k funky indebted music hes associated with but even then his path seems to shoot out in all directi s hes great at bridging things together as tracks from and but more boisterous moments from and stop the mix cold with their triumphant refrains odman has a rough and ready mixing style learned from years pirate radio which makes rinse feel nicely f the cuff and here those stylistic tics feel more dominant than ever sometimes tracks begin out nowhere and swallow up their predecessors the kind live in acti moment you would hear tuned into rinse looking past the occasi al awkward transiti you get a real sense that odman just mixes things differently than every e else sick rbis s t p youve never heard it handled like this where its booming bassline becomes elastic and bouncy no matter how you look at it this isnt your typical mix cd odman sounds most assured when rinse rockets into the footwork sessi that brings it to a close weaving through complex rhythms and thickets vocal samples it shows how much the chicago sound has been evolving since it began receiving internati al attenti in 009 ts also a jarring change from the first half as if we were another cd entirely s the most challenging aspect rinse : its as restless as you expect it to be but for every bump in the road theres a great or delightfully bizarre track waiting around the next corner rinse might not be s best mix cd but its definitely his bravest
theres a danger in moving to berlin djs and producers will tell you youre having such a good time enjoying the variety of party choices in the techno capital that you forget to work on your own craft for ren breitbarth however the move to berlin has been a hugely fruitful venture unlocking a sunny disposition in his work that always lingered right beneath the surface last years le rythme korg ep had a deft touch thats carried through to his newest on treibstoff for a career that seemed mired in forgettable tech house with highlights few and far between berlin has served to revitalize his creative spark blame it on club der vision re the inspiration for his recent r podcast its given his work a new buoyancy the tracks here are deep and frothy building slowly to minor refined climaxes: the title track washes chords back and forth for six minutes over a tech house beat before finally unleashing the main theme and knocking the house down slowly but surely meanwhile is a tech house groove that matches its percussive intricacy with a lovely interlocking pinging melody and jangles more than a (nominally) deep house track has any right to sounding a bit like kufen gone pop while each track here sounds decidedly different each brims over with the sort of enthusiasm that you might not expect from a producer more than a decade into his career for many a move to berlin is an economic necessity to continue their dream of being an electronic musician for breitbarth it seems it also helped him to remember what made him want to be one in the first place
another release featuring the productions skills of - this time a double a side featuring the bedrock vocal mix of and the original mix of doyzz john digweed has been hammering both on his recent delta heavy tour of america this heavy rotation has led to another heavily hyped bedrock release as the trend towards more anthemic tracks being released on the better progressive labels continues is this the backlash against the more minimal side of prog if so it sounds good

i just dont know what im supposed to be you know im stuck does it get easier this ambivalent snatch of dialogue in whats a girl to do (sourced from sofia coppolas lost in translation ) doesnt exactly suggest dance floor dynamite yet the 2004 track is bas brons biggest hit as having received a high-profile reissue on dekmantel this summer perhaps its very innocuousness is the secret to its success its sweet and melancholy but doesnt overstate its case brons latest album the first new yamaha material since the reissue is just as unimposing so much so that id listened to it half a dozen times before i noticed its political message res the album title of course plus loaded track titles like ( departure in japanese) and news in has been dominated by the worst global refugee crisis since world war and seems to be brons own humble commentary on the situation his angle its tempting to line up a further two titles and brons music as yamaha has never paid much attention to boundaries occupying a tuneful interzone between detroit electro and whimsical japanese video game soundtracks with he focuses on the projects friendlier side avoiding uptempo numbers in favour of limpid heartstring-tugging melodies and gently bumping drums tracks like and coast by gorgeously exquisite might even be as good as whats a girl to do re are weak spots: mainly the two vocal tracks whose heavily autotuned performances sit at odds with the well-judged arrangements featuring is particularly cheesy but brons charms work slowly and by the fourth or fifth listen youre so beguiled by the album as a whole that these blips hardly stand out album ends on a less comforting note closer is pretty but leaden placing yamahas sad side front and centre sparkly e-pianos are joined by a single sung note more a sigh than a melody maybe bron is conceding that while the lines between places might be imaginary their consequences are very real as ever he expresses the idea with rare grace

the buzz surrounding s earlier this summer is a prime example of the social media hype machine at work in early june a raver tweeted a video of the techno artist playing the track for the first time at junction 2 festival in london on july 20th a brief clip recorded live at hideout festival was posted to soundcloud by the time it was released in mid-august launching fitzpatricks new label it had more than 120k plays by now that number is past 351k to put that into perspective floorplans ubiquitous smash never grow old (re-plant) one of the biggest techno tunes in recent years has 181k plays after two years so why the hype for one its no coincidence that blew up during the warmer months its built for festivals with a huge catchy rave riff punchy percussion and throbbing kicks that collapse into slinky drum breaks the composition is smart and simple the mood is all summery joy its easy radio-friendly fun and surely fitzpatricks most accessible track to date fans of his deeper productions bangers like skeksis or the emphatic truant might find this one less rewarding on repeated spins but fitzpatrick has nonetheless succeeded in writing a summer anthem
frequent ppleblim collaborator and regular face on labels like us offers up an ode to pirate radio with its an extensive but simple look back: he digs the electro bass keytar-esque licks and steppy house rhythms out of the attic and lets them do their thing while inherently reverent the combination manages not to succumb to mere 2-step homage propped up by s ever-present ebullience and some footwork-y sampling paul special request has been on a bit of a pirate radio tear recently so its no surprise to hear a remix from him on the flip s apparent obsession of late has been channeling the future through the lens of memory and he continues to surprise here flipping into supremely vibrant machine music yet theres something surprisingly hands-on in his approach: gorgeous new melodies obsessively interlocked rhythms even snippets of the original getting pulled back by some anonymous radio jock certainly put a nice spin on yesteryears sound but truly knots up the continuum
if s abweichung and freiland klaviermusik were just a tad bit too experimental for your tastes you may well give a try: this is a 12-inch on that you can hear without bothering yourself with mathematic equations and philosophical investigations it is quite simply some righteous club music that happens to take a pounding piano as its base instrument chords march in time to the four-four beat on the title track with an upper register melody sneaking its way into the stereo field at odd intervals but crucially its mixed so low that you can ignore it if youd like sometimes you do you know and sometimes you dont like on which has those pianos working double-time until voigt gets almost jazzy on us it sounds a bit like the live investigations that brandt brauer frick have been making over the past 12 months and presumably without all the sweat that the trio expend doing it with live instruments the predictably lovely dj remix figures out a way to balance avant and ass perfectly making the drop that his synths take down to a lower octave sound like the most ecstatic and academic thing in the world
recently thanks in no small part to d ridge and instra:mentals utonomic activities a sound has evolved in clubland which as of yet has no particular name but rather tends to go under the tag 170 pm bass music or somewhat tangentially minimal (no not that kind of minimal) despite its genealogical relation to drum bass obvious but strangely ambivalent to call it that would be if not wildly off the mark at least in some sense misguided or in the case of exits latest biscuit takingly sparse offering just plain weird bysmal which pops up late on in the aforementioned producers recent fabriclive workout is a case in point even compared with fellow russian kontexts skeletal take on dubstep (similarly drenched in the ghostly techtronica of pole monolake and shackleton) its lean muffled bass static hiss and spectral fragments of deserted lab ambience make for captivating if uneasy listening while a gliding lead melody set majestically against a pitch-perfect 4/4 breakdown evokes real tarkovskian desolation nd then theres the title track which seems to be engaged in a kind of bass-fuelled reductionist endgame like atomic decay caught on mic and pumped through a woofer were talking muted subs tepid blips icy clicks and a smattering of mine shaft percussion and thats it (in other words the kind of thing data pinch or reakage would make on a strict vainio/raster-noton diet) excellent it most certainly is packed full of chest-caving low end pressure and militantly economical in design ut drum bass goodness only knows
and new yorks have enjoyed a fruitful relationship for some years now on his latest outing for the label a limited-edition boxset the bristolian producer presents whats described on the lavish packaging as a personal perspective of sensuality through bass and groove and further described elsewhere as [my] take on an adult video from the 70s package comprises three original tracks and five edits over two 12-inches originals kick off with a characteristically jazzy 16-minute opus that winds freeform sax and keys around a wah-wah synth pattern and pitter-patter bongos and ts are shorter but mine similar territory the former a slightly spacier but still fast-paced jazz voyage the latter an excitable collision of flutes and whirring percussion of the edits and are the pick of a wonderful and varied bunch former takes a melodious croaking bassline and deep drums as its starting point before adding more sparkling brass and major force-esque atmospheric touches latter is a superb disco/soul edit with a honey-fried female vocal and a classic disco backing jaunty spanish guitar of sighing flutes of and the grin-inducing jazz workout of dy complete a highly desirable package from an always-vital artist
for most of his musical career patrick holland has been a talented follower first as 8prn he synthesized various strains of bass music from his hometown of vancouver into something colourful and capable then he became and dipped his toes into house music first with the easygoing chicago-style stuff and then with the citys emerging house sound (as pushed by the likes of pender street steppers and local artist) each new ep has built on the last and sure enough his latest is the clearest showcase of his talents yet arriving on his new label (named for the street where he now lives in montr al) could very well be hollands breakout record these tracks arent dealing with anything new fans of last years i want to believe wont be surprised or disappointed as always hollands basslines are head-turning and they sound better than ever here like the big buoyant one that drives with its crisp drums warm keys and synths that sound like guitars the track could be a mood hut band playing live at a bbq good luck trying to get that spritely topline out of your head hollands sound still owes a lot to his hometown but hes found new ways to own it the glassy adult contemporary textures on are all his own even the labels name seems like an attempt to assert a new place and time for it cant be a coincidence that this record lands in june just as montreal fully breaks out of its harsh winter and feel like sunlight taking over while the plaintive title track with its absent-minded guitar licks (courtesy of noni wos rory seydel) is a jam for an overheated afternoon its the sound of holland setting himself apart moving from vancouvers beaches and rainforests to montr als lush shadow of mont and the vibrant patios of little italy
along with his own dimensional exploration releases the past two years have seen swedish producer appear on respected techno labels like northern electronics tresor field records and clan destine as came to a close he linked up with svrecas semantica to put out an ep with four variations on his usual style: deep percussive techno there are no big changes to his template here if anything the tracks whose titles reference norse mythology are a little more uniform each is an unfussy 4/4 cut geared for dj use starts things on an intimidating note thanks to a thick fuzzy bassline that grinds its way high into the mix and are both sparser which leaves extra room for s misty atmospheres the former makes use of syncopated mid-range percussion as it dips into a calming haze while the latter with its rolling drums and layers of tense drones goes for a frantic vibe the more than eight-minute long packs a bristling low-end beeping bits of melody and a low-key but potent breakdown it winds up as an airy conclusion to another rock-solid ep from
its been a wait between innings for these two to combine forces once again the last soul interactive twelve (riddem control / da warrior) graced the shelves way back in 2000 and was a mighty house weapon for many a dj one would wager go dig it out again and you might well agree these two new cuts embark on much the same formula perhaps inching toward deeper and trippier territory there s plenty of soul and funk in feel it with a hypnotic repetitive bassline that would throb happily away in the early part of the night perhaps that s where it rightly belongs because it does little else than throb on and on sum bizzniss has got more hop to it there s a lovely shuffly drum pattern that picks up a gear and a short vocal loop over the top of some nice techy effects again this tune would work well as a nice building block in getting the crew moving its downbeat and a little spacey with a nice solid groove definitely the pick of the twelve dare i say we should expect more from these two
is a clear lesson in why artists start their own labels s newest 12-inch only nominally sounds like the perception that his name garners among house and techno fans its tech house kinda minimal a bit theres probably even a case to be made for techno too ut most of all is deliriously strange a leap away from the relatively straight rolling tech that he has come to be known for the title track for instance has polyrhythmic clapping underpinning the beat giving the tune an organic feel before microsound processing places you directly into the present day its a bit of a jungle inside but squillace keeps his eyes on the dance floor at all times losing sight of neither the forest nor the trees might be even better opening things up a bit to make room for a what sounds like a shimmering flute melody warm-up fodder no doubt but remarkably idiosyncratic stuff at the same time digital exclusive is a skip to these ears but itll likely have more dance floor utility than the other two combined thats because it sees squillace return to the safety of the immaculately produced/incredibly polite in other words it likely would have found a nice place on a different label i hesitate to offer advice of this sort to anyone but perhaps further indulgences on will be prove to be a very good thing
released in 1996 s n for papa might not have had the ubiquity of goldies less or reprazents ms but it had something many other drum bass albums of the era were sorely lacking: a sense of humour which could well be why it was roundly ignored by a drum bass scene who seemed able to stomach any number of over-egged double albums from the likes of grooverider and 4 hero but couldnt countenance anyone who sounded like they were actually having a laugh particularly if said prankster was a man luke vibert otherwise known for producing oddball electronica t that was necessarily a joke vibert might have treated drum bass with irreverence but it wasnt an outright piss-take of the sort later plied by many in the breakcore scene his breakbeats were as sophisticated as anything being put out on full cycle or talking loud its just that vibert was underpinning kitsch loungecore and easy listening samples as opposed to the more de rigeur jazz or ragga influences wadays though n for papa doesnt feel as dulled by over-familiarity as other 90s drum bass does today a collection of lost tracks from 1995 to 1998 now being released on viberts current home feels less like opening a time capsule than a new box of conjuring tricks e which could belong to say daedelus as much as viberts professional magician grandfather whose photograph adorns the cover tracks like with its waltzing organ coiled around frenetic breaks was a clear precursor to the californian beatsmith the most part viberts approach to drum bass still sounds unique although there are some signs that this was produced in the 90s if youre looking for them the sitars of for a shot were clearly borrowed from the indian-influenced drum bass scene that spawned talvin singh theres a touch of lex reece in the jazzy drum programming of and viberts disguise really slips on the tongue-in-cheek sampledelia of which could have fallen off the back of 1994s debut wagon christ lp throbbing pouch what absolutely none of it sounds like is anything someone like ndy c would ever play the closest ever comes to a roller is the track n but even then he careens all over the shop: the initial tear-out slowing into clipped half-step before skidding through time-stretched breakbeats 15 years since n for papa might now claim to be but he still remains completely out of line
standout five track spaced-out techno ep here by romanian artist who has also recorded for deejay gigolo and traum schallplatten with regular gigs at the krystal club in bucharest and throughout europe s flexes his strongarm with explosive techno acid punk and industrial style inspired by isaac asimovs 1950s science fiction series foundation he attempts to retell the classic tale with a straightforward assault of the senses that conveys all the determined strengths of the techno genre it all starts out with where a flat beat is accompanied by pogo-ing rubbery electronics and stabbing percussion the cut unexpectedly builds with overdubbed deep bass an element often lacking in electroish techno while of continues the menacing vibe with layered energy that breaks midway through into dj garth-inspired acid the layered chords sound like the classic r s material such as juan atkins model 500 work particularly on tazenda and interlude which are ambient pieces that segue into the real banging beast of the bunch while a lot of this is not innovative or a step in a new direction proves that classic techno made with heart and soul can still sound vital

appleblim and october are two key figures in bristols electronic music scene both of whom are arguably more recognized for their behind-the-scenes action and curatorial skills than their own production careers perhaps unfairly theyve also been proponents for the undercurrent of house and techno running deep underneath the citys dub currents a collaboration between the two seems like a natural occurrence then but the result the debut of new bristol collab-focused label is neither as polite nor as orthodox as you might glean from appleblims recent mixes or octobers history of continental techno influence z is the more accessible of the two but its highs are oddly smudged as if something nasty and viscous were spilled all over the mixing board charging forward on a dominating and weighty kick pattern thats broken just slightly to give the track a curious limp builds up unconventional pressure and unexpected momentum as it hobbles along propped up by piano chords that turn the track into some nightmarish vision of masters at work on the other side the even weirder of plays out like dbridge trapped in the basement the crawling analogue basslines smothering the lower reaches as synths ring out mournfully a sleek metallic 2-step beat emerges but the beat stutters stumbles and drags an almost distracting rhythm that renders the track more frustrating than interesting while the collaboration might appear logical it fulfills the labels self-proclaimed mission for unusual results for better or for worse
the problem with writing about releases is that theyre all kind of similar i mean that in a positive and negative way of late dam eyers imprint has channelled a very specific sound an attribute which is both its greatest strength and weakness to repeat myself ; loops insistent percussion and bold low end with her label debut fledgling producer doesnt challenge the status quo is certainly well-produced will work a dance floor and slots nicely into the canon but it lacks any real spark meanwhile samples the vocal from sun ras 1974 track space is the place it manages to stand out a little better employing a grand pad which sweeps dramatically over highly rhythmic percussion engberg maintains interest by means of bass subtraction and addition theres little to say past that unfortunately
will mitchell is part of milwaukees small but fertile dance music scene his boyfriends label close up of serene is also based there mitchell has released two solid eps on the label along with a barnstorming remix of chants for astral plane recordings mitchells third solo record released on dublins promising channels the energy of that remix into his strongest record yet simple ingenuity made mitchells remix of chants silencer magpie effective he twisted the power of breaks into a jungle homage before slowing them down into a half-time breakdown that felt totally modern is most impressive in such moments of fusion take the hard techno thump of where the breaks are time-stretched to fit with the 4/4 kick and zany acid lines shriek and squiggle like a power vacuum record on mitchell pairs breaks with jazzy deep house chords while the funky title track features rich synths focussing on classic breaks might seem derivative but mitchells approach is skilled and loving he invites you to savour the breaks as he highlights their sounds and textures se spacious arrangements are welcome in an emerging experimental club music world that embraces chaos and violence with plenty of variety too is the sound of a young artist putting his own spin on classic ideas
a couple of years ago the guardian wrote tongue slightly in cheek about the advent of the sad banger sam richards was describing the introspective electronic music of james blake and others but for whatever reason this phrase came to mind when listening to the debut of rish producer as a crunchy house ep it doesnt have much in common with the artists in that article but in its velvety pads and understated melodies the tone is brooding mall s remix of struck me for how easygoing it was compared to the other tracks the australian producer rearranges blancos moody original into a leaner breezier house cut the rest of is more worn down which can be a strength the sound of a creaking hinge becomes a rhythm that bounces alongside chopped-up funk on a track whose rusty sounds have a thrown together charm on the other two tracks blancos pensive atmospheres take precedence which is less convincing and are by no means bad the formers ethereal synth tones are more than capable of creating a dance floor moment but they suffer from overfamiliarity blancos chord sequences on and the choral synths of in particular generically express melancholy the dark side of keeps blancos personality from shining through
back in october daniel martin-mccormick dropped his latest release as ital the tense and wiry two-tracker throbbing through his own imprint now he seeks out more meditative environs for the label with s ep is a longtime alias of jacob long a san francisco artist who played bass in martin-mccormicks group mi ami and is the projects first full vinyl release with four tracks on wax and two digital extras and a total running time close to 50 minutes is a lengthy trip through ambient-ish techno soundscapes each of the rhythmic tracks wanders about with bpms in the low 120s the a-side cuts are busier with steadily building up a reverberated clatter and anchored by a kick drum that alternately fades away and sharpens into focus the record blurs further into abstraction on the flip sees long emphasizing a kick that lightly stamps out an uneven trail beneath increasingly strained rattling atmospherics eschews beats entirely with chiming bells that dissolve into pools of warm melancholy tones the two digital tracks have similar approaches to those on the vinyl sea of neptune offers more airy harmonized drones and another roaming kick drum while the beat-less floating sees long take one last dive into sub-aquatic ambiance might feel a bit aimless at times but that seems to be the point those who dig electronic musics softer more introspective pathways will likely be delighted with this one
there seemed to be a lot more attention paid to records at the time of their release last year than on year end charts and the like elephant s parade and inca both caught a lot of mention early in the year but quickly seemed to fade from view maybe it was a change in fashion or in tastes or maybe other breakthrough artists who were more memorable stole their thunder but whatever the cause it s good to have yet another slab of techno made with characteristic artifice from the swedish duo the side is a deadly cut leaden bass and a bit of spare ambient noise are driven by a drum workout that starts well and only gets better y about two thirds of the way in at about the six minute mark the drum work has taken on its own gravity pulling the listener forward in an irresistibly physical way calling this one a toe tapper is on the right track but a thousand times an understatement the side is altogether more peaceful t the core of the track is a warm and pretty bass riff which lets a bit of house feeling shine through its windows oth sides are an example of why the tinge of neo trance that infects every cocoon record these days is such a good thing these tracks make you feel good without taking any pains to look cool about it the collaboration between and cocoon is set to continue in the form of an album out next month i hope it s as good as this
when producers who dj get big on the touring circuit they usually have less time to make music its a nearly unavoidable byproduct of success as a dj is busier than ever and he hasnt released a solo record in three years only completing a handful of remixes it makes the unceremonious drop of his new 12-inch feel significant there are four new original tracks all of them in that inimitable dettmann style: steely and distant with a glimmer of something shiny to keep you captivated maybe new isnt entirely accurate astute techno heads will recognize from ben klocks berghain 04 mix where it was called rohd and credited to the alias act (that also explains this versions 2010 edit tag ) whatever its origins bangs with its moreish swung drum pattern and a killer chord progression that lights up the otherwise skeletal track the other three cuts are obsidian tools is the best a slice of classic ostgut ton-style techno its ultra-minimal the hook being in the rigid rhythm itself instead of the high-pitched ringing in the background is a brief piece of rumbling engine room ambiance while is a subaquatic groove with a hint of dub and some vaguely tribal drums both are built with stellar production values that belie their murky atmospheres none of these tracks compete for your attention but like dettmanns best work theyre loaded with depth and detail
s love of electro has been known since he began playing records in public while the dutchmans early productions on nn imee delsin and field records skewed toward techno his club sets have always been stacked with obscure electro reflecting years of dedicated digging the style didnt really pop up in his discography until traces his debut full-length half-techno half-electro the album was a snapshot of an artist caught between two worlds showcasing the broad range of his taste s fledging label is a completely different story its electro through and through a vehicle for its founder to throw himself into a style of music hed previously kept at arms length s latest effort is its most significant outing yet: titled its a four-part ep series produced by theres a fictional backstory that i wont fully delve into here (basically is the name of a mysterious planet and the music across the eps represents the auditory data recorded on s journey towards it) but the music speaks for itself its a strain of electro not particularly rooted in classics theres a techno drive across galaxy and which makes each cut especially floor-ready sounds best when the mood is dark which is the case with on i and on ii they feel more like songs than dj tools despite each being clearly functional the other tracks are driving and rough around the edges particularly and overall the first two installments of make for a solid showing from and a solid option for house and techno jocks looking to add some electro flair to their sets
interface sounds notifications from devices or even the sound of household appliances this is the ambient music that we live with says joe williams by way of explaining his latest album as williams tries to respond to our technological reality in the way that kraftwerk and yellow magic orchestra did theirs: by turning it into pop music of course hes not alone in this contemporary music has presented our hyper-connected present in various ways: as a place of chaos and disjunction; as a tacky corporate playground; as a frictionless cyberspace through which we drift williams achievement is to fold all of these conflicting perspectives into a coherent whole and to make that whole sleek and endlessly listenable this isnt williams first full-length in the mid-2000s he was making glam-tinged indie as white williams the ingredients of his reinvention can be found in a few recent side projects he worked on lifteds 2015 lp of strange and meditative synth music he has co-production credits on albums by his old friend co la whose splintered collages respond to the internet age in their own way and he has recorded mixtapes packed with exotica and leftfield japanese pop brass mechanics a future times single released alongside this album uses hyper-realistic software instruments to take the repeating figures of philip glass into post-human zones these influences and approaches are brought into careful equilibrium on the album imagines pop as computer-generated architecture: vivid plastic and physics-defying drums clatter and tumble with infinitesimal precision melodies are sprayed out in pointillist shapes synthetic strings and brass flex and bend oddly each track is difficult to parse in one or even three listens but this density isnt uncomfortable as it can be with co la the mood is beatific as if everything is unfolding according to a divine logic ( heaven sent the gui williams sings on ) several tracks are built around tranquil chord progressions adapted from the ryuichi sakamoto playbook and williams voice is a calming presence delivering inscrutable metaphors in a light tenor the most interesting stuff happens near the albums midpoint theres something footwork-y about the skittering rhythms of and though williams keeps the focus off the drums cloaking the tracks in woodwinds or a gorgeous robot choir on his voice takes on an autotuned sheen behind swelling strings lights accelerate / rendering a time zone / moving in a mobile home he mumbles in the synthetic haze on one level you cant work out what hes getting at but on another he seems to have captured something you were thinking all along
with possibly the sexiest techno record of (so far) wings of death under his belt and some decent work for lectroluv and tsuba has had a good year i like love triangle so i wanted his latest and to be good but like the rolling stones said the original mix is cute the bassline is taken from catchy pop 101 and despite sounding too much like a mylo record it still couldve been a fun tune unfortunately it doesnt break the confines of its groove leaving you wondering what else is going to happen the answer is not much it stays the course straight to dulltown i thought williams might save this release but he seems to have gotten caught up in this forget-neo-trance-im-just-making-trance revival williams combines the original mix with a flavourless predictable trance melody that wouldve made you shudder ten years ago and things really havent changed all that much on the b-side is which is a floppy grooving tech-houser that is better than the title track its cool for a warm-up or lounge and will probably have more longevity than and this isnt eeprom or williams at their best you wont hear anything new but if predictable music is your thing get on this now
is the most recent collaborative project from nu-discos sultry british songstress kathy diamond back in 2007 she released (under afro-house maestro maurice fultons patronage) a shiny yet subdued album for permanent vacation but since then her most iconic moments have been guest vocal spots on little gems such as aeroplanes whispers kaines saves the day or mario vidis in my system this time around she has befriended polish producer maximilian skiba mostly known for his teutonic tech-house 12-inches for boxer recordings together as (get it ) they create the kind of non-ironic lets-slap-that-bass-like-there-is-no-tomorrow disco that isnt nu or old just slightly dated and timeless at the same time much of falls into the middle-of-the-disco-dance-floor category on which the tempo is never amped up enough to fully lose yourself this is displayed on various songs such as somethings eatin and is which would all be rather inconsequential if it wasnt for diamonds appearances which save the day thanks to her quirky vocal inclinations thankfully there are enough moments to make the trip worthwhile s blend of piano-led melody and frenetic cowbells or the strings fest that feverishly closes are hard not to succumb to just like main single with its uplifting chorus (even included is the morgan version as an extra cut which adds a more upbeat feel to the tracks original brilliance) has a more percussive slightly tribal vibe while is an off-kilter slo-motion house number based on lethargic handclaps fake strings and subtle organs despite its somber allure and slower tempo it remains the albums most accomplished and exhilarating six minutes even though it cant do away with the fact more kink and more drama would have been more than welcomed overall
nearly every year releases a new track as if gently reminding us that hes still around its usually dependable workhorse stuff made from a tried-and-tested recipe of vocal samples acid lines and dramatic breakdowns sticks to the formula but it colours outside the lines a little not only does it come out through instead of winks ovum label but its unusually whimsical channeling the spirit of his early work more than even-keeled tracks like last years denial is winks best track in recent memory the original and the acid instrumental find the producer at full tilt the acid line sputters and sprays wildly while the drums switch patterns and pound indiscriminately like a toddler having a temper tantrum (the pitched-down vocal sample however is somewhat regrettable ) take out the acid line and the glitzy arpeggio grounding and it almost sounds like a hessle audio track thats why the stripped-back instrumental unexpectedly steals the spotlight by removing the 303 and letting the drums speak for themselves you can hear what an inspired and fun tune is at its core truncate provides a sharp makeover giving the track an unfussy techno pulse that starts stops and reinforces in all the right places a nearly nine-minute effort by mono gets trippy and unsheathes the tracks brutal acid line both are solid enough remixes that turn a livewire jam into something more straight-laced which only underlines the mercurial brilliance of
its rare that a rerelease sounds so aligned with current trends but s originally released in 1998 could appear in a mix of new music without anyone batting an eyelid one of only three tracks the tribal house duo ever produced was discovered on youtube by fade to mind producer total who recognised the affinity between the originals dance floor logic and his labels own output a sample ripped from a voicemail message is at the heart of the line i just thought id call before i throw myself into the icy lake is threaded throughout the track until it takes on a cyborg-like quality a glassy synth and barrage of clicking percussion which are are oddly prescient of eski grime ratchet up the tension until the track feels like a coil ready to spring and spring it does into a deadly groove dotted with ominous phone rings dazzling synths and drum hits that feel like a kick to the chest l-vis takes on twice his first remix makes scant use of the melody and phone rings so that when they do appear from beneath the sub-bass and serrated percussion theyre eerier than ever his fire alarm remix is even more uncompromising all piercing alarm tones and rapid-fire percussion the smooth vocal line and synth motif total adds do little to temper the prevailing brutality of his techno version na of nguzunguzu and rashad recast as a roiling footwork stomper crucially these remixes do nothing so trite as bring up to date instead reinforcing just how contemporary it still sounds

perc and randomer are two uk artists who approach making bangers from different angles the former real name ali wells puts noisy power behind industrial techno while the latter rohan walder is on a roll with his dense production work earlier this year the two presented their styles side-by-side on s stowaway remixed now theyve gone one further for the label with a full-blown joint release is three ripping techno tracks that are as heavy as youd expect its not hard to imagine this record being influenced by a back-alley brawl: the sounds are rough and delivered with a masculine aggression that shows both producers swinging hard the title track easily the best thing here is perc in texture but randomer in shape with garbled pads and fiercely jagged rhythms barreling across an industrial core is more predictable with breaks and stabs that add some edge to an otherwise routine techno-zombie stomp on things start out electrifying become pulverizing and then as the textures become shrill and tangled end up a bit of a mess these artists both do chaos well but together they seem a little too eager to just bash and destroy

amsterdam is a key node in the new global ambient network one of the artists behind this extended ep suzanne kraft moved there from la and hes been working with the citys label since 2015 kraft and the labels founder jonny nash collaborated on the recent passive aggressive lp while nash has worked with gigi masin in the group gaussian curve the older masin who can thank the local label music from memory for his recent comeback helped develop the blueprint for the citys blissed-out sound calm unfussy assemblages of piano guitar or translucent synth these tracks are often as tranquil as a sunlit lagoon but theyre not aimless under the surface subtle pop currents steer things the latest record a collaboration between kraft and d k (part of the similarly minded crew around pariss antinote label) makes clever use of these currents offers the clearest direction for starters it has drums along with graceful daubs of cymbal and a tangy snare its elegant melodies play off a deft bassline the movements get subtler elsewhere and you have to float in the musics amniotic warmth for a while before you notice yourself tugged this way or that the direction on comes from a smooth but firm bassline which sets the scene for dramatic piano and guitar licks on blow its sizzly synth pads rippling through the track to a gentle rhythm the records second half enters murkier waters mans opens with an edge of unease though after two minutes its bathed in a rosy glow on a silken arp slips in almost unnoticed softening a twilit landscape through which piano lines echo like ghosts betrays the masin influence most of all with a sentimental three-chord progression that starts in the bassline before migrating upwards like a lot of this amsterdam music it wouldnt disturb the middle-aged gents in the sauna of my local gym
stars of the olympics opening ceremony until a year ago it would have been hard to think of a less likely sentence but when surf solar olympians and sundowner (by benjamin powers blanck mass side-project) rang out during danny boyles set-piece in london last july it felt apt: epic hopeful uncompromising music for an event that against all the odds merited the same description surf solar and olympians from 2009s andrew weatherall-produced tarot sport album were major markers of fully finding the sound we now associate them with: monolithic sheets of noise shot through with otherworldly melodies that winning combination is unsurprisingly in evidence again on benjamin power and andrew hungs first self-produced album that said there are differences and points of progression a more foreboding atmosphere a broader palette of sounds and instrumentation that prevent it from feeling like a retread is a jaw-dropping opener waves of noise and a raw analogue drum track quickly usher it to lift-off whereupon it explodes with a snarling vocal loop into a truly pulverising howl with its synth chimes (a trademark) and woozy bass drones recalls some of the more regal moments on tarot sport recent single finds the pairs crescendo-building mastery in rude health its chugging beginnings gradually coaxed to a patiently euphoric climax may be darkest moment to date with a doom-laced vocal loop wrapping itself around crepuscular keys and bass while album closer goes for the emotional jugular its high keys and widescreen atmospherics recalling olympians y cant all be apocalypse-heralding monsters; and princes while interesting function mostly as buffers between the main events res nothing wrong with that but these tracks probably wont be the reason people return to this record again and again return to it they will though because is more often than not an olympic-standard piece of work

s early success he has said was partly down to his naivety the albums plastic world and black square were suffused with the freewheeling excitement of an artist coming to dance music relatively fresh its probably safe to assume that as he has become more experienced his job has become harder following those albums a string of eps probed more specific sounds or ideas: 2012s spartan unknown 2 ; the hyperactive glimmer of last years hummingbird ; the recent iv which explored darker foggier textures s first release with is a larger statement than all of those across six tracks it roams from gauzy ambience ( ) to dark tunnel-vision techno (the engrossing ) but with the exception of the bolder it once again sees homing in on a single subtle idea in this instance seems intent on breaking down his abstracted bedroom techno to its smallest elements: clouds of particles dancing in time to a submerged rhythm sometimes the results are unsatisfying in particular piles on layer after layer of material feeling busy but uneventful in a manner similar to pattens recent work but when throws one of his aphex-style melodies into the mix things come together nicely draws satisfyingly into focus in its closing minute; is positively uplifting a rare moment of velocity from an artist more concerned with dropping out than tuning in
lpha and y o u r o c k both turn up just a little before the halfway mark on s m megamix where they serve as sunny peaks before the mix corkscrews darkly down a succession of hairpin turns or partly sunny anyway: y o u r o c k starts out with chipper almost kitschy vocal harmonies over a crisp disco stomp but storm clouds soon arrive in the form of sullen square-wave bass and errant squeal with a haywire feel thats vaguely reminiscent of c++s ngies fucked lpha on the other hand is all ice cream and smiles conjuring new wave at its dreamiest via strummed guitars chiming dx7s gated snares and the kind of fizzy neon haze familiar from acts like washed out and cfcf s for the lps darker back half its represented here by a dubby techno-disco maelstrom in the vein of maurice fulton its here that s skills as a sound designer really shine as he yokes together acoustic electric electronic and digital timbres into a gelatinous mass flecked with crystal facets

has been moving in directions i dont think many could have predicted and its a mixed blessing while the erlin producer continues to be associated with a particularly forceful industrial style (the epitome of the erghain sound almost cliched at this point) his 0 0 output wasnt really faithful to that stereotype his album saw him craft an hour of painstaking home-listening techno there was a near-ambient track on the funf compilation and you had a slew of unpredictable and inconsistent remixes (good: his remix of traversable wormholes closed timelike curve ; commixs satellite type not so much) kontra-mokira-mixes marks dettmanns first original release on the always-intriguing label and it comes armed with faux-conceptual gravitas dettmann constructed both of these s out of elements of swedish producer mokira wait isnt that just an unnecessarily elaborate way of saying remix regardless part is a slippery dub techno track and while the sub frequencies that toss and turn underneath are a nice enough foundation the bored progression and floaty chords are impersonal and detachedly dull part redeems its lackluster flipside as suppressed kicks stumble in a skewed - step attempting to break through the curtain of artificial fog the clouds part a few centimetres enough to let some hi-hats hiss their way in and the track simmers with the impeccable sound design expected but it still pales in comparison to something like viscous or any other number closer to dettmanns most accomplished work
big room techno bangers need hooks s the b1 of s recent phasing faces vol 1 compilation has a few it features the kind of bassline you mightve heard on a tech house track from the late 00s making it too cheesy for some selectors and dance floor gold for others its paired with a squiggling synth and a simple drum pattern that gives way to an early breakdown about one third through the intensity increases from there the track builds up once the beat returns finding a sweet spot where the bassline synchronises with a big snare and a triplet of bleeps if hands werent already in the air they are now the rest of the ep is more subdued s is a murky tool with a heaving low end claps and a pitched down vocal d vides and s are more sentimental their grooves are straightforward but long synth notes add a melancholic touch absent from the other tracks all three tunes are solid options for djs but its hard to beat s well crafted intensity expect to hear it during the upcoming festival season
tadd mullinix dons his acid house guise james t cotton for this latest release on titled it s a bison of an offering featuring three dark chicago acid inspired numbers ready to shock and amaze with the austere of an eagle-eyed vortex all three tracks on this release really pick up on those chicago vibes and one can easily visualise the warehouse type response this music was generated for electronically produced but with human traces all over it spectral illustrates its commitment to quality music; the label again showing both depth and control first up is the strong minded with intent which goes for that chicago bumpty-bump bass beat production with sneering hi-hats and short melody this will definitely capture the dancefloor and take people deeper into a cinematic epic caught abusing ketamine some sinister vocals give this deep dirty chicago inspired acid-induced number a somewhat jaded sound but all the production elements are complex and precise never tired sounding or fractured my zel starts with short rolling beats and a sinister build up that eventually construct into the lead sample whistling its way around the production again this is very chicago both in its construction and its use of melody the final offering is t-y-o-c-painkillers (2am_fm rmx) it gets grinding with a post-industrial introduction which unfolds into a lead synth melody that rolls and swings through the track with ease is definitely the main number here but all the tracks on offer should sit well with the likes of troy pierce or even derrick may juan atkins and kevin saunderson all three pieces have a really late night feel (suitable for peak time or for after parties) and complex production surrounded by warbles synths hi-hats and electronic programming the tracks have a lot of energy yet do not sound rushed or over produced and skillfully reference early detroit techno and chicago grooves james t cotton might sound average as a name but his music most certainly is not
a pulsating album from the birmingham boys realising the potential shown over the past few years in their remixes of moby underworld and the chemical brothers not to mention the cuts sparc and frequency both included here the opening trio of pumping electro-house tracks are razor sharp - statikman a house/trance hybrid another hit dark and robotic and late at night sounding like gary numan taken on a joy ride the downtempo excursion that follows is also effective although they go just a bit too dirty vegas on recent single on my mind this is a minor quibble though as the pace and intensity pick up once more with sparc the booming satellite and birdcage crucially the album is just the right length and by the time you get to the end you wont be so worried about that leftfield split buy this monster
soren jahans work as takes a starkly different tack from the deep house he makes as one half of b-tracks scan through tracklists of mixes hes given away over the past year or so provides a good perspective on the influences hes drawing from: they heavily feature stripped-back dubby material from labels like perlon force tracks basic channel and maurizio nd last years well-received pechorin album meshed together ideas from minimal house and dub techno in a way that felt distinctly contemporary managing to avoid the trap of re-treading well-worn old ground this follow-up 2-inch is the second release on jahans own label (following a very solid debut outing that gathered four unknown producers) and finds his balance shifting further towards straight-up minimal house its done with real flair: each of the two tracks here unravels over 2-plus minutes but they remain fascinating throughout jahan is skilled at blending his sounds together in such a way that its tough to pick any one element from the fray the bulk of the melodic heft of pt is contained within a breathy pipe melody but its always eroding away at the edges into greyscale synth drones and what sound like the strains of a sunken choir is noisier and rather more sinister its clatter of incidental sound prickling at the edges of perception and recalling the paranoia of ricardo villalobos strangest work
next up on paolo mojo s label is a production by argentinean born ricky ryan under his alias with a track by the name of who cares the original mix is plain a simple a very good production a simple enough 4/4 beat pattern holds the production alongside some nice progressive synths and effects while the baseline works its subtle magic in the background there is a nice and cheeky little breakdown in the middle which sees the baseline really take control and from then on normal business is resumed smight s special place remix is on the flip and as usual he offers a very unique insight the beats are quite sparse and quirky and the effects from the original ring in and out of the production the baseline is nice and chunky in the track and really plays a vital role another good remix by smight and a great and unique addition to the more club friendly original there are a lot of good releases out there at the moment and this is definitely one of them 2 very solid productions on a label that does its thing ever so well
artwork from by calum macrae aka shows two images in one young people clamber over a car and upturned concrete as they approach a whirlwind other is a meteorological diagram of that same whirlwind with arrows illustrating the wind flow in a similar vein you could absorb macraes music one of two ways: with awe at its emotional force or with fascination at what makes it work underneath distended beats and tonal spasms that recall autechre and aphex twin vocal collages and synth melodies glow softly music full of displaced drums and vocals sounds like its trying to escape itself restraints are particularly tight on in which vowels drums and synths stutter in jump cut-style progressions that energy turns inward on where strobing noise and choral melodies occupy opposing corners mediated by weeping synths if last years skeletal glasz ep foregrounded the knots and acute angles of macraes music then examines opposing moods and textures its optimism versus melancholy organic versus synthetic uk club styles on glasz survive on say s pastoral grime synths but the feeling across macraes latest ep is more elated s tuned bass drums pump against angelic tones in the style of aphex twins syro in the vocals and strings of macraes music is at its most transcendent but the sense that things could turn awry is never far away
has a cult following and its not just because of his notorious internet persona at surface level the appeal is obvious: his beats pair crystal-clear melodies with hard-hitting percussion and his best tunes dont have more than three or four parts to them but theres something bewitching about the way he puts sounds together and thats what captures the hearts of so many 2011s dedication saw him at his most funereal and trudges its hearse down the same route two discs of frigid and lonely computer music the sprawling record presents at his best but also his most fragmented though is s most substantial statement its building blocks are as brittle as ever songs rarely make it beyond the three-minute mark and many fade out suddenly as if he got bored while making them more than ever before hes established a core sound palette high-pitched trills tinny drums ominous strings expanding on the bleakness of dedication but slimming down his toolbox in the process everything has a neo-gothic sheen like its set against a stark black background minimalist and sleek at times its so uniform that its hard to tell songs apart disc one suffers less from this problem connecting the skeletal pallor of s new music back to the irreverent rave spirit of where were u in 92 he jumps from gorgeous chiptune ( as darkness falls ) to straight-up jungle ( overdose ) and of course his signature brand of neon-lit eski grime lightweight but hard like titanium ( pray for me ) its a jumpy listen but its all clothed in the same grey melancholy even the few tracks with vocal samples ( the things you do if i will ) feel soaked in formaldehyde their voices dead and distant most intriguing of all is when he delves into baroque trap stringing stuttering drums over curtains of regal melody trap (or something like it) ends up as the dominant sound of the more homogenous second disc the same grandly echoing drums skid through almost every track buffeting melodies that sound eerily familiar the disc climaxes with soliloquy which is easily s standout moment its central melody is slightly more fleshed-out its drum programming a tad more dynamic for an artist so intent on self-mythologizing with his grand pronouncements rare interviews and mask-wearing anonymity feels like a surprisingly comprehensive piece of work but its still a rambling outpouring of quick-fire songs it could be s magnum opus or just him getting lost in his own excess either way hes still doing exactly what he wants to and in a world of copycats and trend-hoppers that defiant attitude is a virtue in itself
rto mwamb has firmly established himself as the joker of the european house scene the difference is he doesnt drawl why so serious out of the side of his mouth instead he yells it with a beer in hand then falls over the decks as his lurid party house music blares well if he really was just one guy he might fter a recent gig at panorama bar we now know the fictional urkinab character was created by phillip lauer and christian eisswinger (c funk) who run along with thomas sabrowski (saap) ut theres good music to back up the jokes when you hear these tracks you may realise youd been sitting in an uncomfortable position during the last year or two of purist circlejerking thats seen producers and critics raging over who ejaculated first theres a lightness and fun to this music that suggests dance music doesnt have to look inward as much as it has been of late the track that you may know already here is its a record where mwamb brings the the party energy of fidget or electro to deep house that may sound repulsive to some but the result is still actually quite faithful to the pop spirit of early acid tracks mwamb loops an indistinguishable but catchy vocal over a fat imprecise bassline fading it into a weird but eupohric chorus of sounds without words the sloppiness is paradoxically perfect a study in the imperfection of swing its got more energy and colour than practically anything else released this year of course mwamb can also be serious when he wants to two on the flipside sees him in disco mode harking back to his first ep its a slow and clean groove with walking bassline and repeating house pads a lazy track in a good sense ll the attention will be for but this is still a skilled if wildly different companion we may know rtos true identity but his character is still vividly painted in these tracks
s debut artist album comes after what seems like a very long seven years releasing 1 s on labels like poker flat and spectral sound traum offshoot who put out his bork and endpoint tracks are again the man from the midwest s current troupe as samuel announces his arrival in the deep and often treacherous waters of long-player territory gap between an artist album and a stitched-together collection of singles is widening struggle to shift from 1 triumphs to a coherent lp has plagued many an artist and with electronic music moving forward conjuring up an album effort with the content that the format demands remains an important challenge so how does fare percolating bleeps and some tidy jackin beats on punchline in c++/ were the are as good a way as any to start: journeyman tech house with very nice touches that sets the mood for what s to come pays homage to etroit but also tells the story of the struggle of producing techno in the usa where all that glitters is not gold this is a fairly profound piece of work with samuel in contrast to his usual sprightly pace moving into broken beats to slow things down power ballad is another epic beauty moving away from 4/4 but propelling us onwards while has a more timeless feel reaching back to samuel s melodic techouse vogue not too unlike his bork track res depth and meaning in many places on : and just try (my personal favourite) are pure electronic tones untainted by modern complication yes the lack of grit and edge might bring complaints that this is armchair techno for late night loafers but samuel appears set on his own course away from murky club-infested waters in recent times tracks like gonadotrpin and middlepoint proved samuel knows a dark groove or two but is an album where he breathes life into his songwriting and shows a softer side the is a step forward with a trademark samuel bassline that finishes with the sublime refrain of i think they are trying to say something samuel has mentioned he tried to take his melodies as far as he could on this album and this last track is proof of success: the melody evolves over nine minutes never repeating itself an album in every sense of the word the tracks are unmixed but sequenced in a manner to suit the listener; theres no over-indulgence in dull minimal soundscape or excessively drum-led tracks - warm melodies and intriguing rhythms abound i got flashbacks to early deep stuff from ave angel when i heard : samuel has tightened up his production with strings songlike hooks and some bumpy bass action to provide a quality end result i enjoyed this album a refreshing break from dancefloor driven insanity if youre the kind of person who prefers a c which can be listened to as opposed to something that pounds out of your speakers might be for you an aptly titled journey this release definitely steps jeff up to another level and i think it will have many people talking about it for some time
for the most part shadowy duo have thrived on tightly coiled ritualistic arrangements deadly effective for leading listeners into mazes of tension but perhaps less enthralling come peaktime recently however theyve been exploring that latent energy their recent frozen border transmission uprising is a floor burner (for them) and these tracks for fifth installment absolutely follow suit as usual dont spend a lot of time with melody but no matter these are much more than drum tracks and their allure lies in how kinetic they manage to be opener mo o augments a surging groove with little rattles of organic percussion on the edges while the slippery charts a thrilling evolution through a sly maneuvering of hi hats most surprising is which breaks into an accordion led rush of baile funk halfway through have never been shy about their fondness for global sounds and the genres thunderous stepping bass drums fit remarkably well with their sound bleak closes proceedings with a remix of that solidifies his status as a skudge acolyte conforming the originals restless energy to a locked stab laden rigidly off balance groove technically s restless configurations are quite broken but they instinctively dip and swing like the most natural body music
its strange that in a genre like techno which strives more than most for a stringent economy of means (bordering at times on ascetic) to call something tool-like is mildly derogatory its as if to say this track is too economical; res not enough of it or some such like but res an art to making techno which flirts with miscellany (if thats not too oxymoronic a way of putting it) and a brave producer that chooses to leave out all but bare necessities done effectively it makes for purest sort of dance floor gear and by proxy purest sort of raving which short of solving mind/body problem or even better ridding world of imbeciles is whole point right wirmeans is a prime example: its almost a tool insofar as mixed heavily with a fleshier number of a similar tone it works beautifully left bare and exposed however it sounds bloody good too a bleeping bone-hard 6 am roller replete with gut-punching kicks and skittering ice cold hats but no mid-range whatsoever like vulture-knawed skeleton of something once much beefier and all nastier for it that hails from renowned scottish hell-hole paisley makes total sense: this is lanky darkside techno par excellence is even better a lumbering stone carved tech house behemoth that plods along with a morose sort of funk like monolake and claro intelecto doing valium at a rave in portables basement and (somehow) getting a perfect front left stomp on the by comparison is manic flapping around like bastard child of naughties sheffield and noughties bristol all schizoid chords and jittery shuffling kicks its least cohesive of three pieces but also most exuberant capping off an unnervingly mature ep in tastefully rambunctious fashion

this semi split release on [nakedlunch] marks what the 90th instra:mental related release this year while it might seem like overkill its hard to complain when the results are always so satisfying is the first track in about two months and its a pleasing return compiling all the familiar elements into something that doesnt just sound like another retread of his tried and tested sound layering his usual drum machine patter on top of a bassline that climbs and climbs and climbs like some demented energizer bunny marks lex greens most natural flirtation with acid yet with the corrosion more implied than obvious the flipside is skudges remix of instra:mentals well loved one of the very last tracks released by the duo that still fit into their world of half awake twilight utonomia the swedish duo turn the originals sleepy whisper into a surprisingly jacking concoction rubbing the riff raw until its coarse and abrasive the slight coat of skudge does wonders for reviving an already well played track it might have taken a while for it to see the light of day in typical [nakedlunch] style but the results were worth the considerable wait
to say was a good year for would for anyone with even a passing interest in underground club music (or simply electronic music per se for that matter) be a strong contender for understatement of the year not content with releasing one of the best bass-oriented lps in recent memory he went on to set up his own label the first two releases of which have been thoroughly on point and perhaps most tellingly contributed the first fully utonomic mix to r s podcast series thats on top of maintaining one of the liveliest soundcloud pages around manning a consistently rewarding blog and generally bossing the post-d milieu alongside nonplus+ label-mates d ridge and instra:mental serious stuff happily s fifth release sees the california-dwelling man u fan continue to do exactly what hes done of late: namely his own thing which in this instance means a slower tempo than usual (140ish pm) and a healthy mix of spacey atmospherics and low-end punch is about as aggro as gets (which is actually pretty aggro) pounding swells of bass lurching up against razor-sharp half-step cracks and madcap robot bleeps a hectic whirl of frantic ruffage thats unlikely to please fans of his more restrained side (see aforementioned r cast) ut -side probably will gain the bass is the primary element but this time its soft and porous cocooning the listener in its buoyant 4/4 throb as clappy snares and tinkling hats play off against mellow pads and a gently broiling acid line every element perfectly at ease with its place in the bigger picture steeped in the sounds of early 90s techno and electronica this is as much simply music as much as it is club music and lush enveloping music at that ut as with so much of s output played on a proper rig its just plain big res simply no way you wont be hopping along as you admire the view
dexter and offer two radically different reworks of s and released last fall s was a lumbering cut modeled after early chicago house at its most skeletal but dexter flips the script entirely looping the titular phrase over a syncopated electro groove and turning the originals sullen shuffle into tremolo-soaked space funk k 2562 preserves the through-line of maintaining its murky bassline and funky mutterings but he completely rearranges the rhythm track swapping out the congas and sparse machine drumming for a snapping swinging garage-like groove sheds wax material comes to mind but this feels both more brooding and more bruising; between the atonal synths and the pitch-shifted spoken word it makes da funk sound like an almost hellish proposition
a debut on berlins highgrade represents a step up for andrea martello and giulio spagnuolo the italian duo behind lumin r they meet the challenge with aplomb; the basic template is a warm bath of deep house but subtle nuances take each of the tracks down their own individual paths is the trippy one with abrasive synths slashing across its duration as truncated drumrolls battle for supremacy with a broad-shouldered kick drum lumin rs softer side fares even better the soulful is washed in a steady trickle of ambient noise with huge rhodes chords shining a light across it sitting somewhere between the two lashes a breakbeat to wobbly synths that sound like theyve been tipped into a swimming pool lumin r do emotional house very well that they have the requisite control to prevent it becoming overwrought is to their credit

los ngeles experimental electronic artist has paid his dues from his long standing residency alongside gaslamp killer at renowned low end theory night producing beats rappers and leading shoegaze pop duo blank blue his musical path has led him through hip-hop electronica and psychedelica with his third long-player though he takes on his biggest challenge yet: uses most over-used studio ol around u -tune every track on album serves as a confessional nobody reflecting on troubled time in his life that ended his marriage if anyone has a reason let out pent-up emotion its nobody using u -tune hes managed say what hes needed say and also successfully walk tightrope between clever and gimmick opening with title track juxtaposes an undeniably pop-styled electronic beat against heartfelt lyrics from re though he commences on a psychedelic journey through hip-hop electronica and rock roll a with help from is most hip-hop-styled song on album albeit nestled against a dreamy backdrop traces bon iver with gorgeous acoustic guitars while lpha drifts languidly and rates as one of most beautiful tracks on with delicate use of au -tune complementing composition g with its fuzzy guitars and reversed drum loop sample sounds remarkably like a my bloody valentine record the highlights of come from its uptempo numbers though is a rough-and-ready dubstepper with organic drum samples and gritty guitars and apart from lpha its best use of au -tune on album if you can get past gratingly high pitched digital vocals is a excellent change of pace with a pop offering of down-pitched house garnished with jittery rhythms and metallic percussion is hardly a validation u -tune the album does its best however use it in a less irritating way than most occasionally seems resemble roger troutman but most part this lp delivers a swirling mix of dreamy psychedelic electronica that is as eclectic as his famed low end theory dj sets

always willing to please their supporters collect some of their high flyers into a single package in - an unmixed selection on cd which is getting big support from guys like sasha paul van dyk tiesto and armin van burren first up is alex stealthy with once (original dance mix) it starts off with a slow build of sustained organs and effected kicks that drops into a droning bassline and crisp snares layering is the name of the game here as loads of echoing and sinking synths set the emotive mood its done no better than in the breakdown where a tinny guitar-like melody plays out with the atmospherics as a squeezed grainy bassline adds punch keenan dale s drift away featuring endc brings in a little mood as subtle looped melodies roll alongside a simple bassline and futuristic swooping samples the sulky vocal keeps the gloom with smooth synths which works perfectly with the bassline and percussive drums things start to build towards the breakdown as the vocal goes up an octave and the synths become more prominent picking things up is ritmix from freza dj flash which sees a flurry of melodies with panning and echoing effects as a bouncy bassline adds groove a short stabbing electro synth gets things rolling accompanied by light cascading sounds and funky squelches as we arrive in the breakdown we are treated to the melodic goodness as constant rolling arrangements play over each other and create a nice climax when the beat comes back in andy moor gets his hands on yellow blackboard s superfly and turns in a tough but deep remix featuring a thrusting bassline with no bottom end and loads of floating synths and twinkling melodies the female vocal is sharp and it s cut up and effected feel is backed up with a matching melody an epic breakdown with simple melody patterns lead into some panning vocal madness and drops nicely back into the beat as the gritty bassline drives the track to the end able to forget from alex stealthy starts off solidly with slapping claps quirky samples and a rolling pulsating groove an echoing tinny melody is introduced which sets the sullen mood as the volume is brought up and down walsh coutre s done with love featuring holly is dubbed up by the seven sisters as a subtle drums and rasping snares assist a arpeggiated bassline the vocal is heavily filtered and echoes in and out of the foreground while light sounds flow smoothly behind the driving bass a walking animated melody is given loads of room to play in the breakdown with the main bassline and lifts the track up in the last half loads of main floor material here all in one nice package going from uplifting to deep and dark the productions are of high quality which you would expect from the sog label
fabric has finished off a hat-trick of top-shelf fabriclive releases with fabriclive 30 following up the maximal chunkiness on evil nine s 28 and cut copy s hipster electro-disco epic 29 the warriors have crafted the perfect example of what the fabriclive series stands for: set side-by-side (or month-by-month) to the fabric series it s about salty sleazy bonerific bodypopping from front to back as opposed to living room wallpaper mark yardley and dom butler prove themselves jacks of all trades and then some: their production compiling mixing remixing and trademark refixing skills all stand out on this stellar mix first things first: fabriclive 30 would get everyone nice n sweaty in da club the boys proffer a masterstroke right off mashing up kerri chandler s old-school electro planet sonic with spank rock s nu-skool ghettotech bump peace division s snide house track club therapy and claude vonstroke s minimal techno mischief-maker who s afraid of detroit make appearances after having featured on wiggle s fabric 28 and tiefschwarz s 29 respectively but here the warriors have gutted both and installed custom refix chrome: a beefy breakbeat and bigger buildups only make the songs better for wahoo s make em shake it the warriors mercifully slice out the original s reggaeton speed up the vocals and end up with what is arguably their best straight-ahead remix yet they then effortlessly combine two of their biggest tracks: twista s pop ya cork vocals over 2001 s da virus while the production sounds dated and twista doesn t have quite the same effect he did on the original it s still a novel idea seeing as how the tracks sync up so well despite a five-year age difference pop ya cork a stellar opening to april s stanton sessions vol 2 isn t the only track off that comp to get mashed up on fabriclive 30 the warriors grind their beatnuts collaboration shake it up over the jazzy beats from deekline ed solo s remix of busta rhymes touch it and toss a bit of still here featuring eska right in the middle of baobinga id s storming the machine elsewhere dom mark give king unique s to the left a chunky but fairly typical remix and just when you think it s over the splack pack pa announces shake that aaaaaaass bitch and let me see whatcha got it s that touch of class we can always count on from considering fabriclive 30 is the first through-and-through breaks comp in the series since meat katie s 21 it s worth comparing the two at the time meat katie turned in the same level of work as any dj in either of fabric s series: throwing in one original production ( nu-tron ) one remix (dylan rhymes salty ) and one mash-up (infusion s better world with unkle s reign ) between tracks from unknown producers and fellow labelmates but a year-and-a-half and nine installments later the bar has been significantly raised are easily the hardest-working dj duo in the biz right now: chopping tossing and reworking like there were 25 hours in the day they make a myriad of their own and others productions which have been played to death in the past year sound fresh as baby powder on a big booty the only major fault worth noting is that as always fabriclive 30 comes in a tiny tin box not booming out from fabric s floor-rattling speakers so for everyone who wasn t there the night rocked crotches in room one i sympathize
has a more celestial bent than his peers at berghain those tendencies came out in full on his excellent debut album fokus which landed on ostgut ton loaded with pretty melodies and appealing textures since then hes left the labels ranks was originally slated for release on ostgut ton before fengler announced his departure from the crew now its out on his own label index continuing its recent run of tough melodic techno the tracks on were created to be versatile the promo came with a note calling them an ideal companion whether youre pruning your bonsai or branching out a club set and while theyre not quite relaxed theyre bright and friendly the whirring organs on the title track for example are a sound you wouldnt have heard from the who mixed berghain 05 back in 2011 but also features a wonderfully muscular rhythm bolstered by some heavy low-end not to mention a catchy chord progression that wobbles through the whole thing is big on melody too its easy to mistake the roaring synth for a nils frahm sample and the way it looms over the tune like a tidal wave is something to behold like the tracks rhythm section is addictive and detailed making for emotional techno that doesnt sacrifice its dance floor potential has elegant drums that sound like theyre made of plastic and glass its not hard to see why fengler might have wanted a fresh start judging from hes got a fresh new sound

the first two albums s most recent compilation series were designed with hyperactive listeners in mind: they d switch genre and bpms at an add like pace but the overall effect was at times dizzying commissioning never released radio edits of already known tracks (e g a shorter and too immediate version of washing up on vol 2 ) and cramming them all together all but enhanced that nauseating feeling as if wanted you to have a taste of her label s recent developments but all in only one bite for the third installment of the series though she changed strategies and what you have here is 4 brand new tracks in slightly more dj friendly versions as well as a reminder of the berlin s label ever going relevance opening with kreuzberg s own (whose gets all syncopated ghetto on our asses in a way not dissimilar to m a s diplo enhanced sounds) vol then takes us to every corners of the contemporary dance music spectrum from pulsating (with welcome vocals) to s best sean impersonation ( feat ) from s serene to aptly titled s and there (are you really that lost guys ) after new offerings from and the album then ends on a gorgeous note with s pavillion a highly melodic and crisp follower to his own memorable gazebo nstead of simply contemplating its own recent past it appears the bpitch headmasters are now firmly looking forward to the label s bright upcoming future even though the songs still don t really have much more space to breathe (clocking at one hour the compilation is faithfully all about four minute mini anthems) the music on vol weirdly enough ends up having more time to shine

the -side of guillaume coutu dum ts latest is such a damned insistent groove its quite hard imagine how you might resist dancing it you might call this relentless funky house powered by chunky driving hi-hats and a punchy snare something like rhythmic brainwashing except that the beat is not speaking your brain at all s befitting any high-class body-mover dum ts number directly bypasses the cerebral cortex for some un-chaper ed quality time with the body the beat seems completely indifferent the c cerns of the listener: whether or not you like house music at all or dancing or if youre tired and want go home of all mr coutu dum ts recent output its thats the most directly fun friendly and cathartic which is saying a lot for such a clearly party-time invested individual then the vocal creeps in an extended m a sinner -style preacher sample over the mml ssgs blog a recent post was dedicated the recent uptick in such preach-a-pella tracks and how the use of preacher vocal samples jacked in deep houses two emoti al poles: joyous collective celebrati the e hand restless soul-searching the other ut the attracti of using a preacher sample isnt ly that its passi ate c fessi al intersects with reas s why people want get gether in a dark room and move around preachers voice is also a magnificent versatile instrument and guillaume puts it serious work here: it speaks but it also hums and sings rolls and wavers with stirring dynamic vibrati n the instrumental spaces the filtered oscillati s of the vaguely acidy synthesizer that floats over the drums seem not that dissimilar from the idiosyncratic warbles of human speech the preacher winds up his rollercoaster serm by calling out need some e deliver me which is kind of a w derfully paradoxical thing hear in a club where chances are youre doing at least e thing that your sunday schoolteacher would disapprove of ut thats always been the alluring danger of music in general e that dance music is pretty good at utilizing you can never completely make music in a therapeutic cure-all because its a drug no e can c trol so while youre hearing a self-proclaimed sinner urgently cry out for release at the same time beneath it youre getting an aural dose of something which may do the trick or it just may make things worse the flip cant rgue with is a much-minimized counterpart the big-b ed swivel-hipped -sider the drums themselves are chilled and passable with sixteenth note shakers and a clipped clap the beats job here is provide a restrained backdrop for the tracks centerpiece a fantastic deeply ethereal string secti with str g ndian-classical inflecti that wafts in and out like a lost ghost ts quietly counterbalanced by weird burbling ephemera that resemble cassette flutter and which reinforce the orchestras murky hauntingly imperfect fidelity a spectral emanati from some dark and distant plane
recording for labels like idle hands and horizontal ground is part of a new breed of techno producers committed to stark sounds and general anonymity and while such an approach isnt exactly unheard of in techno circles something about (formerly known as 19 26 1 18 5 which apparently rolled off the tongue a bit too easily for their liking) and associates feels particularly current if s latest for the upstart imprint is any indication what sets this sort of techno apart from berghain-style bangers the dark journeys of the italians or brittle meanderings a la scb is a willingness to move between all three impulses over the shifty playfulness of its beat a subtle effect that nevertheless gets your feet doing some pretty peculiar things at four tracks is a bona fide ep giving ample time to show off some range: for an act about whom so little is known carves out a surprisingly three-dimensional personality here opening with were eased into a deep dark place with slow tempos participatory handclaps and an abundance of swing as we exit that party were led into the woods with a tensely contemplative jam splitting the difference between shackleton and donato dozzy from the onset of though we know weve really arrived: the track is all pulse with knife-slicing percussion cutting syncopated slices through the boom loses the straight kick in favor of rolling bass punches and more than a bit of uk-style steppin with just the slightest sliver of color sneaking in through the cracks in the beat

is a 1982 film by vietnamese filmmaker trinh t minh-ha ostensibly its about life in post-colonial senegal but really its a critique of films that try to explain one culture from the perspective of another minh-has disjointed sequence of sounds and images doesnt help us understand the senegalese way of life so much as bewilder us further at the beginning of the film she narrates: i do not attempt to speak about just speak nearby in their album of the same name take this idea to heart the lead single samples a spoken word track from jupiter the 1998 solo album of dip in the pool singer (which was reissued as an ep last year) the portland duo have translated the speech into midi information and fed it into a battery of synths so that their pentatonic cascades uncannily mirror s voice this is pretty much the albums mo its serene new age moods and bright synthetic palette suggest a strong primary influence: the japanese leftfield synth scene of which was a part celebrated on the influential fairlights mallets and bamboo mixes recorded by spencer doran but the duo dont simply mimic the style nor fetishise it as exotic instead they speak nearby it using chance operations midi translation and other generative principles to refract it into modern shapes voices are often central to the duos method on hints of speech surface from a scree of clicking synth arpeggios later strange trembling sounds flirt with the uncanny theyre either synths processed to sound voice-like or voices with a vocoded robotic sheen on similar vocoder tones make gentle interjections over an exquisite texture of mallet percussion and ersatz birdsong and on the duo alongside fellow portland synth explorer conduct a wobbly robot choir in a sort of smeared update of baroque choral music isnt the albums only guest appearance with is one of its highlights echoing the domino producers recent self-titled lp in its innovative use of software instruments first woodwinds then plucked strings are bent into uncanny digital shapes a celebration of faked human inflection the duo repeat the trick on where some kind of synthetic saxophone is sent into bizarre breathy paroxysms music makes sense alongside a set of -related projects such as lifted and co la that are equally abstract playful and boundary-breaking in their use of digital tools is the finest lp yet to emerge from this diffuse scene and it also brings a new set of ideas to the table in engaging with a specific pre-internet style it brushes against knotty debates about appropriation exoticism and decontextualised borrowing in the online age the musics gorgeous synthetic babble suggests ways of speaking nearby the things we love but will never fully understand
quebec native first appeared on a compilation from turbo records earlier this year but save for the lone single hes about as new to the scene as you can get just because he doesnt have a lot down in print though doesnt mean hes short on talent clearly the shadowy figure has spent countless hours behind his gear as the deft touch of a seasoned professional is obvious on the three original versions presented on this two ep collection the original of looms and bends its way in to the psyche with a slowly warming 303 backing melody helping to compromise for the almost awkward squelching bells that are sprinkled throughout the track its easy to be thrown off by the bizarre pairing of sounds but once the groove finds its way to your feet its surprisingly hard to ignore just how fantastically its executed though its version is saved for a b-side of the second vinyl this wholly trance-tinged take of the original shrugs off the aggression in favor of a more palatable yet kitschy variation of a decidedly old-school laced burner rounding out the inclusions is a late night sleeper jam pitched remarkably slower than the rest of the cuts on the two records loopy hypnotic and sexy this is the perfect way to spice up a slowhouse set original productions aside what really makes the two-part record collection worth buying is the stellar and varied remixes silent since 007 the production duo of jesper dahlb ck and jori hulkkonen k kebacid is an almost perfect fit for remix duties on their version starts off simply enough but right around the halfway mark they turn the already impressive original in to full-on 303 warfare if theres ever a perfect time to use the term jacking its now acid has never sounded as revived as this whereas youd expect as much from kebacid things get interesting on the second ep italian headfuck aficionado giorgio is first up with a monster sized space-techno reworking on the long playing -side his signature hypnotic sound graces this take of bubbling and chugging along through two impressive breakdowns of different intensity minus artist hobo meanwhile churns out a predominantly clubby version: but dont think thats a bad thing his remix is surprisingly dense and craftily arranged a shuffling mental variation of the already powerful original
after the success of s 2003 release on the label has called upon his services yet again to supply a smooth house release in it is packed with the original mix as well as a marty goodwin mix and the release has already been getting some solid support from the likes of meat katie dj vibe and parks wilson in particular the original freedom avenue mix is a solid house cut a pretty chunky 4/4 drum pattern is helped along with a solid baseline loop and smooth delicate sounds a little vocal sample is used to good effect but all in all this is a solid track that remains pretty similar throughout without losing its appeal the marty goodwin mix is on the b-side and it is a dark and dirty breaks interpretation of the original mix the baseline is pure evil for the entire duration and there are some smooth string patterns midway and deep into the production it is clear to see why meat katie has licensed this for his upcoming bedrock breaks mix another solid release from the ever-reliable stable and good variation with a quality house and breaks production the label sets to continue its run of good releases with matthew dekay alvredo supplying the next release with symbiosis
heading home recordings hits double figures with the mr big start ep by markus nikolai nina featuring remixes from the likes of dubloner and land shark the original mix is simply addictive with a fantastic vocal that simply oozes style alongside a deep and chunky yet irresistibly funky baseline the track starts off with a cheeky baseline but soon turns into a smooth house number thanks to the soothing vocals and deep smooth low-end first up on the flip is the tasty land shark dub remix this is some purely addictive tech electro house here thanks to some quirky percussion and a nice retro baseline that compliments the nice retro riffs the vocal is used fantastically well filtered in nicely with the beats and the track has a great upbeat vibe throughout the dubloner big remix is again another fantastic piece of work from this highly talented producer smooth yet irresistibly chunky the remix works its magic with cut up vocals a chunky low end rumble and some smooth jazzy riffs a fantastic release here from heading home with 3 very tasty and diverse productions here that is sure to please
if they werent so nicely weighted the complex evolving rhythmic elements to s house music might make you a bit insane despite his foundations being so tightly woven together however they come together over the course of this ep to make for a pleasingly liquid rather than annoyingly lanky listen hits the ground running as well as the aforementioned and complex bottom ends made from finger clicks claps and all manner of off-kilter percussive elements a soothingly forlorn atmosphere hangs in the air courtesy of a john roberts-styled candlelit piano line and detached female vocal: its deep and housey but not deep house per se and seems to hurry yet dawdle at the same time is the other original offering and one which pairs another dead-of-night tinkle on the keys with yet more multi-layered drums and hits but rises up and down more than which operates on a strictly horizontal plane some diving distant tones hint at a sleep-deprived state of mind but things never wholly unravel instead folding you in and in right to their end
hypercolours sublabel continues to impress in with s ep arguably even stronger than jack dixons effort from earlier in the year quick scouring of the interweb turns up precious little about the producers background but a soundcloud page reveals that he/she is into making lots [sic] of music and not sticking to anything that drags [sic] me into a genre if i like it ill steal it if genre-sidestepping is one of the principal aims a damn good job theyve done too with more than a touch of bump flex about it may be significantly darker in tone than its garage-dwelling cousins from the turn of the century but it certainly follows a similar route from the game boy-ish bleeps to the squeaky lovelorn vocal it superbly conveys a real sense of nostalgia enhanced and made all the more emotional by a huge rumbling bass drop straight out of the 2-step glory days things get progressively housier but no less interesting over the course of the next three tracks is enthusiastically bouncy and fast-paced with a crunchy lead line and loopy vocals still maintaining a vague whiff of the 2-step flaunt but within a definite 4/4 structure get you thinkin is dreamily waifish; a beautiful but indistinct stream of delicate elements held down by a powerful sub wrapping things up is firm drums and a distant male vocal are all you have for company until some dubby echoed stabs momentarily shed light on the increasingly dark path ahead
one of italys finest djs and producers makes his debut on one of italys premier breakbeat labels rocca is already known for his releases with 5th suite on uk breaks label functional breaks and has also collaborated with 2-step pioneer zed bias as da luq on soulja records and has also extensively djed in italys maffia club his debut release for mantra is a 3-tune ep featuring a variety of breakbeat styles at the train first up is at the train which features a housey percussive breakbeat with an electro arpeggio and synth line layered over the top and female vocal stabs added in the main breakbeat has a distinct shuffle about it with highly syncopated snares while on the bottom end of the spectrum a dirty growling electro bassline makes sure things keep rumbling along should work on both electro and breaks floors with lots of crossover potential give up (maffia soundsystem mix) this one is probably produced with the maffia clubs soundsystem in mind and kicks off with a mellow intro featuring long synth sweeps and a tight rolling break to admit i personally didnt find the intro appealling that is until rocca got into the meat of the tune a big 4 to the floor booming bass line butts in with a hip hop vocal sample placed on top and a wicked horn line it seems like rocca was just teasing us with the intro then smacks us over the head with a lethal combination of breaks and bass dubby jay on the opposite side of the breaks spectrum is dubby jay which as suggested by the title is a laidback dubby groove with a mellow synth line a dubby precussive break with lots of deep hollow tones used to top it all off rocca drops in a few vocal stabs and a jazzy keyboard hook and deep bass
like the first cd you bought like the first comic book you read or like the first kiss you ever had it s always a memorable one vincent casanova s new label has commenced with an interesting ep by s in touch arrivals the teaser that opens the ep reminds you of ancient future sound of london with the gentle ambient-side of moby slow temperamental builds; going from high-to-low creating space and ambience to calm the mind; brian eno continues to influence new generations of music producers listening you soon find that the hypnotic soundscapes keeps your ears in place opening them in an enlightening way remember a few years ago and charlie may released technodubfest the free cd given away with the ministry of sound magazine (yes mos was still good for something) and you heard loads of dubby techno joints well the second track off the ep has the same aroma as the compilation clutching lots of metallic melodies bizarre electronic soundscapes and bouncy rhythms bye bye fits that very moody atmosphere abstract in an afterhours kind of way it compliments the first track quite nicely as a home listening enhancer the final piece is the closest to working in a traditional dance mix a touch of retro synths over a breakbeat makes juice a fun track to play it doesn t straw too far from its funky breaks and boppy rhythms but it still sounds a bit dated most of the ep does in fact as you could imagine most of this being created during the early days of ambient techno nonetheless it s still worth a good listen though each of the three tracks are a bit shorter than expected fears not as these three tracks are not the typical dance cuts to destroy the club; in fact i couldn t see anyone play the ep to make people dance instead it sounds as though this was created for the home and the headphones to enjoy with s ep it looks to be defining what will be and is all about
s been a busy man as of late and has been one of his most anticipated tracks sure its only 140 beats per minute but its not dubstep; instead the tlanta producer ties down a rabid rave beat that is so claustrophobic and ferocious that it practically catches fire along the way like so many other producers at the moment finds his own way to fold in a 303 and it bubbles and burps noxiously in the chaos around it the tracks unrelenting pounding recalls very early r s the frenzied throb a spiritual sibling to tamphex digeridoo and mentasm on the flipside slows things down for a track stuffed with the same faded neon nylon strings as his excellent collaboration with hxdb earlier this year its a fascinating way to make your debut on your new home ( album is due to come out soon on the label ) but whos complaining when the material is so damn unique
records tend to subsist on a strict sonic diet his tough basslines the bread and butter of his music seldom come with anything too fancy: a synth line a catchy sample or some shakers will usually do this means the greatest asset of gregory darsas music is its jack-of-all-trades diversity 7 his latest release as is a mood board that draws in different emotions from the pastel euphoria of to the bright carnival funk of dg is the eps sole misfire its a 90s house-style tune that thanks to its hotchpotch of vocal samples carries a paunch it doesnt wear particularly well is the most spartan track and the most sober couldnt accuse of being uninviting but its furnishings may be too garish for some propelled by a brassy trumpet and a zoo of samples it walks gamely if unsteadily on the line separating fun and frivolity hits its stride with much more confidence its affecting balearic tones glide over signal noises and a valedictory shout that sounds like a call to arms
s full-length debut earlier this year proved that the russian house empress has a winning line in atmospherics and emotion one of the records moodier tracks features freaky slow-fast-slow out-of-sync time structures a clunking kick drum rhythm and pitch-bent rhodes it proves a fertile ground for remixers ex-bizarre inc and chicken lips man dean meredith drags back somewhere in the vicinity of chicago circa 1987 its smart music-making meredith spotting the old skool-ish charms of the vocal then letting it run free among squiggly sinuous acid basslines and fizzing hi-hats boss matthew dwards then unleashes a box of snapping tom-toms and slapped congas all over interspersing it with beeps and shutter clicks it sounds like a lorry being reversed into a clutch of photographers its left to new jersey native dj to lead back to gentler moodier territory punctuated by a vocal seemingly plunged in an out of a bathtub its a mix of burning deep dubby house with beats that are almost imperceptibly light in texture

is a new collaborative female only label its three main protagonists make up its first release in which we have three mood driven house cuts exploring similar but separate dead of night deep house vibes s is the highlight: kicks a little quicker than her beatdown norm but just as purposefully dropped kicks underpin veiled female coos swirling pads and a buried deep within the mix guitar line that adds a gnarly edge to an otherwise radiant and airy arrangement forever on the move s is the next best for the way it restlessly wriggles about in the same spot without ever really surging forward that happens as a result of some rippling overlapping melted chord stabs that never leave the mix instead acting as a muddled melodic screen behind which an african sounding male chants indecipherably finally sandwiched in between this and the aforementioned is s paranoid and droning its a mysterious little shapeshifter that draws you right in and never chucks you out thereby allowing you to catch your breath between the two more expressive offerings

though they first arrived in 2008 it was really in 2011 that the london trio dom butler gabe gurnsey and lead nik void finally began to make waves with their muscular modular workouts first with (real love) on optimo music and then with the dead-eyed post punk grind of on dfa just as importantly over the last few years the band has steadily developed one of electronic musics most lionized live acts add to that nik voids collaboration with chris carter and cosey fanny tutti of throbbing gristle and a remarkable ep of balearic minimalism earlier this year with peter gordon and its clear why s debut arrives as one of s most-anticipated full-lengths maintains the formula that opened our ears initially: industrial post-punk that wobbles and pounds its way to the dance floor ncluded are and the lead single from earlier this year both slices of grey-and-black android hedonism but fresh to the album are some of the bands most propellant creations to date on their heady combination of live and electronic percussion underlines a strobe-lit noise anthem thats sure to please fans of their early singles though it relies less on their formative rhythmic backdrops is sly herky-jerky electronica its anxious synths left to buzz and twitch against its machine-drum spazz there are respites and retreats between these more motion-bound creations opener for example is a withdrawn and forlorn moment of distance with its ringing synths tumbling around the edges of voids robot-drawl gives us roughly 40 seconds of strange clarity before the blast of in which voids voice ripples into a well void perhaps the most unexpected of these small detours is essentially just a minute and 40 seconds of the kind of pre-dawn alo crawl you might expect from alians do better but situated just before and the bruising closer its a welcome recline before another descent into the trios mechanized dance floor summons s these short but critical tracks that massage into a well-considered and promising debut album one that knows just when to stop and breathe before breaking another sweat
the third and final part in cyberfunks mini series the good the bad and the ugly sees baobinga bring out the ugly side of breaks - ugly to the point where its just plain dirty and tough baobinga first made his name releasing on plastic raygun pulling out housey breaks tunes with lots of groove and lots of bass after the tear out phenomenon hit break beat baobinga made a transition to dj quests cyberfunk label and created a storm with his release the bashment track/twin glocks jack your body with 30hz jack your body is a title that sounds more suited to a house tune than a dark breaks tune however the guttural jack your body male vocal samples used in this particular track say otherwise baobinga teams up with in-house vertical sound producer and rising breaks star 30hz to deliver a wicked rinse out tune where each producers influence is clearly heard - 30hzs breakbeats loaded with percussion and razor like tech hooks are prominent as are baobingas old skool sirens big tear out bassline and well placed drum fills js war js war uses a garagey style break incorporating lots of drum fills with nice use of echoey effects and loaded with techy stabs and bleeps a deep electro style bassline kicks in during the first breakdown and is accompanied by sci-fi stabs and a war vocal all of which play a part in the remainder of the tune positive vibes with darqwan an apache styled break kicks off this tune with a repeated positive vibes vocal loop layered on top an ascending bassline then kicks in which throughout the tune gets its share of effects and variations play god fans of baobingas bashment track/twin glocks release and also the feeling which he did with i d will love this tune on a dark grimey tip this tune fuses haunting synths and sci-fi stabs with a dirty grime bassline and a slamming beat that takes no prisoners with its wicked drum fills - sometimes breaking down into triplets to top it all off the title takes its name from the vocal sample that gets dropped in during various moments of the tune

belgian imprint has been an excellent source of subtly compelling electronic miniatures over the past couple of years here the label welcomes german-indonesian producer into the fold for the second in its series of free-to-download releases bakso is reportedly a failed bookbinder-turned-media designer who grew up in former east germany (a deliciously intriguing backstory) and this is his first release in some respects it slots neatly into the formula: much like the series inaugural lp wanda groups cleaners it features swatches of unobtrusive cracked ambient techno more concerned with the probing of subtle details rather than the acting out of grand gestures but where wanda groups lp specialised in bright but claustrophobically rendered melodics baksos soundworld is far darker and less demonstrative woven through this record are textures that crackle with the quiet fervour of electrical circuits possessed; background sounds that resemble the chirruping of data-scrambled crickets or the gentle hiss of steam being released from decrepit machinery opener is perhaps the most pastoral thing here which is to say that its metallic synth tones and methodically pulsing toms manage to evoke a kind of alien comfort as well as distant menace closer meanwhile is the most outgoing its tightly constricted drone and bursts of distorted kick drums slipping into a densely abstracted hip-hop groove but most of the ep operates in between those two poles; the threshold between soothing and unsettling is well-trodden ground here in the gorgeous machine-like sounds writhe and squeal softly in the upper register while muzzy pads outline in the barest terms a harmonic progression elsewhere s pulsating bursts of noise are punctuated just once by a limpid spray of raindrop-like synth notes like all of these tracks its extreme brevity leaves you envisioning far larger structures and a far more substantial release in which baksos ideas could fully unfurl heres hoping such a release isnt far off
bangers ash series asks artists to create eps with two distinct parts: heady experiments on one side and straight-up dance tracks on the other this is how were introduced to young brooklyn producer who balances abstract promise with a struggle for functionality on his debut release things start out well with the experimental-leaning side and ease into a magnetic storm of analogue machines synth malfunctions underlaid by a slow heartbeat not unlike something that might come from pan is based on percolating hand percussion and wandering scrap metal finishes up the side with some ostgut-style droning techno replete with what sounds like a cars turning signal where the first three tracks come off unpredictable and edgy is clearly following a formula an issue exacerbated on the clubbier flipside and the both suspend bilious leads in a cloud of reverb but it sounds like hes using the all-too-common device to obscure rather than to expand result is run-of-the-mill techno murk with none of the a-sides derelict flair
the duo consisting of greeces lex tsiridis and berlin-based huseyin evirgen are at their best when they get weird t least the relatively conventional melodies of their recent m_rec ltd release didnt intrigue me as much as the tunneling techno they had produced for prologue over the past year or so fortunately their ep for a new label based in thens shows that their experimental tendencies are finely tuned for now both 1 and 2 lurch forth unevenly to the insistent ghoulish jangle of ticks and hi-hats and the former with its smoothly sulking groove goes on for almost nine minutes but the records finest moment is 2 which rides a sharply syncopated rhythm into what sounds like long panes of glass shattering in slow motion whatever it is its sure to leave a few heads in ragged shape and while kangding s remix appearance might be a draw for many at first i wouldnt be surprised if it ends up being overlooked the raston-noton artists trimming of 2 into a lean agile stepper is a solid effort to be sure but its not as remarkable as the confidently muscular original tracks from
i remember the first time i saw king midas sound: may of 2010 during the futureeverything festival in manchester their debut hyperdub album waiting for you had been stewing in its gloomy heartbroken juices for a few months already syrian wedding singer omar souleyman demdike stare and the legendary mark ernestus performing with paul st hilaire were also billed it was quite the spread but king midas sound left the most resonant impression it was loud really loud loud in an all-consuming render-you-motionless kind of way the volume swallowed up all the poignant songwriting all the wounded sentiment to make the music impactful in a very physical kind of way at this years incubate festival king midas sounds performance of their collaboration with the austrian guitarist and experimental artist christian fennesz was none of those things from an ocean of loud and brutal acts on tap kms were one of the gentler more soothing and theatrical reprieves for those clutching their free earplugs and feeling cheated it mightve been a letdown for those of us appreciating the serene tonal washes that fennesz brought to the performance however it was a slow-building smoky crescendo of noise perhaps all the more potent for lending airiness to an otherwise heavyweight show as andrew ryce noted about aroo king midas sounds first release for back in 2013 it seemed like all the lovely heady dub foundations of their hyperdub records had been replaced by something closer to ambient and shoegaze in many ways continues down that route is the only real dub track here with the rest sounding like a post-rock apparition that leaves its mark with cold fingers and tender caresses the press release seems eager to paint in the same abject tones as its predecessors its certainly still bleak as ever but theres more hope than before reflected in billowy vistas on tracks like and the aqueous instrumental you could say the albums heart-tugger is an eerie grainy ballad sung by kiki hitomi and for that it might be the most memorable the other standout moments are led by roger robinson and his signature hushed high-pitch tone as on he always turns a song into a hypnotic lullaby that sticks with you long after its over is another creepy skulking example of king midas sounds spectral idiosyncrasies which make a haunted delight
if s 2010 album black sands were an actor it would have been ralph fiennes it was suave refined and pretty posh compared to his cheekier sample-based albums si greens third full-length also had a similar brooding intensity where deep emotion came through in subtle string arrangements that were the musical equivalent of a trembling lip in many ways it projected an old-fashioned english sophistication that like fiennes was a hit across the atlantic where he relocated to record this follow-up also sounds quite english in a more modern sense some of the artists green enlisted for 2012s black sands remixed showed his affiliation with londons bass scene and sure enough fractured two-step rhythms and downbeat melodies are a hallmark here with its shades of mj cole has probably the toughest beat here and while dont s is nominally housey its pace and twinkling melodies make it seem more like a torchlit procession green may have moved many miles himself but he hasnt strayed too far from black sands musical territory res a similar mood of dreamy melancholy enhanced by production thats opulent without being ostentatious s layers of rippling chimes and percussion feel like sheets of silk while plucked harps amidst the cut-up vocals and sub-bass tremors of conjure up a burial soundtrack to narnia rather than south london much attention will focus on s appearance on yet despite her star status this magisterial piece of neo-soul doesnt overshadow the album as a whole featuring s molasses vocals recalls massive attacks terry callier collaboration live with me and suggests green makes massive attack records better than they do themselves these days indeed sumptuous and accomplished as it is echoes other great electronic soul records like protection the aforementioned sincere or sbtrkts debut it might be dismissed as dinner party music by those with a hunger for more experimental fare but is charming fascinating and a touch mysterious exactly the qualities youd want in your dinner party guest

gets into double figures with this release from in the track also features a remix from label manager stama alongside etostone the original mix is a pretty nice upbeat piece of breakbeat that has already seen support from the likes of kingkade and tony thomas the beats are bouncy and the track features some pretty smooth vocal lines as well as some nice electro tinged melodies solid work here from roman the etostone vs stama remix on the flip is more minimal and features acid lines and a more electro feel to it despite this i feel this remix has lost some of the magic that the upbeat original mix has and although it is smooth and quite solid it for me isn t as strong as the original

re was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile he found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile so goes an old english nursery rhyme dating from the 19th century its a fitting name for sheffields richard barratt whos zig-zagged from late 80s acid house as funky worm to early idm as half of sweet exorcist and the acid jazz of all seeing i not all of his projects have aged well but the earliest singles seemed promising barratt cherry-picked from his first three self-released singles and the four singles that dfa released this year for his self-titled album opener trims the 14-minute single version to a succinct seven ethereal intro turns to a deftly quickening pace building with female coos and glints of pedal steel guitar until it reaches a sleek dub climax is the kind of chicago house homage that dfa excels at ( la juan maclean or the first hercules love affair album) complete with a throbbing bass thump a soulful vocal and an anthemic piano line o bad it clocks out after four minutes but then goes off the rails limp expressionless sounds like early 00s electroclash has a sweet croon and spare electro backdrop but the track never escapes its own inertia ill might be an homage to the stripped-down sound of classics like master c js dub love but it comes off like an unfinished demo originally released in 2012 remains the most realized track though its little kalimba lick has since been copped by so many other producers that it feels dated could be another chicago house ode yet its elements never quite congeal a falsetto sings the chorus but the verses no matter how soulfully sung sound inane repetition of the line i just cant figure out feels like a confession from the artist himself closer again draws on the ascendant piano chords that defined so many house tracks but theres no wrinkle or update on that well-worn trope despite the name s greatest fault is ultimately how straight barratt plays it

well then grand overlord of raw stripped back techno given the shonky treatment on freak n chic of all labels hmm to many a devotee its nothing less than sacrilege only compounded by that fact that the frenchman responsible has done little more than lower the tempo throw in some relatively pointless samples and slap on a jacking tech house beat (i e not very much) fortunately though it works if only by default original released back in 2002 as part of s immense point lank lp is an absolute stunner and reason enough to pick up this record breathless piece of sleek hydraulic techno it conjures up utopian images of a mechanised post-industrial future rid of todays grubby historical small print coming out at a relatively dry time for the genre it reeked of class and still does ut what of shonkys version quite frankly its a harmless ibiza-friendly update; nothing more nothing less aforementioned samples a glossy vocal and a swooping aircraft both mildly inane keep enough with the original to steer clear of trouble whilst the housified percussion fit with obligatory congos lends the track a pleasantly bouncy feel drama is provided by a couple of tidy well-placed drops and the whole thing sticks together in a satisfyingly restrained fashion ll in all its a solid rework that (quite rightly) makes no attempt to supersede its master for that shonky deserves credit s they say: if it aint broke dont fix it
skee masks music has always had an element of retro but never more so than on the first release in the new ilian skee series despite its title basks in the glow of early techno and 90s idm it homes in on the atmospheric passages of skee masks stellar debut album shred putting on is like slipping into a velvet bathrobe but the shuddering delay effects and exquisitely swung drums keep it from getting too soft at the edges the broken beats are as impeccable as ever most of the ep has an improvised feel is pacy techno with a heavy kick drum but the sudden pattern shifts keep it from bludgeoning you (the soft pads dont hurt either ) things get weirder on the b-side theres the dizzy tribalism of which sounds like peverelist sent back in a time machine to the 90s and the gorgeous ambient of where pitter-patter drums move like ripples in water all of s tracks burst with skee masks colour skill and sense of space those qualities help make him one of technos most exciting producers even when hes looking back
from the cheeky artwork to the no-holds-barred music do things with a schoolboys zeal the french label prints zine-like sleeves adorned with cartoon characters inside jokes and cryptic slogans bros hoes before bros read the pilotwings molitor 71 ; a recent basses terres ep reassured us it was fishscale certified mon cousin of all bdfm records -zbels are the brashest with a title like hyena sticks head in elephants butt the trios latest ep promises music thats silly and heedless which it occasionally is but the influence of rave and techno keeps it focused the ep borrows liberally from 90s british dance music which - handle with confidence even when its familiarity could be distracting their approach works best when they throw caution to the wind as on misogyn with a hail of breakbeats at its core the track swerves from jungle tribute to gabber worship as the drum pattern accelerates impulsively - are more caged in on the acid-soaked but feral instincts keep them rattling the bars as ride cymbals whip and rimshots spray its easy to get caught up in the feverish energy
with sharing the same label as the crew from ed banger one would have thought that a digital ep of remixes for the french singers third album would have come courtesy of sebastian or possibly dj mehdi but instead of keeping it in the family have asked producers from beyond their own stable perhaps they thought that none of their own electro noisemakers could do the tracks any ahem justice lead single sees gainsbourg collaborate with her album producer and pop eccentric beck the pair yield a folk duet that is positively upbeat despite its disjunct tenebrous lyrics taking the song in his own moody direction so cals newest beatsmith nosaj aka jason chung exhibits precisely why he has been pricking so many ears of late transforming it into a gloomy dubstep remix giving her some proper context to wallow in chung discards all but gainsbourgs vocals and immerses them in a stuttering aquatic loop that bubbles its melody over a lurking sub-bass and click-clack broken beat on a completely different tip norwegian producer diskjokke tackles a track that originally depicted gainsbourgs experience with an mri machine working with the whirring template of the original diskjokke goes for a cosmic space jam that gallops its way through a pumping dance floor not letting up once during its epic eight-plus minutes despite having better remixes of other pop artists to his name in the right hands diskjokkes take has the potential to ride the euphoric peak of any 3 am disco-charged dance floor
much is often made of s female presence in the male-dominated bass music world but what she really brings to the party is not so much some spurious feminine touch but an effervescence and sly humour lacking in some of her more under heavy manners peers thats immediately evident on the title track here whose glassy zig-zag bass judders to a halt with a self-deprecating vocal ahem ts there too on the closing the majestic pr812 which references one reginald chuas frankly comical attempt back in 2000 to hijack a philippine airline flight trying to escape the plane with the passengers valuables using a makeshift parachute with a length of curtain for a ripcord mr chua panicked at the door until pushed out by a flight attendant falling to his death gravely salutes his untimely demise with an arrangement of shifting percussion and pearl string electronics all great fun then those familiar with the incisive vivacity of s live sets will be nodding twitching and smiling in recognition here whether its the latino bells and faintly kraftwerkian vocal tinges of the bass bubbling like black tar the shimmering stalactite synths that spiral through cold soaking and dominate the ep as a whole the sprightly cosmic march of with your mouth or the steely stabbing acidic never falls into easy anthemic patterns or predictable drops the sound scenery is constantly shifting the rhythm never settling the melodies mazy and averse to repetition
too often return to form means that a flailing act has finally made another good album but i like what did with oblivion with bells that uncharacteristically sombre inward-looking album was markedly different in tone from both the bands classic mkii work and hundred days off their superb opening bow as a duo after darren emerson left; it was an experiment that worked then is a return to form not because its the best album arl hyde and rick smith have put out in a while (and it is) but because this record sees the duo returning to the more beat-intensive complicatedly beatific realm of everything from pearls girl to two months off some ways also marks a departure for the band and not just because the album could fit on a single lp or because eight of these nine tracks see hyde and smith employing other acts for additional production like hot chips underrated one life stand marries a renewed emphasis on the dance floor with unabashedly open-hearted lyrics; with their combination of ebullient refrains and bright bursting music a and could all vie for the most straightforwardly joyous song weve heard in a long time s always make perfect music for travelling if youre somewhere you cant dance you should at least be in a car or train or bus anything moving forward and fast but doesnt work at just one speed; the slightly more subdued and in (which sounds like a version of enos bone bomb thats simultaneously calmer and more kicking) provide some needed breathers and the slowly building impressionistic ( a moped started up / sounding like a chainsaw / of tiny firecrackers is my favourite bit of scene-setting in ages) and movingly wracked trembling ballad ease the listener into and out of the album gently the only real misstep is the essentially instrumental which isnt bad just unnecessary on one of s marathon albums it might have been a welcome detour but with the rest of packed so explosively tight its just in the way while its impossible to tell how much polish the various outside producers contribute or whether they got much direction from hyde and smith (how interesting would the demos from this album be for once ) the songs here are a harmonious marriage of the classic propulsive sound and the kind of techniques and textures that postdate most of their career its interesting that an album with so much outside input highlights the bands populist maximalist side if these other artists were trying to bring out what they loved about in their contributions its telling that its hyde and smiths knack for euphoria thats on full display here
the 1999 album sasu ripatti made as is more valuable for the seeds it planted than as a piece of work that fairly dry stuff bore fruit in ripattis own work (as and vladislav delay but especially as luomo) and its also been claimed decently enough on this four-track ep all of which also appears on the remix album of the same name alvo notas rework of keeps the twisting bare synth bass but gives it a flickering dancing quality the central rhythm/riff come at you in pieces strobe-lit machine funk with real slither to it faltydls refunk (ugh) of serves almost as a flashback to the era that put ripatti in the spotlight the early-00s heyday of force inc when glitch got glossy its another smart notch in the wide-ranging new yorkers belt john streamlines into a staticky techy bump thats not especially eventful better is [a]pendics shuffles transformation of s twerpy undulations into intriguing new areas beginning with a taut (particularly the just-reverberant-enough low end) house track and soon moving into more crackling glitch-laden areas

zaltans label has been a consistent source of strange gems since it launched five years ago starting as an outlet for forgotten techno tapes from the 90s it soon began to cover broader sounds s most recent offering is modern electroclash from the little-known band the bands name translates to we suck in italian which hints at the their cheekiness before youve even listened to this self-titled ep s title track dives in with saturated drum machines which pave the way for a sting of sexy italian verbs spoken by a mysterious female voice discordant e m-influenced melodies and the occasional screech l uses a similar template this time delivering a deadpan grocery list heavy breathing and slightly maniacal laughing is rumoured to be a french duo comprising paula from psychedelic garage band j c sat n and panoptique a member of shoegaze band lonely walk who released a techno ep on in 2014 that said still sounds like italian punks trying their hand at electroclash after sneering through a miss kittin the hacker show in 2001 despite electroclashs questionable reputation these days s new iteration does not suck

rhythm sound have always had a near-spiritual comprehension of groove all their work burrows deeply into its soundbed and extracts from it rich subtle forms where romantic composers invented the tone poem what mark and moritz have contributed with rhythm sound is the most highly developed example of a poetics of texture depth and space in electronic music if their self-titled album was the first full exploration of this instrumental landscape their work in dialogue with the artists was a move out of the root of the sound back to the roots of the sound or a way of opening jamaican music out of its fire and colour and sending it (up in smoke) into a rare atmosphere it s difficult to convey how magnificent r s best work is and to most people paying close attention to what they ve been listening to it s probably unnecessary suffice to say the honour of being asked to remix their work would probably have been followed in a heartbeat by a deep feeling of dread in having to offer an interpretation which moves but doesn t remove how can you re-finish a complete statement in its complete collected form reveals a lot both about each artist s vision and interpretive powers and about the art and science of techno dub and remixing basic channel s see mi version is difficult to beat a self-interpretation that shares with its ancestors an incredible ability to resist the effects of time on music while seeming to barely lift a finger vainqueur s remix of rise and praise is also as large as the task this is a real piece of work while sleeparchive s version of dem never know twists the original around s hk -like shapes and back into his own machine s symmetry somehow managing to do justice to the original and himself in the process soundstream s free for all draws the free-floating spirit into an uplifting atmosphere in a way that will please but not overwhelm hallucinator acquit themselves respectably with a big-hearted chug-a-long that like sweet substance s contribution doesn t over-reach itself or offend carl craig s poor people must work is suffering the caning its high-impact hard-hitting push made inevitable it s the odd man out having a big night out but its bombast makes it trying to tired ears tikiman s boss man sounds almost quaint after the craig thunderclap but even though it s less offensively large or loud it s too unambitious and conventional to stand shoulder to shoulder here or is it less successfully villalobos let me go like most of his work sounds like the effects of entropy on aimlessness soaking in its meandering stream it loses and finds itself and the listener somewhere between brilliance and abject boredom francois k s lightning storm could be read as a half-hearted junglist s protest of confusion indifference or misunderstanding unless you ve got a fondness for frantic drums you get the impression that k is trying to fill the gaps like a speaker running off at the mouth for dread of a pause in conversation but vladislav delay s truly is the real disappointment considering what you would presume to be an equal (though very different) appreciation of depth and space perhaps its re-inscription as a luomo mix might render it more accurate and less of a letdown but if it is luomo it s not as good as his own weaker productions in this case particularly you sense that vlad lost his nerve and opted to engage the less risky of his musical selves a collection like this needs to spend years in the world before its strengths and failings finally resolve we need time for the smoke to dissipate for the dust to settle before anyone can say whether anyone here has lived up to the enduring legacy of some of music s most talented and original collaborators i think some of it might
as the first track on there is love in you earlier this year contained all the saccharine innocence that both those names imply based around a cerulean female vocal that looped and stuttered it held the listener in blissful limbo for four minutes hebdens mate caribou and brian eno affiliate jon obviously agree with his original stance as they deliver their own takes on the aesthetic that is were held quite comfortably in different kinds of dreamworlds but never really taken anywhere particularly caribous version: he turns it into the same kind of dense psychedelic mish-mash that characterised swim and makes it more desolate and foreboding tones of hope come through with flashes of the vocal and rising strings pulsing minor chords throb throughout and warm bass enriches the clattering melange theres beauty in the rich detritus hidden within its dense folds which never manages to completely break out this is cinematic deep stuff just a bit incidental meanwhile delivers an even more baby blue version underlaid by a simplistic piano that reflects his work with coldplay until it drops into almost empty breathy fragility and is reborn with washes of strings and choral aah s and the originals angel voice which penetrates briefly and subtly all of which leaves you wide-eyed again it doesnt arrive at the euphoric plain it promises but theres more focus to the idea this time and as a result it comes out shining

ill be honest it gets to this time of year and my ears feel a little fatigued not in the sense that i cant hear but more in the sense that ive already heard it ok so the new year is more of a physiological clean slate than anything else but for some reason amidst all of the retrospective pontification and reflective banter things tend to become cloudy upon hearing though the second l offering from david moufang and jonah sharp under their guise it was as though a cobwebbed cupboard had been cleared by a jet engine the album scurried into record stores at the beginning of november with little fanfare following cold on the heels of the pairs eponymous 1994 collaboration which saw them exploring the dual textures of ambient and house the story goes that moufang and sharp met at an autechre show recorded that initial l lost contact and then bumped into each other once again at another autechre gig last year its an uncanny tale but the only truly relevant point to bear in mind is that the second of those meetings took place in japan two of the tracks ( and ) were recorded there using the studio of an unnamed analogue synth collector but perhaps most pertinently the inspiration drawn from that session among the machines appears to have imbued the project with a sort of audible synth sex concept or in other less crude terms moufang and sharp have drawn into focus the capabilities of their tools and allowed them to run wild the comparisons with moufangs extraordinary adventure on last years songs from the beehive alongside benjamin brunn will serve as an obvious reference point here but as the title suggests is a somewhat less pensive campaign case in point: album opener saunters along like it was balmy and august a tenacious bass and guitar interplay underpins the thing but as explained above the synthesizers are given completely free reign to chatter and play drawing your attention willingly towards higher frequency treats the remainder of the tracks that could loosely be termed as house succeed by nailing two key criteria: inducing a physical reaction while nourishing your aural palette and work these points particularly hard the former through its clipped snare and delicately effected rhodes; the latter via guest s call-to-arms vocals over expansive legato leads meanwhile the 23-minute hier conjures all that shines on the listening front with skinny lazer-like synths being guided through a cave of reverb by an unwavering heartbeat bassline the issue that i often have with electronic music is that many of its practitioners treat synthesis as simply a means to an end whats perhaps most arresting about is that these artists clearly have a deep understanding of their instruments and push that knowledge to its outermost bounds moufang appears to still be discovering fresh nooks and crannies of the nord modular despite using it extensively on the aforementioned songs from the beehive ; takes it to the stage as a centrepiece of the live show; and has no doubt basted this album in it should certainly be considered as a late contender for album of the year but making such a statement would just be adding unnecessary noise to what is otherwise perfect clarity
for the 5th release on is charged with the duty to entertain with his release has only just reached the age of 20 and this release follows 2 solid tracks from pat foosheen on the a-side is the original mix and this track is definitely one for those that like it a little dark smooth drum patterns meet effected acoustic sounds while a deep chugging baseline rings underneath the high-end sounds the vocal line used is quite limited in that it makes little appearances here and there the highlight for in this release comes in the dub the vocal is cut up and looped and the baseline gets little funkier in this mix compared to the deep and dark mood the original mix had smooth mellow sounds also appear throughout giving this mix a much smoother appeal then the original mix not a bad release by and with a release from smight due next on the label it will be interesting to see what the future holds for this nyc based label
we only believe in a god that knows how to dance proclaims in his soundcloud bio as with boss a sha devi the lisbon-based artist explores neo-spiritualism on the dance floor though his music is also about digitised culture and the hyper-connected world it has spawned it results in another fractured hybrid sound from a future filled with uncertain dread the scene of debut ep genezon avi is set sometime after a disaster once earth has begun to rebuild theres fresh hope in the form of a new religion body music which is here to sooth some of humanitys wounds maps the worlds rebirth from nothing tiny souls chant and cry out to one another as they ride a steady swell of restorative noise evolves from the primordial goo into a dub track that takes on churchy connotations in the second half ending up feeling excessive subtler thematic allusions fare better as on a droning number with tribal undertones vaghe s remix of that track taps into a more pressing sense of fatalism a manipulated voice is paramount here and with alluring skill is used in the same way devi does like another piece of percussion
the get physical imprint from germany are ready to unleash another fine talent in the new york born europe based producer has made a pretty strong impact of late with his single i don t know in particular impressing many dj s he also played a role in royksopp s latest album co writing one of the strongest production on that album 49 this time he goes solo with his debut album there are many fine tracks on this album starting with the deep and moody blackface which flows with some crisp beats quirky effects and vocals middle finger music is again another smooth quirky house production with some subtle vocals that ride over some tripped out sounds while the hair is an eerie downtempo production that is somewhat mysterious with its muffled percussion and swirling effects i dont know is a delightful smooth techy vocal number that is quite seductive thanks to the smooth vocals and bouncy basslines and is an undeniable highlight of the album l a mattress is perhaps the grittiest moment of the album thanks to its screeching basslines and aggressive vocals while one one is another seductive smooth moment a sound that chelonis is clearly comfortable with and is probably at his best with le bateau ivre concludes the album in pretty good style with a pretty upbeat track that uses its strong vocals and low end basslines to great effect i must say that this is quite an interesting album with a few pretty soldi tracks throughout i must say that there are a few productions that just don t have the strength to make this a fantastic album and as such i couldn t help but feel that this album could ve been a touch more memorable
fter announcing that their wireblock dress2sweat and stuffrecords imprints were to merge late last year glasgows collective are now ready to set sail with their inaugural release can you blame them for bursting out of the blocks with what has been one of the most hyped tracks that has graced the dance floors of dubstep and funky nights over the past year martyn kode9 ben fo ikonika and modeselektor (who used as the opening cut on their r podcast) are just a handful of the djs whove made sure that its already ingrained into my conscience and not without good reason whether its the slinky 2-step bass the looped female vocal or the whiney pitch-bent synth that gets transformed throughout londons has made sure to include plenty of hooks and while they may be fairly simple its the way that he makes them work together that really makes the track special while this may be a house track its unlikely to cross over into the boxes of more conventional house and techno jocks due to its percussive groundings in k garage and funky saying that if you like your swung beats and are looking for an anthem that is almost guaranteed to get the female contingent of the crowd going might just be right for you whether sasha will do a hyph mngo and play it at his next mega-rave remains to be seen but one-sided vinyl release should make sure that the track gets plenty more play outside of the inner circle of djs that helped to popularise it with future releases from lazer sword kavsrave and redinho already lined-up it looks like well have plenty more to look forward to from during the remaining months of
londons is one of the more interesting producers operating in the teched-up bass-heavy kinda-house kinda-garage sector of the uk right now while his first single on hotflush placed him in a garage pigeonhole somewhere close to joy orbison since then hes established a techno sound that doesnt really sound like anyone else anymore one that is more suave than savage fitzgeralds debut ep for will sauls aus label might be a little too suave following the labels recent meander into uber-polished house and techno is so perfectly opalescent that it provides almost nothing to grasp onto as it slides by on stabby dub techno chords the surface-level sensory overload of pretty sounds and innumerable vocal samples feels well merely surface-level john continues to prove himself an unpredictable remix wizard (following his handclap-happy rework of darkstars gold ) taking the slippery smooth ride of on a severe left turn into staggered breakbeat house each drum hit like a carelessly thrown rock scuffing up fitzgeralds minted groove on the other side sees fitzgerald finding a better fit for his new-agey techno sound pooling vocal samples into an oily slick (as on his fantastic we ilateral ) over a straightforward and chunky kick drum claiming some of the focused energy that lacks
s debut ep is a fresh proposition s a member of mista men the doncaster producer has hewn close to the sound of his region producing energetic takes on bassline for the likes of unknown to the unknown and cheap thrills that genres influence is apparent in his solo records choice of sounds but its hyperactive pace is considerably sedated it makes sense to compare s approach with that of kowton who found his sound by dropping dubstep to house speed while retaining the textures deliberate jungle of zombys labyrinth also comes to mind particularly on which reduces a slender vocal-led roller down to 120 bpm other two tracks are even slower the similarly entwines an r b sample with a shuffling swaggering flow nd the rude grime-inspired perhaps excessively samples crazy titch merkin da cab driver in which the temperamental now-incarcerated grime mc narrowly avoids being parred by a cab driver its difficult to tell what is doing other than taming a frenetic genre similar results could no doubt be achieved by playing bassline tracks at the wrong speed but as it stands draws unlikely lines between the uk undergrounds colorful exuberance and slinky experimental house

you may not have heard of but you probably have heard some of his productions already the project of mexican producer c sar urbina was first showcased on agorias groundbreaking and genre-defying at controls mix way back in 2007: on re urbanas own repe stood comfortably next to burials remix of jamie woon and stefan goldmanns spooky lun ic fringe inspired by scott walkers song of same name is sound of urbina setting personal emotional turmoil (its recording followed a few heartbreaks apparently) to elegiac even funereal times electronic music the term shoegaze seems applied to anything remotely downcast se days but in this specific case it aptly describes mood youll find of which recalls appar his most dismal yet hopeful or on drowned-in-light-distortion album opening of albums eight minute closing track fur r develops ambient mood with added delic e acoustic guitar strumming taking center stage in its se d half while offering twirling displays of intertwining syn tic hisses alfredo nogueira known for his work with likes of telefon tel aviv and appar shows up on whose insistent drumming softly clashes with tracks flo ing background arrangements and while you can clearly hear ne post-punk influences on s almost wire-like bassline itd be a stretch to call this indie-dance even though you get feeling urbinas type of discoth que includes more than a few mute and 4ad releases from 1980s the album also exhibits a penchant for proper dance floor-oriented m erial for example is a holden-esque piece of hypnotic tech house with pompous yet enerv ed drops of dark pads is even more entrancing led by a washing droning intro only a more predictable schaffel-lite house cut la wolfgang voigt devi es from albums mood: it isnt necessarily se d-r e or badly done but it sits more awkwardly next to encircling numbers this is an in sequential mishap however: more than five years in making is sound of a producer skillfully channeling his dearest mentors and form ting influences into a highly personal whole
the smooth one is back after quite an absence from the breaks scene - and this time he has a good reason - hes currently working on his long awaited debut album the first single keep it movin from his forthcoming album sees him team up with breaks mc chickaboo who is known for her work with timo maas (shifter) and rennie pilgrem blim (2freaks) side a jjs ritzy disco version the ritzy disco version showcases jjs house side going on a dancefloor oriented 4 to the floor tip and it sounds like jjs has been influenced by the likes of etienne de crecy deep melodic basslines percussive beats and funky synth hooks with a distinct reggae/dub flavour to them only to be helped out by mc chickaboo with her deep ragga styled vocal output on the flip side is a dub version sans-chickaboo for those who love the vibe but dont need the lyrics (well most of them) side a album version the dancehall flavoured album version is more designed for home listening than the floor (but who am i to say eh ) filled to the brim with reggae flavours - echoey drums dub style bass line which jjs then breaks up even more during the bridge im definitely digging this one and the ritzy mix i can only hope that the rest of the album is just as good side b vandal remix vandals shrugged off the reggae flavour from the previous two tracks in favour of heavy basslines and big dancefloor oriented breaks similar in style to soul of man and stanton warriors (espeically when theyre on the remix tip - which has been a lot lately ) it gets a little bit repetitive at times but this remix works best as a dj tool thanks in part to the extended vocal breakdown in the middle fans so far are the likes of meat katie krafty kuts and ali b
with paul woolford brings an edge to big-room dance music the b-word is often a dirty one but lets not kid ourselves: woolford makes arena-worthy tracks hes just clever about it recent hits like untitled have crossed over in a big way bringing the kind of exposure that woolford experienced after erotic discourse in the mid-2000s the difference now is that its on his own terms the project which has delivered a handful of 12-inches and a stellar album that looked back to the halcyon days of pirate radio exemplifies woolfords no-holds-barred approach allows him to focus his energies differently than he would under his own name by indulging his love of late 80s and early 90s rave and it still slams as hard as anything else with the triple-ep package returns with a bigger label (a joint release between and houndstooth his regular outpost) and a broader outlook youll notice as much two tracks in when woolfords typical onslaught of breaks and basslines melts away to reveal a springy piano riff not unlike the one that sent untitled into the stratosphere woolford isnt using as a vehicle for personal nostalgia anymore hes using it to make the hardest bangers he can muster appropriates specific devices from rave hardcore and jungle rather than remaining true to their original blueprints most of the tracks motor along at house tempos offering subtle variations on old-school dance music this results in jock jams-style riffs bolstering the likes of and whose most boisterous moments sound strangely like c c music factory we also get rippling hardcore chords on which shows why succeeds instead of sticking to pastiche its sleek and hard-hitting starting with a firm techno beat before loosening up a bit feels like a classic but its built for modern club play woolford uses the third ep to feel out the limits of the project from the sci-fi touches of to torch song a clear standout this one is built on a ruddy chassis of clacking drums while the growling reese basslines gently fizzle out instead of revving up woolford throws in a tender vocal and some swooping hollywood strings gussying up his grotty warehouse in lace and velvet reminds me of when woolford sampled lana del rey on one of his earliest tracks a choice that felt anachronistic set against vintage breaks on however the smoky mood sounds natural in part because woolford fully gives in to the melodramatic shebang shows how far the project has come proving versatility and fresh ideas are essential even when your sights are facing backwards the hints in the name: might use the tools of the past but thats just part of what makes it so definitively
the sac creep up on their 20th release with a complete stormer from vitaliy levin and danny nilsson aka - a smooth prog number entitled the original mix is first of the plate having a tight groove made up of a luscious meld of rich stabs and busy percussion along with tight tribalish rhythms cutting the pace while gradually building the momentum in an organic warm progression track two is a damien heck remix churning out a pure dancefloor mover using parts of the original to create a powerful high energy concoction with added stuttering strings re-enforcing the flow and packing a punch behind it from start to finish sacs best release to date whether its the original or hecks mighty remix this will do some needle damage
chances are youve heard of though his alias of datashat and the businessfunk series a compilation of 80s corporate motivational songs turned into mixtapes that were inspired and daft in equal measure john davis interest in goofing around hasnt quite died out on this long player but the hours and hours hes spent in his bedroom studio over the last two years have clearly tempered his taste for the peculiar with a degree of seriousness and the kind of anorak passion that can produce the very best electronic music which is what this record is is all the more impressive for the fact its johns first album hes worked up to it with home-pressed cdr eps and a split ep with plant 43 back in 2006 also on ai but for a first proper outing its no exaggeration to say the 27-year-old web designer has done extraordinarily well a fair chunk of is a lopsided take on electronica with a robotic fun(k) element to it built around jerky breaky/brokeny/electro beats with odd noises thrown in its the kind of music you could easily imagine machines on a car production line dancing to especially given the effects include what sounds like a big metal ball sliding down a big metal slide and hitting a big metal wall (worms) or an urghh that resembles a piston beatboxing ( ) but then just when you think you know he shows you this whole other side or rather i should say sides the most impressive thing about the album is that john takes on so many different styles and nails them all theres an andy stott on a track which seems to sustain itself with the just the slightest of neon flicks and a new wave on where he picks up the tempo and adds in a spine-tingling guitar melody and have a stunning trashscape appeal the latter of which reeks of orchestra of bubbles in the way the synths and horns seem to ripple up and out of the track and give you an oh-so-ellen moment only now its oh-so-john (yes i know that doesnt sound half as good) the albums two slower tracks and are equally mesmerising evolves like a spiders web of harp strings whilst the last track on the album could be the closing credits from blade runner johns only tribute to businessfunk comes in the form of which rocks in a frenzied computer says error kind of way but dont worry thats about as close as we get to oversized shoulder pads bar charts and permed hair the rest of explodes beyond such semi-ironic tomfoolery and instantly establishes mr davis as a serious talent to watch
many of the acts that featured together with on the genre-defining beat dimensions vol 1 have gone on to receive international and cross-genre success in the four years since its release the vigo-based producer has similarly offered up a healthy dose of head-nod charm with cinematic boom-bap on his previous releases on offshoot nod navigators and all city but has yet to receive the acclaim or attention many of his peers have soaked up in the past 12 months look for that to change with flying lotus in anticipation of his cosmogramma album has talked about his drive to expose a deeper range of influences partially in reaction to the number of impersonators skimming the surface of his original works this widening of influence and output range seems symptomatic of an original wave of beatsmiths striving to coin their own unique sound as opposed to eating themselves into a repetitive copycat oblivion tropical charming and nostalgic as much as it looks to the future; is a fine example of this maturation going on among similar producers the title track is an anthemic analog hip-hop creation which leans heavily on gallego bagpipes for an organic blast off into a hey-ing and ho-ing ride of emotional electro-funk and drone bass intended as homage to a local vigo discoteque and record labels such as tabu and prelude takes you to the beach with robots serving coconut cocktails as the sun goes down a robot love story of cinematic proportion follows on in cx before the 2-step of brings you back to a world more familiar to fans of hudson mohawke closes things elegantly with a pina colada of electric r b that flirts with the purple sound currently synonymous with bristol judging by these productions certainly deserves a greater share of the light some of his luminaries have recently been bestowed

the latest release from the stables comes from aussie ex-pat smithmonger who has released tunes on tcr and even had his vodka tune picked up by none other than james lavelle for his global underground release alongside him is studio partner grunhard - a relatively new name in the breaks scene and together theyve managed to pull off one slammin tune the bassline feels like it has been pulled off the recent smash by raw as fuck - the slammer it has a similar melody however smithmonger and grunhard have spliced it up a little bit for a rolling bass effect accompanying smithmonger and grunhard is jez on rap vocals a sweet female vocal sample some melodic techy hooks and a couple of eager siren sounds (go those sirens ) on the flip side smithmongers edit removes the jez rap vocal for some straight up breakbeat madness - good for those who like to incorporate mcs into their set

(larry holcombe and mark kane) are one of the newest duos to cause a stir on the burgeoning breaks scene blowing up with the body rockin b-boy breakin double platter acid rock/stripped down funk on 777 and waking the dread on spinout records for botchit breaks they deliver one wobble board bassline rocker and a ragga flavoured tune on the jump up tip 50k kicks off with a steady grooving breakbeat and before you know it a vocal sample claims that the tune is powered by 50 000 watts of funkin it certainly does bring out the funk thanks to a blaxploitation funk guitar lick a highly energetic breakbeat which is now loaded up with percussive effects with a big rolling wobble bass line beefing up the testosterone levels and certainly holding it all together proven to get a crowd going crazy on the dancefloor on a different tip phat admirer takes elements of ragga and fuses it with breaks ok so its not exactly a new thing - in fact it could be easily shown that the earliest breaks crossover tunes were in fact ragga breaks the things that made the tunes so good as have shown here are the massive feel good vocal samples the offbeat hands in the air style reggae hooks and of course the massive basslines - phat admirer dons a rather growly bassline with massive drops throughout while havent really broken any new territory (and it is pretty hard to do so) they have certainly brought a massive party element to this release and is quite a new direction for botchit breaks considering the output of their previous releases
richard d james may blow in and out of the public sphere but braindance the amorphous sub-genre spawned from his label rephlex continues to mutate and multiply this infectious blend of acid techno electro breakbeat and idm now populates all corners of the globe trawl the net long enough and youll find all sorts of strange gems one of them is a digital and cassette label with a striking visual aesthetic and sound run by erik levsen aka anonymous query you may not have encountered many of its artists before so the obscurity furthers the mystique vytear has been making brain bombs since the mid-90s but is his first record in about a decade its a massive nine-track compilation of unreleased tunes gleaned from his many hard drives the ep runs the braindance gamut from the breakneck scramble of to s dreamy ambient which isnt far from richard d jamess rhubarb the fat funk of is another standout along with s grimy electro is the best for a wonky acid trip an interlude of hammered notes and slightly detuned chords could be a cheeky riff from drukqs while the two versions of are for the speed freaks ep due out next year will feature new works and even faster stuff from a producer thankfully coaxed out of the shadows

apart from an outing for phonica earlier this year liam oshea has stuck to releasing his tough grainy house and techno on his vinyl-only seaghdha label having now shut down seaghdha the sheffield producer is reopening for business as named after the warehouse space that he runs in his home city extending the brand is likely to be a wise move as has rapidly built a rep for attracting some of dance musics most illustrious names to the site of this former armoury levon vincent ben klock and carl craig are just some whove played alongside residents oshea and veteran sheffield dj chris duckenfield over the past 12 months is made with a warehouse space in mind its piledriving beat leaves a vapour trail of reverb with each hit as evil synths are accompanied by a grossly distorted baritone its the kind of track that thrives in low-ceilinged post-industrial spaces doesnt have the evil charm of instead working its magic with a touch more subtlety there are nods to uk garage in its skipping hi-hats and to dubstep in its quaking bass and at one point a reconstructed amen break makes an appearance and if the heads-down bass workout of doesnt quite hit the standards set by the others it should at least be a useful tool
ill be honest ive always had a tough time telling and patrice scott apart musically over the course the past few years each has put forth beautiful and effective deep house records but only true heads are likely able to distinguish between the two that could easily change with worthys newest fering for his own label moments in rhythm vol 2 in contrast to the ya either love it or ya dont traditionalism scotts latest release worthy brings in some new elements to throw against his typically lush settings the influence here is a thin layer dub techno; the trio tracks are so brittle that you feel like you can poke a hand through them s the rocket on the cover intimates things here are decidedly more cosmic than before for worthy both thats (k-dubs and float but unlike previous work which saw him content to let those feelings resonate for an entire tracks length things move through different phases we see stars and planets and moons and all sorts other things on these journeys the best ride though is on the -side the motor mix is easily among the most complex tracks that worthy has put to wax but more important than the fact that it seems more labor-intensive is that it bangs hard the gossamer melody that floats through is an illusion designed to make you fall even more deeply into the groove in a career full deepness this might be his most fathomless cut yet
andrew atheralls vinyl-only bird scarer label went quiet after four releases in 2012 and 2013 but it now makes a welcome return with a four-tracker from long-time atherall associate given the ingrained nature of bird scarers signature style ( drug chug is atheralls way of putting it) its unsurprising that carries on where the previous records left off three of the four tracks pair chugging beds of bass and percussion (and i do mean chugging: the tracks are all between 100 and 110 bpm) with various synth flourishes is the pick its comatose bass punctuated by skittering keys and a sighing vocal refrain s flashes of light come from a chiptune-ish synth line and huge arcing squalls while has a lighter quality thanks to its fleet-footed drums the odd one out is which swaps the drama of the other cuts for a more propulsive edge the formulae on may be uncomplicated but the narcotic atmospheres gray creates are intoxicating
with each ep they produce alex jones and glimpse give us something different amid the pummeling techno theyre building a reputation for on dense pikas third release for hotflush the head-turner is the lead track the crushing kicks that open it may hint at a journey to the darkside but theyre very swiftly joined by a plaintive piano riff which sounds like its been culled from some early chicago house track secreting emotion with every key a barnstorming bassline distorted snares ghostly strings and space lots of it add up to as an emotionally-charged techno record that youll hear all year the other three tracks dont stir up such a sentimental response with two of them taking a more straight-ahead approach in the case of diabolic vocals heavy stabbed bass and a chopper blade rhythm combine to elicit a far more brutal reaction while hangs atmospheric growls electro burps and intense snares on a mid-paced groove recorded live in one take is dense pika at their most experimental stitching together tribal percussion blasts of eerie woodwind and frazzled modular synths
phon os starts demurely enough with a blippy arpeggio and tentative dub chords but from the moment the bass drops this is a big tune little bit zomby a little bit joy orbison it swaggers and soars in equal proportions with a 2-step cadence thats more lurch than swing crunchy clap/snare sound leads the groove; its loud but not too loud reverb-free and somehow exceptionally present you could almost call it cozy foghorn bass and cinematic strings earn the first half of its title s for the second its actually hard to find anything upbeat about the tune a unilateral brooder ut the skeletal drums move with a fleet step and the swelling strings explore denser and richer harmonies as they progress theres far more conflicted joy in the -side but for dark drama will do just fine

everybody wants to work with nina kraviz these days nd why not the young russians distinct voice and production style has added a wonderful twist to the catalogue of rekids and underground quality her voice meanwhile pops up on urban tribes newest effort and here she appears along with sascha funke on bpitch funke takes kraviz and sends her voice on to live among some of the murkiest house music that shes ever found herself within the sense of space on the track is remarkable; it feels as though its been produced in 3-d depth of this sort is nice for home listening of course but for dance floors reliant on upfront production techniques it doesnt make much sense funke provides a bonus version of the tune which puts everything into clear relief bass synths and voice no such concessions are made on the first half of the b-side however ptly titled the track wanders its way around kravizs muffled voice anchored by a stutter of a bassline gain its the type of track that begs for attention greater than your average clubber will give it considering it sounds different to almost anything that has come out in the past 12 months though you might be surprised by how many people who take the time to do so
s pool parties in spain have become an essential part summer for many this four-tracker from olivier mateu is squarely aimed at these events (sure enough the frenchman will play live at the first the labels weekly pool parties in ibiza) the title track the eps obvious standout is classic summer fare with expansive pads and bass and oscillating keys rolling like gentle tides over an ever-so-soulful male vocal given the focus the package re yous remix falls a surprising distance from the originals sun-bleached aesthetic it comes out as a tough blend crackling percussion and disorienting keys that should be more effective in the basement than by the pool on the flip and position themselves somewhere between these two environments (an indoor pool with the blinds pulled down perhaps) insistent basslines dominate both on the latter the arrival warm keys and cheery xylophones make for an uplifting closer

since 013 the tokyo label has been a place for artists to release albums of library music from balearic dons like tiago and jonny nash to homegrown producers like cos/mes its records are hand-painted and sold in limited runs ir conceit frees artists from the rules of the dance floor resulting in uncommonly evocative material it helps that run by 5ive one-half of cos/mes has direct connections to producers with the stylistic diversity and wide musical knowledge to make the releases special samo dj real name sam forsberg nyholm and maxxxbass real name max stenerudh are particularly well-suited for a album nyholms work runs the gamut hes made techno with skudge as four legs lo-fi house on his own and championed artists like powder via born the label he runs with sling stenerudh has released cassette albums of bizarre chillout music on born and trilogy tapes on the pair continue exploring the misty exoticism that defines their collaborative project kwc 9 with some pleasant and unexpected diversions re are two types of music on : the kind that would appear on a kwc 9 album and the kind that wouldnt in the former category offers chintzy orientalism like something youd hear while running through a temple in an old nintendo game is more intriguing beatless piece consists mostly of pensive rhodes and far-off chants and woodwinds as delicate and ephemeral as a morning fog s best moments however dont sound like kwc 9 one particularly strong section starts out with the ngola-referencing ambient piece which leads directly into album highlight here a marching-band snare is slathered with vocal samples that recall the disembodied r b of tri ngle records is a dance-pop tune that samples torch songs dont look w its one of a few cuts on that could score a driving scene along with the wonky dance track that comes next only one song here tops three and a half minutes maybe a reference to the balihu records boss given its spaced-out disco rhythm is a breezy 40 seconds you get the sense that nyholm and stenerudh had a lot of fun coming up with off-the-wall imagery and their corresponding soundtracks album closer is a bizarre operatic edit thats comically rife with drama duo likely wouldnt have released it had they not been making music for what they call a never seen science-fiction movie and thats the beauty of s concept it stretches producers to the limits of their musical imagination
ive generally associated productions with a certain back-to-basics ethic: no flashy effects no funny stuff just tightly constructed grooves with just enough oomph melodic textural rhythmic and often unquantifiable to make them really pop that strategy serves him well on his latest ep for which sounds as inspired as anything ive heard from him built atop a shimmying breakbeat and a jaunty little two-note bassline starts out modestly but it quickly opens up into phased swirling chords; over nine minutes that seem to pass in a fraction of the time it just keeps swelling and swelling buoyed by ascending arpeggios that wouldnt sound out of place in an emeralds record for occasions when something a little less pastoral is called for serves up four minutes of pure drum groove a smart addition to the record hot is more explicitly old-school with a mischievous bassline inspired by classic acid house; in the latter half a series of repeated vocal samples hot hot hot hot hot hot builds to a frenzy above staccato claps and snares also throws a glance backwards with a subtle nod to deee-lite and a nervous robo-disco bassline; it sounds a lot like the kind of thing classic music company might have released back in the day again it maintains a laser-like focus on the dance floor but no-frills doesnt mean one-dimensional : midway through the sinister mood gives way to a hazy eruption of soulful vocals that throw a reassuring light over it all before disappearing into the ether
room(s) was one of the breakthrough success stories of 0 it revealed real name travis stewart as one of the best producers of r b-laced electronica to emerge in the last four or five years it received a rare 5/5 on ra and finished number two in our albums of the year poll by then stewart had already been recording heat-dizzy idm and instrumental hip-hop for about a decade and yet it wasnt until the sweaty vocal-spliced jungle and footwork of room(s) that he really struck a chord for his first album since room(s) (and his debut for ) stewart decided to write a concept album illustrated by the grey-and-black industrial sprawl on the cover is about an imaginary metropolis; each of its ten tracks is devoted to one of its districts but if your eyes begin to roll at such a concept fear not: s brand of mesmerism is its own instant attraction room(s) fans will find plenty to grab onto from the rabid percussion and floor-bending bass of to the cathartic piano-laced footwork of or the speed-blurred vocals of but what really marks s growth are the moments that subtly push stewarts sound into small stylistic corners only hinted at before hes noted the influence of boards of canada in interviews and both and draw directly from the duos eerie urban bucolica is two and a half minutes of gas-eous drone that softens the setting before entering the albums more diverse second half and seasea is the sort of free floating jazz-inflected hip-hop that flylo does so well but perhaps the biggest curveball is the slo-mo fuzzgaze of which features stewarts cloudy vocals and wouldnt have sounded out of place on the last washed out lp these small detours only emphasize the breadth of stewarts vision as he continues to reroute s sonic voyage
following last years brilliant rp boo lp and traxmans dusty offering from now showcase another footwork veteran debuted on dance mania in 1998 (and a couple of his ghetto house productions from this period were reissued on blank mind in ) as with traxman his age seems to have given him a keen awareness of his musical heritage the title track of his new ep nods to footworks roots in chicago house by riffing on an 88 acid classic mike dunns magic clents interpretation is loose but the stark sci-fi oddness of the original is preserved albeit accelerated to panic-inducing speeds the result sounds like an emergency klaxon echoing through a failing spaceship clents meanwhile slices the lurid p-funk classic atomic into garbled shapes replacing the grinding sensuality of the original with a sort of scratchy angst in both cases the goal clearly isnt to push our nostalgia buttons so much as create unsettling new affects something clent does with considerable success even romance that most comforting of subject matters becomes unsettling in his hands both dont and dont refract lovelorn themes through a paranoiac lens only in does sentimentality win out and only just
at the heart of it minimal dance music is a tug-of-war between personality and economy when hes in his best form dutch producer nails the balance just check out last years sprawling album ghost to coast or one of his three-hour live sets but the last time he appeared on for 2014s mr nubilous his tendency for minimalism got the best of him he makes up for it on a three-tracker featuring two great tunes that show off his friskier side lengthy a-side ly is touted as a big moment for ludwig mostly because it includes his vocals but its really just a serviceable club tune full of springy drums and webbed basslines those sounds occasionally make way for ethereal vocals that sound like they wafted over from a bob moses rehearsal feeling more like a gimmick than a carefully considered expression flipside makes worth picking up title cut is bold skating on a downcast chord progression that coats the background in warm autumnal colours percussions moreish skip really sells the track with complex but intuitive drum programming that outpaces the a-side me is even more approachable full of shiny hi-tech synths and filtered drums that wade through thick atmospherics like the best moments of ghost to coast s b-side speaks to how much personality ludwig can cram into pared-down frameworks

might think that theres little reason for s to be 12 minutes long at the three minute mark but give it about nine minutes or so and let me know what you think then the lead track on the s fourth various artist compilation ep reveals itself to need every second of its length to explore just about every nook and cranny of its groove moving from industrial distortion to jacking house and back again its yet another random producer ive never heard of before on and its one of the reasons that the label has been one of the most exciting imprints of the past year or so over the course of these four vinyl you never know what youre going to get name wise just know that its going to be weird and wonderful speaking of which s acid workout is just the sort of thing that steve reich would make if he were just starting out the phasing is almost dizzying and then theres break sls brother whose slow moving pl tschern has just enough room in its resolutely forward facing groove to allow for a dreamy synth to waver in and out of focus for nine minutes with the dresden label set to jettison the various artist comps for proper artist led eps in the near future these sorts of delights will be a thing of the past on the label but with a ring this tight the results look to be just as promising for the future of

obscure sound chee shimizus book devoted to unusual music is divided into sections far more evocative than standard genre tags: spiritual cosmic meditative mellow floating pensive tucked away at the back of the book in a section marked groovy is a self-titled album by japanese outfit released in 1981 on better days it featured ichiko hasimoto and atsuo fujimoto who together led the project and a cast of supporting musicians theyre the latest 80s-era japanese act to get another look following mariah and dip in the pool as with mariahs utakata no hibi bears its influences uk synth pop us new wave and minimal avant-garde jazz but stands apart as a singular creation shimizu re-edits two songs from the title track and for a 7-inch on japanism a new label hes started with hmv japan his take on maintains the originals slap bass-fuelled punk-funk its at once urgent and relaxed catchy yet supremely odd with a few wrinkles ironed out so its easier to play in clubs that said its not an overly sanitised edit: shimizu keeps the screwy synth line reminiscent of the industrial noise that made severed heads dead eyes opened too abrasive to be a mainstream pop hit shimizu nails it on a track that was also edited by howard williams aka japan blues for berceuse heroique in 2014 built around a drum machine loop this version sounds remarkably like classic deep house the beauty of these edits is that shimizu has shaped them into club-friendly tracks while keeping the strangeness that made them so appealing in the first place

the press release for this collaboration between alveol and vocalist kachurkova their first for the nascent stem label calls the record interesting tripped-out material that description is only half accurate s is indeed strange and difficult to fully comprehend but its about as interesting as a play-by-play of someones first mushrooms trip at moments across it feels like two records are playing together mashed in an uncomfortable mix to let roll on for almost 10 minutes is overly indulgent particularly since by the time its synths fade out its difficult to actually remember anything about the track both versions of are equally empty and would fit comfortably onto a late 90s chillout compilation a resonant bassline at least offers some structure to the herzel and remix but the veil version stretches a handful of ideas out into an aimless 12 minutes that feels twice as long the one light in the dark is lake s sparkling remix of the fat is trimmed the wooliness is discarded and from what was indistinct emerges a slab of atmospheric techno thats locked in place with a snare drum like a blacksmiths hammer it probably still doesnt need to run for seven minutes but compared with its neighbours it seems pleasantly brief
the second record isnt as good as the first one but you can see what its trying to do was a deep dive into technos trippy nether regions where melodies were carried through the murk like mysterious sea creatures on underwater currents its follow-up dives deeper still and with dramatic results even if the projects anonymous producer sometimes loses their bearings down there goes deepest and longest from the start its spindly drums struggle to cut through thick layers of fx; things only get more cloudy and turbulent over the following ten minutes at some point a minor-key arp appears flashing like fish scales in the dark and whispering voices leave broad wakes of reverb behind them as a body trip it doesnt quite work but as a head trip its intense the rest of the ep focusses on the two elements of s music in turn ditches the drums to let the atmospheres breathe with morse code bleeps and gothy synth chords lurking without saying much features s sturdiest drums at first the extra power is refreshing giving the tracks dancing arps a bit more thrust but even that thumping kick drum is eventually drowned in a deluge of synth pads leaving you cold disorientated and looking for a way back to the surface

ive seen sam beatch and sebastian davidson rock a party at remarkably relaxed tempos it takes the vancouver duo a while to stir up their grooves but once they do theyre infectious theres usually a point about ten to 20 minutes in when everyone suddenly gets it though theyve been around for a few years is their first album and their reputation (at least locally) is largely built on their excellent live performances as it turns out they come off well on record too and theyre the latest in a line of relatively obscure vancouver artists to land on on beatch and davidson are as nonchalant as ever the formula goes something like this: a handful of processed samples are finely chopped up into percussive notes and longer melodic smears then arranged into off-kilter dance tracks with the exception of a voice deadpanning the word house (as well as the duos name) a few times the human presence is limited to miniature grunts most of the sounds use are microscopic but theyre often bunched up to make a stronger impression on were presented with a hobbling raw clump of sound like we caught the duo before they were quite ready but give them a minute and they untangle those elements letting the song slip into an easy saunter you can hear the creative process at work with an abstract array of beeps and bloops that gets retooled into a peppy club track on the dance edit that follows on the duo show that their psychedelic sweeps can be funnelled layer by layer into rushing techno s shorter sketches like and are strong as well distilling the duos essence into bite-sized chunks they show a fondness for dreamier sounds: the ambient interlude b is strikingly ornate and uses long lazy brushstrokes of melody as if the two musicians were absent-mindedly doodling this casual attitude defines much of and it might be s greatest attribute

theres that old saying that advises never judge a book by its cover while that might be true for literature when it comes to music ive come to think that premature judgment is an excellent filter when navigating mammoth amounts of digital music an artist who dons the name dj euthanasia for instance is unlikely to make the classiest of tunes by the same token a cheap cover often indicates cheap music (direct your eyes to the right and see where im going with this ) admittedly half the reason from caught my eye was because of the ridiculous title however the concept is mildly interesting an accomplished saxophone player took a break from touring with long-time pranksters detroit grand pubahs in order to put this together the result: elementary dubstep with lashings of sax on top in the title track it doesnt actually sound too bad with a single tenor sax hugging the shuddering bassline it even manages to sound a little suave the other two tracks cant get there though using trite instrumentation and only the blandest of programming for jazzy dubstep look elsewhere ben neills night science for example

hot on the heels of the recent are-they-or-arent-they live controversy ed bangers own superstars have released a tour documentary a cross the universe which is accompanied (somewhat) ironically by live in san francisco an album that encapsulates the madness of the concert experience whether they do it live or not and no matter what qualms you might have had about them when their first studio album was released last year ( know had mine) it is clear that in terms of perfectly replicating the crowd-devastating ultra-compressed garage band-induced aural carnage of the live happening this cd is la shit b b and resistance to it is pretty much futile at this point the debate about pre-recorded sequences and so-called authenticity of performance seems quite pointless: vocals from uffie ( e ) or simian ( ) for instance are treated like convenient samples during the show just like the various bits taken from goblin franz ferdinand klaxons soulwax ministry or metallica pop music nowadays is less about origins and originality than it is about execution and experience principles gaspard and xavier appear to have mastered to devastating effect the disappearance of any actual singing presence on stage coupled with the fact themselves are literally drowning to the point of invisibility under (probably) useless equipment only serve to enhance the very physicality of their live interpretations headbanging in others words is aptly justified here considering how the listeners are the songs real stars n the end you dont need a phd in semiology to decipher how the iconic stacking of marshall amps surrounding a glowing cross on stage fittingly embodies the parisians perfectly formed rationale the glorious their brutal version of and the grandiose master of puppets -sampling are songs of faith and devotion that transcend generic barriers just like all perennial pop music does oh and the way screams from the audience are intertwined with their especially dramatic rendition of is proof enough of the in-sync authenticity of the entire experience after listening to s live in san francisco going back to your daily everyday routine will feel a little more mundane and ordinary than usual whether the duo played the music live or not n these cynical post-post-post-post-modern jaded times of ours this is a small achievement in itself
with last years designated 41 ep for fifth wall jordon saxton (working under the name unklone) proved that his passage from bass-heavy house to dark techno was all but complete but while that record took a maximal approach the leeds producers return to duty as toggles the venetian blinds on his studio windows to let some light in (saxtons song titles suggest an obsession with all things japanese) is beautifully simple while a three-note motif buzzes around the core of the track gently morphing in shape if not intensity saxton slashes at the gaps in between with twisted metallic percussion on the trippy textures of are eschewed in favour of a rollicking techno stomp its jarring bass aggressively sucking air into the speakers while laser-gun bursts light up the atmosphere whatever flavour of techno attempts it always seems to hit the sweet spot

hailing from a scene where weirdos thrive stockholms stands out for his remarkably skewed approach though hes released a lot of music over the past half-decade the variation in his productions as well as his work with the likes of yung lean makes it difficult to pin down where hes coming from (a video feature following the young producer around stockholm did little to clear things up ) but the highlights in his catalog like 2014s palats and 2015s intr stellr reveal his knack for cubist house romps his latest record lands on will bankheads and is built around a couple of alien filter-house cuts se three tunes feel like a gradual descent into madness kicked off by the title track s essentially an edit with a disco diva who isnt gwen mccrae singing the chorus the fire burning while the band plays behind her stiltz seems to have a full understanding of the tension and release needed to succeed in this format as he spends three minutes letting the vocals emerge from a murky zone but then the tune rides on for another five minutes s a clever tool but you likely wont hear the full track being played out is also built around a stompy disco sample this time he not only rides the filters he balances the funk with atonal b-movie bleeps best track on is the bizarre closer s s initially reminiscent of the kind of pumping minimal house cut villalobos might reach for at the witching hour but stiltz works in reggae toasting spoken word and an ominous barely perceptible piano line this kind of dubby haphazard house track fits with the sued/sex tags/acido axis ample proof that the odd young man from stockholm should go as far out of orbit as he wants
it wasnt long ago that vetts decided hed had enough of doing edits or more fairly using samples really well; the very skill which had individuated him since 2005 the result of that decision was stone reaker his debut lp and initial foray into from-scratch production which brings us to ; a 12-inch containing two cuts one lifted from stone reaker and delivered a year after the fact evetts tack here is reminiscent of steffi smooth chicago-inflected house with a flawless modern sheen the original version of is set atop a catchy but unassertive bass groove from end to end this sequence anchors various other hooks which patiently take turns in the limelight most of the action is in the mid-section where benign keyboards pedestrian hand drums and pitch-bent quasi-acid chords play together in harmony ut the tracks real character is in the top end where brightly-hued chords streak overhead bestowing a sense of utter calm these synths are mostly kept intact for (space dub) a track which feels weirdly ambivalent in place of the wandering bass motif theres an impelling rhythm section but its momentum is muzzled by the placid harmonies in which its immersed s a result it feels like riding a rocket in a dream with all the danger and noise excised but the wonder and thrill remaining neither cut uses samples clearly evetts has plenty to show the world yet
many producers with s superhuman level of technical nous make music that feels like an exercise lthough his productions are notably precise they usually break out of a framework rather than perfect a formula you can hear this in the -side of his latest 12-inch and 2014s one stitch follows nother where unruly effects momentarily gate and squash the entire mix as if the sound is trying to burst through the fourth wall ut while tracks like clk recovery and gnes demise are almost hilariously extravagant his overall aesthetic leans towards the steely and synthetic 4 however introduces a sense of playfulness to s sound thanks to sampled breaks and hints of 2-step garage bears some resemblance to one stitch follows nother both use restrained techno as a platform for pyrotechnic accents that flare out of the speakers contrasting effects some plosive and pitched others washy and sustained jump above the mix with a clarity and impact enhanced by understated drums and surgical e ing the care with which the atmospheric elements are sequenced gently builds the tension before our first taste of breaks jacks the energy levels in another direction these breaks add a refreshing organic edge to s sound design the track passes through a range of dynamics in the middle third traversing eye-popping intensity and subdued serenity its the sort of tune that demands to be played in full has a spring in its step it has pitched down 2-step groove while the central lead line sounds like it was made with house organ preset 1 these sassy elements in combination with snatches of vocal and another hefty dose of breaks make s most light-hearted track so far the central breakdown is particularly flamboyant developing into a delightful sequence of flourishes punctuated by subtle yet sharp drops in the volume that renew the grooves impact s ever the balancing between the bass elements is superb whatever you play next is going to have a hard time standing up to the sound design
samurai has been knocking on technos door for years with its horo sub-label moving away from drum bass conventions entirely s the descent (chapter 1) ep from earlier this year is a prime example its dense and atmospheric dance music that doesnt fit neatly into any box and wouldnt have been out of place on a label like stroboscopic rtefacts making that connection clear steps in to combine the tracks from the 12-inch into two remixes it marks samurais first real foray into techno while keeping its anything-goes outlook intact s originals cut a shuddering post-apocalyptic figure which makes them ripe for interpretation by the likeminded stroboscopic boss s remixes are nearly as ambitious in execution as they are in scope (together they almost stretch to 30 minutes) his is the one for djs a techno odyssey that builds a tidal wave before receding into an abstract digital soundscape the slightly shorter is more arty the kind of swampy electronica all rattling chains and eerie drones that saves for his albums oth remixes are defined by his impeccable talent for atmospherics and detailing but whats even more noteworthy is how close they sound to a regular release if it werent for s credit on the sleeve you might never guess there was something unusual about this 12-inch which says a lot about the enviable position samurai holds in experimental electronic music
i must admit i didnt really get at first his debut 12-inch on running back for instance bore grizzly beats and melodies that seemed haphazardly slapdash given their prominence what i failed to realise at the time was that korn was peddling music from a new scale that brought with it a new kind of funk his palette of tunes and timbre is markedly his own and thats why hes interesting none find him more so than panorama bars steffi whose imprint has devoted two of its first three releases to the dresdeners work this second one is arguably his finest yet two pensive numbers both intensely textured and are as fit for club as they are for personal house catharsis he applies thick layers of sound from the bottom up and melodies are allowed to reverberate in between the opening bass quiver in for example sits solidly but quietly under a stemming crest of padded chords oscillators and a lacquer of strings as the patchwork slowly sheds its seams the totality of sound is similarly effective in but here attention is grabbed by the powerfully-packed kick and old-school percussive elements that are warped very much into the nu-school as if the package needed buffer dexter and john are charged with remix duties and both are nifty in their handling of dexter pushes the tempo and chimes in with some teeming chords while wisely opts for a touch of acid vogue in tracks that are nevertheless indebted to their originator
lives in norwich but hes always seemed at home in londons concrete jungle his music tirelessly explores its crooked streets encountering the citys musical styles from fresh angles his new album however hints at urban fatigue theres the title and the sleeve photo which shows a pink balloon floating free of greying urban architecture the opening track is a grand beatless number full of swelling chords and sweeping melody t sounds less like a uk dance floor mutation than a pitch to score blade runner 049 on that track and handles this new filmic formula with his usual deft touch but it turns out these are little more than sojourns from the city and before long hes pounding familiar streets sometimes a bit too familiar: reprises the melancholic garage sound of his late 00s beginnings and a vocal from jamakabi cant keep it from sounding dated other tracks however show how it pays to repeat a formula s been riffing on jungle since at least 0 4 and and suggest that hes still got tricks up his sleeve each contorts lithe breakbeats into ever wilder shapes the effect is spooky on the former where divas and ragga mcs moan like digital ghouls and lighter on the latter with its dip-diving snare rolls and bright melodies grime comes in the crosshairs too with jendor shakes up a fairly standard 40 bpm rhythm spiky clap patterns stern synth-string melody with a hailstorm of clever micro-detail the instrumental is refreshing as well with its cascade of sci-fi blips and skronks clever beat fake-outs and smokebombs of reverb going by these tracks escape is exactly what this album isnt ts as immersed in uk dance culture and beholden to s usual habits and preoccupations as anything hes released in the past decade but the producer still finds ways to surprise you calls back to grime but it snakes along circa 90 bpm its minor-key melody and pulse -style kick drum framed by a skeletal dembow rhythm s music might not be leaving the city any time soon but a holiday in the caribbean could do him a world of good
over the past year or so industrial techno has become something of an easy target particularly for those looking to diagnose the ills of underground dance music (hell even levon vincent got in on the action ) in fairness the critics arent entirely without merit: waves of young producers have flooded the market with abrasive sounds that claim alliance with ebm and industrial music but often go no deeper than a tossed-off front 242 or nitzer ebb reference adam x aka adam mitchell doesnt fall into that category the brooklyn native and sonic groove co-founders credentials date back to the earliest days of the new york city rave scene his exploration of industrial and ebm began in earnest during the early 00s long before those sounds became fashionable in techno circles mitchell relocated to berlin in the mid-00s and in recent years hes been increasingly active under the - moniker his project largely eschews throttling techno rhythms instead delving into downtempo excursions through ambient and industrial soundscapes coherent abstractions is the third - album and arrives via l i e s who also released last years the redacted files ep coherent abstractions quickly sets a bleak tone as opens with what sounds like a possessed dentist drill the albums entire first half is steeped in dread although the drexciyan flourishes of and the twinkling idm touches in prove mitchell isnt entirely indebted to the dark side nevertheless those seeking punishment will hit pay dirt in s ominous plod and the digital overload of which includes a sort of monologue from mitchell its followed by the only other vocal number the churning whose guest appearance by is both seductive and menacing given mitchells extensive history its no surprise that from a production standpoint the lp is incredibly solid and a far cry from the amateurism often associated with producers using a similar sound palette that said the album shines brightest during its final four tracks when mitchell comes away from industrial may include twisting distortion but the song cruises at 110 bpm leaning on a simple (and surprisingly catchy) synth melody and birdlike electronic flourishes the nervy energy of pairs nicely with its noodling keys while both stical and marry clattering drums with a pleasantly light melodic touch adam x may have spent his career exploring the dark underbelly of electronic music but coherent abstractions shows that hed be well served by sometimes moving into the light
after more than five years of mostly self-released digital tracks (plus lengthy 2012 digital lp on sleep is commercial) israeli artist returns with his first solo vinyl ep for tel avivs records it features two original cuts that prove his off-kilter take on techno and house is as vibrant and inviting as ever along with fine remixes from inland (aka ed davenport) and label heads deepa and echoed organ lines fly skittishly through the mix on the title track which moves between long spaced-out pauses and passages with nuanced tribal percussion anchored by a low but steady kick drum is calmer and more easygoing as conjures light drones noodly basslines and a water-like effect that sounds as if it might trickle right out of your speakers on the flip are two tough and direct remixes of geared for dj use inland offers a near-total rework and a very ravey one at that where only a sliver of the originals unsettled riffs can be heard beneath an almost frantic synth lead and some dense hi-hat and cymbal work deepa and s sleek shadowy interpretation is more faithful to the source material and finds a middle ground between the originals heady ambience and inlands intense take come for some cozy jams from and stay for the floor-ready remixes
s music has all the calling cards of the uks new house sound: pitched-down r b vocals melodically-driven structures a certain post-club sweetness but his productions have always had a crustiness to them a taste for sonic grot and clotted swing that wards off the anodised feeling common among his peers s such vynehall has the potential to go to interesting places; unfortunately with his third ep he seems content with treading water tempers its muscular thump with over-warm pads while tinny snippets of vocal and a messy hi-hat overlay dont quite succeed in bringing the weird 7 is more striking taking the now familiar formula for a contemporary uk house banger and turning it on its head everythings fuggy and just slightly off centre but the edge of menace found in say gold language is sorely missed vynehall follows the contour of his last release by finishing with a woozy slow-jam intriguingly s string-like pads and lethargic bump recall the fuzzy hypnagogic hip-hop of cupp cave and dynooo more than anything found on uk dance floors with any luck this is our man preparing to leap off into the unknown

theres next to no information available about the two producers whose tracks inaugurate new london based label and this first 12 inch sneaked out in a limited hand stamped run the musical aesthetic is subtly different from the majority of whats currently around in house and techno especially in the uk based on extended intricately detailed grooves whose painstaking slowness and trippy repetition owe a great deal to mid 00s perlon the presence of forebears like ricardo villalobos and thomas melchior is especially noticeable in s which contrasts clipped beats with a background of watery swishes and splashes its a lovely svelte thing whose rhythmic details appear to slope forward at the end of each bar to transfer their kinetic energy effortlessly to the next s is similarly dry and stripped down but feels more of a piece with current producers influenced by those luminaries its blank pulses of sub bass and swung drums recall earlier music by kowton especially his first 12 inches for idle hands and keysound and its downbeat and subtly funky enough to sit comfortably alongside the likes of lowtec and kassem mosse the attention to detail on both tracks and the way they wring such depth from essentially simple source material is impressive for a debut release if indeed thats what this is; with their enigmatic and vaguely teasing artist names these could plausibly be the work of more experienced producers in disguise

now three years into the series the title rhythms of the pacific has gone from sounding vaguely kitschy to seriously evocative highlighting a sound that has crystallized around canadas west coast the labels first two releases showcased some of vancouvers best house music sounding dazed dreamy and effortlessly groovy another autumn brings another volume of rhythms and the third might just surpass the first two aka sam scott a familiar face in vancouvers afterhours scene makes his production debut on the a side over two long cuts scott goes for the kind of spaciousness associated with labels like soul people music and underground quality is a chunky late summer groover made of lightweight elements like hand percussion vocal gasps funky wah wah and a shimmering melody touching on pender street steppers sound is also serene with buried horns and wobbly synth tones on the other side s (tomis shows off his sense of restraint with precise percussion and an acid lead that squiggles within the lines a producer also known as esb or elka (and who released the underrated chants on 1080p this year) contributes exemplary of the canadian riviera style its a heavy lidded jazzy groover thats spiced up with a drum break striking a balance between laid back and lively
the concept of seems simple enough: take the talented james zabiela and nic fanciulli put them together and let them mix create rework scratch and abuse music simple concept where the answer invariably should be two but it took a night at ministry of sound to show me that the two separate elements do not always add up their music clashed at times the edges were a bit jagged ut the partnership isn t just a djing one; they ve also teamed up in the studio which is more of an unknown quantity production-wise fanciulli seems to have a golden touch his recent cut lucky heather updated both french kiss and the progressive genre but zabiela is more of an unknown quantity (he s been hit and miss: the robot voices in robophobia were especially out of place and irritating) ack to the dancefloor at ministry where towards the end of the night the delightfully smooth strings and floating melodies of put the confusion and directionless of the rest of the night into perspective it combines james raw gritty side with popping digital effects and nic s traditional ear with some beautifully crafted string patterns it s a great production: it has direction it has emotion and it is the result of james and nic hitting the same wavelengths in the studio however isn t in the same league there s some nice frog like croak effects here a low-end booty shaking bass there but much like a book that builds to a dud ending it leaves you wanting so the jury is still out on james and nic as a dj pairing and as a production duo too but the quality of proves the concept of has merit if is the evidence there is no reason why adding one and one shouldn t regularly double the outcome

walls dimensions scott monteith (aka ) wrestles with loss and pain in ways hes rarely attempted eight-track album reflects the tumultuous period when he wrote it losing a loved one in a tragic acci nt being forced to confront the crooked nature of the music industry and contemplating why the wi r world was falling apart at the seams were the factors that led monteith into a truly dire period of existential crisis and pression t makes walls dimensions the canadian artists most poignant record to date though there are effective instrumentals on the album walls dimensions often looks to vocalists to help convey its emotional content bleak opener aint enlists to add weary downtrod n soul to its ep dub pulses finds dehlia de reinterpreting lines from the classic dylan thomas poem do t go gentle nto that good night into long-win d (at times even guttural) vocal passages n this case the vocals come off overcooked but the way the music subtly chugs and builds momentum goes a long way to making work is one of the records most hopeful efforts as bicers words of encouragement are gently layered over a swinging beat bolstered by catchy sub-bass monteith gets even more direct sparse rumbling opens with an excerpt about why those tired of being sick and tired and fed up [with] the bullshit can be pushed to violence similarly album standout opens with a clip remarking on how all one can do when things are so fucking unfair is to keep on pushing manipulated throughout the tracks seven-minute run that pitched-down keep on pushing sample anchors static-lined drones and cyclical melodic patterns which is pleasantly reminiscent of s nfinity dubs productions despite their pronounced presence the vocal contributions to walls dimensions dont steal the spotlight from its masterful productions this is monteiths tenth full-length and you can tell his ep immersive strain of dubby house and techno is so well fined it can illustrate and contemplate his world views as if to acknowledge thats a lot to take in monteith conclu s with s a 15-minute ambient meditation rich with tail ts a space to breathe and process everything walls dimensions has to say
creating a niche for oneself as a remixer is something a double edged sword no matter how gifted a producer may be at reinterpreting and recontexualising a piece music its hard to believe that any artist would willingly become known as the person whose best ideas are literally the sum someone elses parts the best and most successful remixers idiosyncracy is the key; recent remix collections dj koze and carl craig attest to that s de collection will likely receive less attention than kozes and craigs releases presumably in part because he rarely allows for interviews or other forms self promotion but it deserves to be considered in the same regard existing at the fringes french touch hype in the late 990s via tracks like burnt the enigmatic producer was seemingly unaffected when the genre fell out favour over the last decade or so he has continued to release an average one inch per year via his own atavisme imprint and all the while he has quietly amassed a huge and varied collection remixes uniqueness ocks productions ten lies within the looseness the mix bass is ten muffled the pads undefined and the rhythmic accompaniments anything from mouth sounds and jerky breath noises to wooden block percussion electronica fuzz and jazz samples are unexpected layered and jostle for attention ts an entirely precarious combination but somehow totally balanced at the same time and its the same with his remixes: res never a sense that ock intentionally sets out to create a dance floor bomb or a moody dub mix hes simply rewriting the content with his own quirky vocabulary although all the remixes de have received special tweaking and editing by ock for this collection thats secondary to the achievement actually sourcing and collating this in the first place two particularly hard to find remixes make this worth the price the entry alone: his strings n bass collaboration with jackson as panash and the sublime afro house rework 6s from the late nuphonic records which has been all but lost since the labels demise elsewhere ocks remixes are an exercise in embracing the unexpected another welcome inclusion is his refix s taken from the club sodade remix project the portugese singer while another better known remix the same track by carl craig became an instant club favourite ocks take is a brooding restrained affair with a cheeky narcotic groove and dubbed out vocals similarly the sometimes saccharine house harmonies atlanta duo are beefed up in ocks hands with less drippy romance and more urgent masculinity and the chill out darlings accessibility become almost unrecognisable morphing into a group occupying unsettling reverbed atmospheric electronica territory courtesy his mix a title that could be applied to just about every single refix here
is certainly making a name for himself in after a very impressive 005 he is establishing himself as one of the best new talents in the uk coming out on the tom s label does what he does best with track starts well immediately hitting you with a driving bass beat before incandescently dropping a very unexpected piano key this is then perfectly complimented with a funky string sound just as you start to think where is this going to lead kicks in his trademark electro tones and get this baby right on course electro grind continues in a very fat way before dropping away allowing the piano and strings to take over it is this half way mark where the tune really grabs me fading back the piano and strings before kick in with a thumping bass line and electro mayhem once again the standard of production shows why is really carving his own niche perfect tune to drop in the middle of a main room set on the flip side of this sees tom step to the plate and mix it up for his good buddy i am not sure if the competitive juices were flowing here as one was trying to out do the other but tom really nails this remix with a slightly darker and bouncer bass tom pushes the electro edge that little bit further with great success again the tune drops away nicely in the middle as the piano and strings feature prominently this then builds at a perfect tempo and crescendos with a heavier more electronic bass nice overall another very impressive release from and a cracking remix from tom production is top quality and to be honest what you would expect from two men who are in top form
pikes a nightclub and hotel thats seen plenty of rock star style indulgence since opening in the late 70s is the stuff of legend its unlikely though that the spot still bears witness to the debauchery of its glory days when the likes of spandau ballet grace jones and bianca jagger prowled the grounds in search of kicks its founder and spiritual leader ny pike who still lives at the hotel is now 83 and pikes was just the subject of an article in times titled and the middle aged ravers in which the current proprietor ndy ckay admits that hes catering to those with a little less stamina for dancing until 6 of the subjects of that feature harvey has recently been appointed pikes cultural attach his full duties arent entirely clear but among them is overseeing the launch of its not surprising then that the label is making its debut with the harvey curated a compilation that takes its name and ethos from his ercury residency at pikes in a room named after freddie ercury ( late queen frontman celebrated his 41st birthday at the hotel according to times with 350 bottles of o t chandon champagne and a cake in the shape of barcelonas sagrada fam lia church ) selections for the most part are typical examples of the balearic style vibe is as predictable as it is pleasurable coustic six string guitars strum choruses brim with oohs and aah nd sun dappled melodies welcome all comers rhythms move blissfully sometimes with an iberian lilt sometimes with a jaunty disco tinged bounce others have a serenely lysergic chug contributes a song that embodies the compilations overall sound beatbox taps out a syncopated tick tock underneath a placid percolating synth and minor key guitar picks spectral vocal snippets meander and string stabs build a bit of tension it sounds simple (and it is) but it has a subtly hedonistic charge thats hard to resist the duos 2012 tribute to the late hawkes is another standout its rubber dub groove graced by a quietly joyous piano all of works with the same degree of subtlety shes dy from re is a flamboyant disco throwback that stays just on the right side of syrupy thanks to a hazy electric piano that anchors the tune s breezy dell cqua with its vocal syncopation good time horns and near comedic percussion has a novelty hit feel but its a good fit for the compilations dreamland aura its easy to give into that aura and the best track here is the dreamiest of them all fingers remix of s el swoons and sighs and shuffles a soundtrack to a sky blue reverie s with much of sound of ercury it feels unbound by era it could have been made in the 70s or yesterday (its from 2011 ) lso like the rest of the compilation its exactly the kind of music youd find at an intimate gathering on a island with harvey at the helm
following three solid techno efforts for horizontal ground and black sun records (the manchester duo of andro and dimit) return to their dubstep roots with their latest ep this time for but before we lose ye techno purists entirely heed that this is -style dubstep of the swinging throbbing variety that was first aired in 2009 via the pensive mindset imprint teases open the four tracker with hissing snares and spitting electronic soundbites before unleashing its pounding core from and descend into far dubbier territories formed from broken steppy skeletons both are fleshed with spacy chords and voluptuous reverb in two delicious examples of dubstep-techno crossover saying that s productions here stand up alone and are quite removed from any label or sound affiliations in a cluttered era rife with appropriation appear to be forging something rare a distinct voice a remix from tom rounds off on a tech house tip adding purring hit-hats and groove to the tracks enveloping dub fog
lately has been making deep house sound mystical whether were talking outer space exploration or the subtropical atmospheres of last years the smoke clears lp for his first release of which comes on one track the irishman drives his cosmic car to detroit and combines the subaquatic with the astral (if the title wasnt enough of a hint) the full mix is all about the liquid synths which sit on a gentle foundation of characteristically soft drums and a bassline that couldve been ripped right out of a prime era model 500 record warm and inviting like techno comfort food the track motors on for eight minutes without much interruption its pure contentment the shorter deep mix isnt dramatically different but it feels more spacious kicking it up to a less languorous pace the ep is rounded off by the rhythm section mix which is exactly what it promises even just the drums and bassline of make for a pretty good tune like so much of dalys work its not going to melt your face but theres something pleasing about such consistency
a berlin-based techno producer whose releases span more than two decades has been a staple of ben klocks record bag for a while one factor behind lauxs longevity is an uncommon versatility records like there is no return and souldancer came out within a year of each other (97 and 98) but their contents sound polarised still it took a chance encounter on a flight to make happen its telling that these tracks recall the warm analogue glow of lauxs 90s material the acid mix of pairs a two-note phrase with chopping orchestral synth chords while the original has a neat hum of white noise instead of pulsing 303 lines both versions take similar routes to get to where theyre going but the textural changes in the acid mix are more dynamic and appealing with only shakers hi-hats and a downbeat string of toms in its beat sounds almost weightless held together by a viscous synth loop that flows through the expanse its an elegant addition to lauxs ep and likely to find itself at the beginning of more than a few techno sets
in a between-genre world where playful vibrancy is key sam schorb stands (or rather flails) in a permanent state of epileptic fit the only thing holding him in place is the straightforward house rhythms that he chooses over the 2-step skip of many of his would-be garage contemporaries nonetheless his first 12-inch for keysound (who will release his debut album later this year) features his most careful focused track yet ridin darts determinedly and decisively as schorb keeps his arpeggios reined in rather than letting them run buck-wild like usual even as the songs helium gangsta chorus chants its title the other three tracks are business as usual for schorb and both see returning to the easel with his fingerpaints haphazardly splotching the canvas with runs of giddy melody the former continues s perversion of r b tropes while the latter finds him successfully incorporating 8-bit bleeps and bloops the ep is rounded out with karolinas a suitably weird concoction of wonkily descending riffs and strange vocal samples something like girl unit on a bad trip
theres often something especially satisfying about a techno ep that has peak time material from start to finish the latest on planet rhythm features exactly that courtesy of and the former handles the a side with two tracks that epitomise the funky bass heavy style hes been dishing out from his berlin base for the past few years begins as a fairly straightforward roller but soon morphs into a disorienting droning collage of synths is funkier still with a big snare and loud hats edging it towards house territory moody contributions sit on the flip both are more atmospheric than s selections but just as tough is the most mellow track here but thats not saying much its dark and kicks hard though its simplicity should make it a handy tool for djs looking to build some tension like the eps opener also has a short in your face synth melody coupled with a simple mostly snare less beat regardless of which track the needle lands on techno jocks in command of an energetic dance floor should be glad to have this record in their bag
throughout his tenure as a member of prolific ambient adventurers emeralds as well as his concurrent solo work has never appeared to lack creative energy however following the 2012 release of sequitur his second album the cleveland-based artist quietly brought that steady flow of original material to a standstill whether intentional or not the break in output appears to have given hauschildt time to examine his craft three years later hes emerged with his most distinctive record to date hauschildts first solo triumph 2011s excellent tragedy geometry was more free-flowing kosmiche than a comprehensive statement contrast is unmistakably infused with intention record is imbued with a noticeably darker hue from the start wrapping widescreen orchestral chords in thick layers of astral mist on opener nd rarely strays from the serious tone appropriately titled weaves prickly synth patterns atop muffled piano before transitioning into a solemn melodic coda times fits a handful of contemplative melodies between shifting layers of buoyant keys and muted chords pulls charging arpeggios out from a dense bed of synthetic strings hauschildts transition to slightly darker and at times vaguely symphonic sounds proves to be an excellent framework for his compositional strengths both in emeralds and as a solo producer hauschildt has always been adept with touching melodies keen sense for natural progression makes his pieces continue to stand out from many ambient contemporaries hauschildt is also more confident than ever with his hardware: the almost entirely beatless record can be somber and deeply contemplative but never icy s tones are consistently rich and warm slathered in reverb and delay without overwhelming the details t almost 70 minutes may take a few unnecessary detours across its 14 tracks but its ultimately hauschildts most cohesive work here hes matched his well-established talents as a composer of cosmic ambient with a new depth of artistic direction
have always been consistent which made their two-year break from releasing all the more unusual now david kennett and jack stevens are back ahead of a second album for and guess what theyre still pretty darn reliable dialling back the crossover aspirations of delay no more s first single since 2013 does what theyve always done best: soulful vocal hooks and subtle instrumentation gently reined in by the drums is a banner track in that respect and its one of the most satisfying examples of their formula yet n the past the duo have run the risk of cribbing too closely from calibres piano-laden drum bass but here the ivories move a little out of step from the drums giving a less quantized feel and with a big fat bassline roaring in the distance its got some real muscle those driving basslines are the cornerstone of dont the continued push-and-pull between aggression and sunny pop is at the heart of what makes great and even if this two-year wait hasnt resulted in anything novel its still nice to hear kennett and stevens at their best
nick carter kevin swain combine with yuko to deliver a devastating anthem on the imprint felt love is the production and it must be said this is the kinda track that will make people get up and take notice on any dancefloor the original mix is simply devastating nice lively beats begin the production and not too long we hear glimpses of yuko s effected vocals make way for the very funky electro melodic patterns a very deep and ground shaking baseline soon enters and it is more then welcome as it takes the track up another level it almost has a somewhat retro eurythmics feel combined with a modern dancefloor appeal and the result is somewhat enticing on the flip is the shake dub and this is exactly what the doctor order a dub that is quite different to the original mix and fortunately just as bloody good fantastic electro baseline patterns combine with some nice quirky beats and the flow of the production is simply irresistible very dancefloor friendly and that s just the way we like it especially when the beautiful string laden breakdown enters there is plenty of good music going around these days and this release is just one of them two very good productions in one release is what is on offer here so don t be greedy and check this out
s matt welch and terry ryan have been producing tunes since the mid 90s and during that time have put together some of the finest tunes ever released on botchit scaper such as servin it up clubshaker and btp 2 and also remixes for artists like aquasky and rockers the egg sees the release of their debut album - a culmination of tunes embracing sounds of rock hip hop house techno and electro all rooted in the production principles of breakbeat they begin the proceedings of their breaks album with a rock song no you didnt just misread that - seven 10 split is a rock influenced breaks song kicking open with a guitar lick double time drum beats (reminiscent of psych rock tunes from the late 60s/early 70s) and middle eastern influenced hooks the beats and rhythms truly get intense during the chorus while vocalist justine berry takes things back to the carefree sounds of acid induced rock head is a hands in the air rock influenced trip featuring a gritty buzzsaw bassline tough breakbeat and vocals by pavinda who instructs the crowd to move with shouts of heads nodding feet just bouncing bodies moving crazy baby shine a light takes a trip through acid house loaded with a massive 303 intro and bubbly electro bassline with feel good gospel vocals courtesy of sweet hustler spitball leans towards jazzy percussive house with justine berry making a return with her feline-like moloko style vocals dreaming sees the duo cross the boundaries between 80s electro and breakbeat with a b-boy style beat arthur baker-esque synth riff and a booming bassline even features a slow moment on the album with the ballad-like twelve hundred miles in contrast to this is the rave influenced just one more with that unmissable jds style rave hook (similar in many ways to their classic tune nine ways especially prominent during the middle breakdown) techy stabs and rocking beats finally vocalist sweet hustler returns for the finale - the albums title tune which is a feel good rock number with spoken word bluesy harmonica with a classic rock feel is more than just a bunch of dancefloor oriented tunes it is a melting pot different music styles written as proper songs all deeply rooted in breakbeat have set a new standard in breakbeat albums and really set the bar up high
london-based frenchman xavier thomas earlier work showed a restless and adventurous protagonist creating everything from unstable melting synth-funk to choppy hip-hop jams as time has passed his sound has been solidifying into something with more power behind its rhythmic muscle focused and full-bodied he completes that transformation with his first album for a collection where his eclectic mix of exotic funk and wriggly synth lines finally congeals into a congruent mass easily his most satisfying and accomplished work yet exudes a certain confidence from its very first track: ori strikes with surety and swagger wide-set guitar riffs and gravelly screams lashing out like some determined rock band ts all stitched together so well you can only really tell its sampled music from its exaggerated jerky motions album flits through s usual number of genre touchstones a scribbled funk that occasionally resembles hip-hop but more often than not just assumes whatever shapes it can make from the odd edges leftover from thomas artisan craft vocals are a bigger part of his music than ever before sometimes distracting ( ) and other times the focal point as on album highlight where guitars duel underneath a vocodered chorus that brings to mind the unbridled joy of highlife and african acts like amadou mariam n fact so much of horizon dips its fingers into the essence of highlife it could almost be considered exploitative although what thomas appropriates is more the musics infectious effervescence than its actual sounds is a record that hones in almost exclusively on fun it just so happens that if you dig deeper youll be rewarded with a rich world of digital tapestry
everyone says that minimal is over my god trends burn out quickly don t they ut you sense that the folks at records will carry on regardless of what shoreditch thinks like they ve been doing 1997 the sixtieth release on the german label is from made up of canadian runo pronsato [underline orac] and long time patriot sammy dee from the weird but loveable pantytec like all tracks both and of strip down techno to its core elements this time leaving aside pronsato s signature samples and messy spasms (check magda s she s a dancing machine for four exhibits) to make space for intensity space in the bass and drums and a slightly unfinished feel will cause the most dancefloor impact here but like ricardo villalobos s chromosoul or melchior and luciano s father both sides of this 12 are proof that when you take obvious stabs build ups and headache-inducing anthemic synths out of club music you are sometimes left with a clarity that gives dancers much more room to move (and to think) on the floor
in the rigidly structured world of electronic music theres something wonderfully attractive about the idea of a live jam recently examples include the new roll the dice ep or perhaps more pertinently morphosis and his debut album to be honest im not sure whether s most recent release actually falls into this category but if it doesnt theyre doing a good impersonation t 14 minutes long seems like the logical result of a studio session getting out of hand thats not to say it feels excessive though like ralph lawsons 2020 soundsystem project the norse duos organic grooves are rather refreshing with definite dancefloor appeal thick bass and a scuttling insectoid arp drive things forward its not exactly summery but an easy hook and expansive programming make it an outdoor certainty -side retains this open-air vibe somewhat subtle bass drops hasten the proceedings and a funky 303 barely leaves for the entire duration its burbling tones prove a surprisingly good canvas for a plink-plonking piano and moroder-style synths live or not this is good stuff
warmth and sunshine have been a defining feature of many releases on tim sweeneys eats in space label and london producer s first release for the imprint is no different in particular has the spirit of summer running through it simple and pretty four-part brew of blissed-out pads soft-focus beats a hazy vocal loop and a gently emerging acid line itll sound just right at festival boat parties a few months from now has a more precise and focused feel the dreamy pads are still there but theyre joined this time by warehouse-ready hats and high-pitched drum shards it doesnt mesmerise in quite the same way as its predecessor but it balances its elements well to produce a less immediately obvious kind of appeal
last year alexander bergs solo project overshadowed his work in the duo genius of time the latter which berg formed with high-school buddy nils krogh were hot property on the club and festival circuit for a while thanks to a string of punchy summery jams and an easy-to-love live show genius of time still toured solidly last year but they havent released anything since summer 2014 on the other hand has put out six records in the past two years seven if you include his latest offering on john talabots whether is an album or a double-ep its the swedes largest and most high-profile release yet the result of a strong friendship and musical bond with talabot its also his boldest artistic statement if it was ever unclear whether had his own style is resounding proof that no one sounds like him the record is set apart by its rich atmospheres vivid sonic landscapes depicted using a distinct and kaleidoscopic palette of synths its a style built from the trippy melodic foundations of his early aniara releases berg has grown into in recent years only now realised in full hd clarity like any of bergs work since 2014s splade ep on northern electronics an otherworldly feel colours it makes for a rewarding cover-to-cover listen even when the music varies wildly in mood swinging suddenly from springtime exuberance ( ) to overcast gloom ( ) theres an ethereal fug that permeates throughout giving the record a compelling cohesiveness berg achieves this by emphasizing texture and sound design as he told me last year he likes to visualize his tracks as faraway vistas which helps shape his sounds to complement the feeling hes after pick any cut from at random and youll hear the process in action note the interplay between the muted foghorn and the shrill siren on : though they differ significantly in timbre and pitch a distant melancholic quality draws them tighter and tighter together by the end its impossible to separate one from the other but an immersive record isnt necessarily a complete record a whole side of is missing here a side that some would argue represents his best work as well as trancey electronics and transcendental soundscapes berg is a master of groove his kick-and-bassline combos transform cuts like 2013s smuts or 2014s devotion into killer club weapons the tone across is more delicate and lush with melodies rather than rhythms forming the major moments and are the standouts in that way both with the sort of gauzy earworms built his name on the latter is particularly intoxicating sending shimmers of bright light billowing on a strong breeze is the swedish word for will-o-the-wisp a term used to describe an atmospheric ghost light seen by travellers at night especially over bogs swamps or marshes its a strong clue to the vibe berg was after he wanted to make a record that put the listening experience first and club functionality second channeling his passion for thick eerie atmospherics it was an ambitious undertaking which for the most part he pulls off strikingly even if fans might wish there was more of the old mixed in with the new
stefan kozalla makes house music so cannily programmed strange and raw that techno kids want him for their own ut kozalla isnt letting go no matter how many samples he draws out like taffy or extended synth modulations he slides through fat fucked-up beats he stands rooted in the raw eccentric fundament of house its a place where everything bounces off of everything else and theres no space between you your sweat and the music rich earthy drums pound for two solid minutes at the start of then undergo a series of hallucinations as real as anything youll see on a three-day fast only to re-emerge as ultra-clipped dots and dashes slowly pounding out code for the first transplanetary railroad is just as good or maybe its better demonic downtuned muppets nattering about deep house mate with princes ob george on the vocal inducing you to jack while oddly looming incidental percussion and a heavy rippling undercurrent of bass kicks force you to obey bsolutely first-rate
just ahead of his next full length on echocord greek dub techno producer fluxion here manages to steal the limelight with his remix of one of two originals provided by italian dubster on the third volume of his ep series lets go immediately back to that remix: at first its all nervy twitchy post-apocalyptic static and implied malevolence but almost spontaneously turns into a hunched over dubbed out (naturally) and efficiently rolling groove of the sort you could listen to forever the key is the contrast between the woody hits and electric glitches and the thick pillow-y bed of melted sonics which keep them in suspension its a nice effect that keeps you peering deep into its murky midst as a result the original version is a more straightforward asic channel-indebted dub techno cut (is there any other sort ) that spreads out far and wide sweeping up everything in its path and continuing to churn like the unstoppable ocean currents of the atlantic on the other hand features a more complex and unpredictable bed of beats that jimmy and shimmy at will keeping you guessing till the end: like kontexts frazzled dub palette s charm is in detail
stuart li has kept a fairly recognisable sound throughout his 12-year career its not unique to him but he does it as well as anyone consummate long- and short-form releases on labels like dolly nonplus and still music all prove that much: be they deeper house dub or techno excursions everything li does leans on heavyweight funk lo-fi grit and an uncomplicated yet absorbing sense of function for his next trick the canadian producer known as further homes in on these aesthetics eschewing deep house and dub to serve up an unadulterated collection of ten forceful techno weapons comparisons to artists like shed are obvious youll hear it in the way the drums pound and rumble the way the sharp percussion glints just enough to stand out from the subterranean murk and the way retro rave stabs act as subtle hooks li has essentially turned in ten variations on a berlin techno theme but is compelling nonetheless has drum programming so punchy no one could fault it is so cavernous its sure to fill vast warehouses and thought is smeared with synths and flashed with melody in a way that recalls prime-era carl craig while the tempo rarely shifts throughout lis second album the mood does he can do sombre finality (as per the title track) brutal over-compressed physicality ( ) and nerve twitching high-pressure urgency ( ) with equal skill result is an album that leaves little room for boredom might not be the most original or ambitious album you will hear this year but its arresting it moves quickly and it never looks back
since he arrived on the scene in 00 has become such a big name in german dance music that we ve come to somewhat take him for granted we all think we know what records sound like and basically we think they sound like von rolling along like a steam locomotive occasionally collapsing in an epileptic fit of percussive nonsense and pausing once or twice to gaze up at the stars accompanied by heavenly swoopy noises and that s not a bad thing to sound like actually however it s not entirely accurate as a collection of mostly previously released tracks this album serves as a good retrospective on eulberg s career to date and it s amazing how varied it is is here of course but so are a great many other tracks with a rather different sound for example has brassy haunting melodies in melancholic counterpoint to one another and weird crepuscular sounds that are half rhythm and half melody it sounds like dark green densely populated undergrowth illuminated by moonlight it s glorious and i can t believe it was never a bigger tune (with the exception of its inclusion on tiefschwarz s misch masch ) it sounds nothing like the eulberg stereotype of chaotic unexpected noises followed by swooning breakdowns but once you hear it you know it had to be made by him the melodies on bjorn borkenkafer and alpenstrandlaufer von captivate and send the mind soaring over distant tracts of brooding nordic conifers whereas the stop-start rhythms and interrupted bleeping of im feels more extraterrestrial and disturbing in many ways the least impressive tracks on the album are the harder more driving recent releases - zum bass and these feel appropriate to today s dancefloors but lack the depth and trippiness of the earlier tracks course the other thing we all know about herr eulberg is that he s a nature enthusiast and plays up the park ranger aesthetic to the hilt on the front cover dominik mugs to the camera in front of a mixing desk in the middle of a forest while each track is prefaced by animal noises and what sounds like a lecture in german about a chosen animal but marketing ploy as it may be and critical clich as it certainly is the pastoral sound that eulberg has captured is nothing less than impressive it s extremely rare to achieve a new aesthetic in techno but achieve it he has the dense detail and fractal sensibility of these tracks with their combination of regularity and randomness really does feel the way that nature feels
from the strange waters of nyc comes another precocious unknown: brooklyn producer chris leung makes barreling techno that shares a cartoonish violence with blawan and a dark sense of poppy hedonism with turbos output its not terribly original but your face will likely be too busy melting for that to matter is of a piece with a very common kind of techno these days with its out-of-time drums and dramatically reverbed woodblocks but theres also something strangely exhilarating about it because kind of feels like the bus from speed : if it ever stops its just going to fall apart (or blow up i guess) so by the time it reaches its midsection its a black hole of cowbells and woodblocks billowing out every which way dont think cowbells could sound apocalyptic think again the track is already a monster at 135 bpm but randomer ups it to a mind-numbing 150 for his remix feels like by-the-numbers techno until an amen break signals a descent into a hellish squall if youre not pummeled into oblivion by the first two tracks offers respite when it reveals a sexy skip instead of brutish barbarism but even this one is overtaken by a bassline that turns itself inside out amid an acid bath of handclaps
suzanne kraft (real name diego herrera) and jonny nash seem at home in amsterdam pair share a studio in the citys red light district in a complex that houses red light radio redlight records and music from memory yve struck up a close bond in part because theyre likeminded souls with a focus on making supremely chilled music and in nashs label theyve got the perfect outlet for their meandering sound everything on the label to date has either been a jonny nash record a suzanne kraft record or a split release with music from those artists however is their first collaborative record album was recorded not in amsterdam but near the m56 motorway in cheshire in the uk it contains particular hallmarks of each artists sound res the gently billowing synths and comforting low frequencies that have been central to herreras recent ambient work nashs trademark guitar can be heard on the final track while the plucked tones of hint at the eastern-influenced percussion that was so central to his recent solo album eden its general spaciousness also puts it on a similar footing to another one of nashs collaborative projects gaussian curve chords that herald the start of for example would fit snugly onto distance but this album is not merely a layer cake of sounds weve heard before from nash and herrera was made mostly with software-based instruments a change from the duos preferred hardware method piano flourishes like on opening song are more detailed and nuanced than anything theyve released in the past some tracks like and slip by at barely a whisper the spaces between sounds more pronounced than ever s assuredness shows two artists who are clearly on the same wavelength
globalization: on the one hand it can put a starbucks on every corner of the globe on the other it allows your ears to feast on records like s debut records which wouldnt have been possible to make in a pre-digital pre-internet era much less globally distribute fitting then that its also the launch release for a new label from uruguay called because thats exactly what this 12-inch stocked with a multi-culti cadre of remixes gives off of has trappings of a great underdog story two students from the town of wander into a a r office with a demo of an attention-grabbing piano-house track they play on a couple of iphones the guy behind the desk gets inspired to start a label and corrals harvey bassett into a remix who doesnt love it when nobodies become somebodies especially as in s case they deserve it s debut is dominated by glistening multi-octave piano playing that tumbles across the scales like a waterfall of is right it sounds like the ivories are getting quite the amorous caress arent afraid to pile the tracks chugging space-boogie with extra keyboard layers that build in a long crescendo of rising heartfelt drama without ever drowning in excess with its rich variety of elements those glistening runs those heart-swollen chords the piano playing offers up a wide berth of possibility for the remixer each version offered here finds its own way to snatch a bit of the keys and make them new reworks by mugwump and reverso both solidly update the low-end while keeping the overall vibe intact gatto s remix is almost unfathomably deep slathered with waves of echo distant guttural screams and exploding synthesizer fury it plumbs the psychedelic depths so far its basically the drug submarine of remixes its called a version and when it ends you feel like youve been pleasantly terrorized by something you havent fully understood its less of a track and more of a condensed assault from the fx-return channels then you got yourself dj harvey bassetts apparently become chums enough with the folks behind to sign on for three releases its no small coup for a brand new label as harvey hasnt released almost anything for over ten years under his own name harvey cans the piano altogether preferring to take some rippling analog pulses and blow them up to widescreen size add some loping live drums and slow everything to a heart-beating head-nodding steamrollers pace what else did you want him to do if youre a beard-carrying disco fan it only makes the prospect of those three forthcoming releases all the more mouth-watering

for anyone who thinks is immune to the whimsical ends of cold synthetic dance music is here to prove otherwise well dmx krews space cucumbers already gave the sheffield label a dose of playful vintage beats but ristolian tom parkers solo debut takes that sound further into the realm of kitschy synth pop two hardware obsessives actually seem to have a lot in common as the deep crooning and classic electro bounce of bring to mind pop-inspired records like we re dmx its a kind of tongue-in-cheek homage that wont be to everyones taste but with enough spins parkers full-bodied grooves and simple hooks could win over the most serious electro fan on the -side doubles down on the 80s references and chintzy samples digital slap bass police sirens neon synth leads and old string stabs border on ridiculous despite how well parker makes them work together it seems more like a little curio for fans of this era and sound than something youd actually hear on a dance floor but thats fine for a record like
baby ford and zip are two key figures in a sound thats past its heyday but for which many of us still have a flame: minimal house the former made some of the styles best records whether on his own or with thomas melchior as ul capsule the duo behind anthems like law of grace and lady science (nyc sunrise) zip of course is half the brains behind perlon (alongside markus nikolai) one of the most iconic underground labels of the 00s home to era-defining records by everyone from mathew jonson to ricardo villalobos every few years the two artists put out a record together (a rare occurrence for zip) their latest on baby fords label is an unflattering example of the sound they helped create is a subtle afterhours track with an undulating groove and drums that feel like theyve been carved out of marble essentially what these two do best and its two alternate versions the melchior edit and the apella feel less inspired the beats lack momentum and are complemented by a tired ensemble of the surreal little flourishes that seem to follow zip everywhere: distant groans hints of studio ambience and druggy moaned half-words (the vocal part on goes something like -eeeaah ) you could say that it sounds dated but that would be beside the point lots of records on and perlon sound their age but i still love them this one is just a bit too dreary
ts a comparison that are probably sick of but theres no way of around it: they sound quite like the knife ts not just the way that in certain breathless moments tiffany prestons voice sounds similar to karin dreijer anderssons they also share a fondness for big hollowed-out synth sounds f m the la duos second proper album is precisely the kind of odd engagingly raw synth pop that the knife were trading in prior to silent shout that might sound like damning with feint praise far from it n the knifes evolution into something more serious they lost a lot of what still have in spades: innocent charm vulnerability a winningly lo-fi art-pop sensibility there are moments when f m flirts with the clich s of 80s major label synth-pop: declarative piano lines synths mimicking guitar solos saxophones airbrushed keys that come perilously close to sounding like pan pipes and so on unlike a band like hurts however get away with it because there isnt a bombastic bone in their bodies their aesthetic is more ze than em not that are alone in those qualities there are plenty of cute but ineffectual synth acts operating in similar territory what sets them apart is their songcraft and their gift for arrangement t is exquisite they always had hooks but where the appeal of their debut boys and diamonds lay mainly in its world music rhythms and melodies is straighter painstaking in its own low-budget way and bathed as it is in a potent fug of despairing melancholy far more emotionally resonant the way key tracks ( sorcerer the beautiful chromatics-like ) unfold with such easy irrefutable logic is the mark of a band in the zone
the first cut on phil shers second phillerz record tests just how much the 303 can writhe the answer as you probably know is quite a lot undergirded by thumping drums and demonic snatches of vocal the brits acid line doesnt so much hit notes as it frantically squirms ts a similar kind of thing to bintus recent dvanced fuel but its missing the varied percussion to enliven it fares better in this respect but then it is a drum track built with robotic-sounding toms and horn-like vocals it creates a tidy rhythm which djs will find useful ll steps away from the windy city instead taking its cues from the west coast setting up a slightly jacking beat sher splices in long trailing vocals and metronomic chime work s with the other two tracks it would appear to validate the phillerz title theyll be played but probably not remembered the next morning
its funny how music can take on a mythical status by virtue of its scarcity not that doesnt deserve the attention originally released in 2000 on the short lived nurture label it was the only record to come from leyton glens son sine alias (two self released demos arrived ten years later) finally receiving a reissue courtesy of is one of those magical eps that sounds every bit as relevant a decade later thats primarily because theres nothing fashionable about it s with the best smallville material the ep has a timeless and slightly classicist quality rooted in the dubbier end of techno has the crackly ambiance of a farben tune but its sonorous bass notes and pointed synths make more use of the midrange melodic elements drift like glaciers in a backdrop marked by tasteful piano work the whole thing unfolds more like ambient than techno karuna glides with a basic channel inspired patience methodically dropping its decayed chords over a silty drum beat returning to the panoramic perspective of the side mudita feels both huge and withdrawn contrasting its minimalist rhythm with yawning melodies like standing over a vast rolling landscape has the unique quality of something grand in scale that feels intimate at the same time
say what you want about s debut album and most of you already did ; its easy to see that it was anything but a dance floor record for this remix 12-inch ropes in producers to mould two of albums songs into shapes more suited to pulling shapes labelmate dave s remix is predictable and maybe a little too easy but its infectiously hooky throb is too much to resist straightens out turning jaars original self-serious vocal into a hypnotic mantra and beefing up originals blob of a bassline into chugging an mia the selling point of ep however is two ever-rarer appearances from french house maestro pepe radock whose contributions are about as out- re as youd expect radocks mix of in emphasizes and underlines ra r than deconstructs his hands track becomes druggy space-rock dirge it mightve been its shimmering guitar tones slowed down to syrupy smears and its bassline a motorik spore cloud of low-frequencies theres not a kick drum to be found radocks fantome poke mix of track is more typically percussive but its amphetamine-addled hi-hat frenzy of techno ra r than radocks smoo r house flavours the originals muddled elements mingle messily underneath however and it never quite coheres
part of what makes south gqom unique is its monotony literally many gqom tracks feature just one pitched note rumbling along beneath graceful syncopated percussion the athens label in the press release for calls the aesthetic drumndrone the records creators the durban crew audioboyz have previously downplayed the second half of the formula last years danger on blank mind was all about scalpel-sharp drums and fleeting melody the rise of goes the other way synth strings pads choir oohs and trance-preset leads are all pressed into the service of that single droning pitch on these elements mount and mount slowly throttling the drums until the feeling of ominous tension is almost unbearable and drifting away throw in trademark gqom vocal shouts the former is distinguished by its particularly thunderous tom fills the latter by brash lead lines which even venture a little three-note riff but they share s tense feeling a suspense expressed in the language of hollywood scores a very modern kind of dread trapped in amber and sculpted for the dance floor is the standout because it ever so slightly twists this mood the chords drifting across its mid-range suggest not angst but melancholy its just the thing to set off the eps monochrome gleam
is best known for its releases by composers like nils frahm ol fur arnalds and michael price who blur the lines between classical and pop as well as bona fide classical musicians such as lubomyr melynk but its also been putting out a steady stream of electronic releases since its inception six years ago most of them by ryan lee west both under the alias and as one half of the techno duo kiasmos with ol fur arnalds in line with the labels aesthetic music is melodic and textural rather than beat-focused rich glassy synths bubble on a nice foil to the gritty pads while a crackling sheen coats the languid beats of the title track on the ep highlight west draws together fragments of string noise plucked chords and faint chattering into a surprisingly dramatic piece with plump low-end that saves it from being too polite that same cinematic feel is central to the plaid-indebted where synths swarm over a jaunty loop and simple drum pattern the closing track would work beautifully as an instrumental but the call-and-response double-tracked vocals of are an unnecessary ornament to wests glitchy electronics
is the pseudonym of a pair of german men motec and daniel gelbe and bribe em with candy is a good alluring ep that offers some of the luxuriant languidness that was the secret weapon of early 00s minimalism in short this could have been on force inc once upon a time and yes thats a compliment take the lead track babe in which the rhodes strings rise up soooo gradually its like an endless tease thats a timeless trick while the techy production edges give it that more specific resonance ( dub is an appropriately gauzy revisit ) samples an english (i think) preacher whos less fire-and-brimstone than up-and-at-em over coolly skittering hats and a restrained 303 (another one ) thats appropriate the congas and slurry percussion of have the twin effects of night lights on one side and ocean on the other evoking everything from balearic to mr fingers to the last nebraska ep but its uniquely spare and cool
brazils s p y is a rising star in the drum bass world having released floor stompers on labels like soul:r 31 and metalheadz in the past year alone but while hes had plenty big tracks thats also meant that he has spread himself thin hes appeared on no less than ten releases in by this reviewers count his newest release on critical music suffers as a result the record featuring two well-crafted dark rollers in the neur unk vein that grab you by the throat while they play but are sadly are too easily forgotten afterwards is a classic misnomer as a brooding sense danger and darkness is built from the f with cinematic string samples and a raspy high-pitched lead synth there isnt much joy to be found in this sonic landscape hip hop-esque vocal leads the track to a drop and from then on its a tumble through dark terrain with hard-hitting beats and distorted basslines leading the way stormtrooper is set f by eerie atmospherics and skittering hi-hats that give way to a central bass motif before a big drop with a tick-tock 2-step beat emerges the simple but effective bass riff is the heart around which s p y weaves strings vocals and effects situating the track firmly in neur unk territory its the stronger the two tracks here but still doesnt contain the sort standout moment that separates it from similar fare
and scuba are polarising figures: both have ascended from the underground to the big leagues and success has brought a backlash a glut of narcotic house made damian lazaruss label ras favourite in 2011 only to be ubiquitously ripped off with diminishing returns for paul rose it was the move from forward-thinking dubstep towards main-room techno which alienated those who liked swampy textures and early-hours brooding roses remix of a collaboration between seattle techno don pezzner and the j rk-like amina is masterful its a nine-minute trek through star-bright synths that build and then collapse into crushing drum grooves and though it wont win back anyone pining for triangulation it should thunder out of his laser-drenched live show come festival season side-by-side with the remix the original falls a touch flat the versions arent hugely different but theres a thickness to roses take thats missing from pezzners the remix is a synth orgy but the original is all about aminas breathy vocal a sing-speak that imbues the stabs and toms with an ethereal oddness elevating something that would otherwise be overly functional that leaves us with the rippling house groove of an odd track that spends three minutes doing nothing then brings in an infectious bassline that almost immediately leads into a fade-out

its hard to know what to make of his twitter is a carefully cultivated stew of sarcasm and oddness the pr accompanying this release says he was once a lovely trusting lad but is now consumed by anger yet in a recent interview the man himself said he was actually happier than he has ever been there are few clues in his music which has so far ranged from downbeat and anaemic to vocal tripped out and hip-hoppy this debut on lukids similarly oddball glum shifts the goal posts once again it finds the scot turning his attention to a more fulsome and ravey sound but one that unsurprisingly is as idiosyncratic and imperfect as ever opening with the vibe is doleful from the off but it doesnt lack purpose: lingering bassline plunders at its own pace as lively well-defined drums and snares pat out a half-tropical rhythm soaring strings poke through during the drum-less sections and the whole thing feels like its slowly limbering up to action on a lazy sunday morning the title track on the other hand hasnt been to bed: its a tight splintered and lo-fi techno rampage that surges along a on a 90 mph hi-hat line for five frenzied minutes sounds like a glassy and glistening echolations -era lone cut for its ping-ponging melodies and refracted rave euphoria before the simultaneously harsh yet heartfelt sounding drops back down to the lethargic and predatory tempos has oft favoured in the past jagged compressed and slapping claps are offset by a smooth undulating bassline and the whole thing is drenched in an atmospheric tape hiss whatever the mindset of the man behind the music the dishevelled sounds he continues to put forth never fail to beguile
youd think function and vatican shadow two artists inclined toward big sounds might adopt even heftier musical modes when they get together in the studio their recent collaborative lp certainly merges their signature approaches to techno: david sumners penchant for widescreen sound design dominick fernows streamlined and devilishly effective compositional style in practice though theyve pulled each other rather than pushed their ambient suite is an unexpected exercise in restraint both sumner and fernow have long worked a kind of meditative quality into their music though we tend to get there by being overwhelmed with sound stripped (for the most part) of kick drums and standard techno tempos the producers pluck us from the crosshairs of speaker stacks and let us stare down at the chaos from above what might have been synth stabs on a function 12-inch get smeared into throbbing pads; vatican shadows noisy blasts soften to a distant pulse with only the occasional crinkle of tape hiss rising into the mix that doesnt mean were kept entirely out of the fray sequenced to perfection opens the valves and lets in a little more tension at each stage and the albums warm center introduce the first hi-hat each hit a little more reverb-laden than the last it pushes hopeful chords into more ominous melodic territory dark turn seems to have a knock-on effect: after the nauseous slow-motion holding pattern of sumner and fernow finally let their techno impulses out of the cage on lush with twinkling highs throbbing lows and bits of acid bass filtered into paper-thin sheets its the impeccably tweaked wall of sound id expected to hear when word of the producers collaboration first filtered out is the albums most obviously impressive track but im glad sumner and fernow took their time getting there is a sumptuous subtle pleasure letting each producer showcase subtler sides of his musical personality without giving listeners anything less than their best work

trevor s description of metal dance as perhaps darker in places than its predecessor is a curious one if metal dance was anything it was dour a grey jagged vista of disconsolate dub and aggressive post punk punctuated by muscular ebm tracks which in his r review william rauscher described as berghain fuck room nightmares on this second instalment the wider context is bleak once again this is still very much the 80s of cold war alienation and political anger but even when metal dance is sonically harder than its predecessor which it frequently is it is nonetheless subtly but significantly lighter in tone even the most forbidding passages of metal dance are shot through with an eccentric playfully subversive quality that on the first compilation didnt extend much beyond album opener bubblemen re coming for all its steel mill percussion and for all the industrial heritage of the acts involved we get a slice of something unexpectedly camp and catchy from an atypical overture to the dance floor from and atmospheric proto dub techno from se are interspersed with the s shrill art punk and in s brilliantly ridiculous a fantasy in which the credible hulk saves us from police brutality if there is a historical observation to be gleaned from metal dance it is how in the 80s the divide between the mass media pop music and the arty underground was remarkably porous such periods of fluid exchange come in unpredictable waves but as the presence here of p 40 acts like and illustrates many artists in the 80s who made difficult music didnt disdain popular success without compromising their art they were simultaneously poised on the brink of crossover chart exposure one tiny weakness to metal dance it is that this territory the overlap between art pop and early electronic dance music was examined in detail on electroclash era compilations from gomma soul jazz nuphonic et al refore it doesnt feel quite as distinct as the more tightly ebm and dub focused metal dance but its a testament to s taste and knowledge that the tracks hes chosen werent over exposed on those earlier compilations with metal dance he has unearthed another treasure trove of misshapen ugly gems which for all their dated syndrums and affected vocals speak down the ages

is a collaborative project between germanys lars hemmerling and russian ex-pat dasha rush on rushs records imprint is the projects first official release and it should find favor among previous fans as well as listeners craving a fresh approach to raw industrialized techno the records eponymous track starts things off with a dimly-lit collection of sparse bleeps indecipherable radio transmissions and a swooning choral moan as gorgeous as it is timid ultimately though the track is nearly overcome by indulgence as echoes pile up and the drums let loose in a series of pummeling offbeat riffs next up is the beat-less a melancholy spread of soft glitchy loops and synths some may consider its four-minute length more than enough for a techno vinyl but others (such as this writer and perhaps the doomed lovers from the records artwork) will wish that it stuck around for a little while longer after the fleeting romance of the flip takes us back into the darkness with the most focused and floor-ready production on the record due to a sharp syncopated kick pattern and discrete use of effects revolving around a shivering mass of sound and an increasingly frantic high-end its a strong conclusion to a fine debut for
dutchman c o n e is part of a wave of rotterdam artists making what he calls brukstep their particular brand of grime their sound is heavily influenced by early 00s london broken beat music but its slinkier sexier and less claustrophobic imagine a mongrel breed of uk funky and bassline with the severity of wiley and youre on the right track his first ep for the seminal broken beat label loungin is a remarkably assured record that feels current even as it plays with tropes from the past is a strong opening statement like something you might hear on marcus nastys rinse show the exaggerated bounce screams uk funky but the monotone bassline is confrontational like grime throw in its metal-on-metal chord refrain and its somewhere between hessle audio envelope-pushing and night slugs functionalism isnt doing anything to quell comparisons with the latter bright neon synths are laid over beats that feel as if theyre trying to knock the wind out of you with an elaborate series of punches the eps other side reveals the softer side of brukstep has a more leisurely swing to it and its lukewarm liquid chords lend it a friendlier feel than its counterparts is even more intriguing: appropriating the slippery flow of dub techno the broken beat structure gains a grandiosity that the form rarely reaches

being subtle its true and on represent the first bow from the san fran producer from his upcoming album and theyre like little youve heard from him before which closed out vonstrokes excellent fabric mix is the prototypical album closer it takes its main melodic meat from a twinkling digital synth line with enough gloomy fake strings to satisfy the depressive in your family before building up to the classic vonstroke bump except it bumps and backs off and builds again declining to take you by the shirt collar and throw you down on the ground ala most of his previous work under the cvs name on is possibly even more mannered using thunder and a quick-footed off-beat to wring every bit of drama out of the track he can its a slow build taking about four minutes to get to the descending synth climax but it helps to cement the idea that this track is a reference to his drum bass past a genre full of extended intros and outros that sometimes were far more interesting than the actual tracks themselves (that vonstroke lets the song play for a minute past its end with only the noise of rain and nature is no accident ) its hard to imagine that the eventual full-length will have anything else like these two but bodes well for its versatility cvs seems to understand that rewriting whos fraid of detroit wont make him too many new fans and for that we can all be thankful

heidelberg don rounds off s 50th release with etroit a fitting symbol of the labels libran balance between j relevance and cerebral stimulation stretched out over eleven minutes its minimalistic 909 rhythm makes imperceptible shifts from skittering and watertight towards brittle and fractured accompanied by tremulous chords that hover in mid air and ever increasing arcs of reverb preceding six numbers are an even split between serviceable tracks that thrive within floor focused conservatism and oddball jams that excel despite it keen ears will be familiar with the thundering filtered piano chords wiry strings and swollen disco bass of s the pick of this eps litter amongst house js but on closer inspection its lacking the precocious elegance that distinguished his first three eps ike flips that scenario abandoning the boisterous frankenstein edits of his lost 4 trax ep for throw back music 94 a subdued arrangement that settles for familiar house tropes of bongos and a vaguely retro back and forth melody s finds more inspiration within the formula replacing bongos with scuffed edges sandpaper claps funk guitar licks and a melody that spirals upwards marks the beginning of the 4/4 molestation adopting the slow house tempo du jour but turning it into a balmy daydream of unintelligible vocals strummed accompaniments and a double stepping beat that is as light as honeycomb mysterious newcomer is just as quirky but not so amiable happy to change the setting to unease and leave it there arrives on the swell of a gothic choral waltz accompanied by wailing cellos and a saturated 6/8 rhythm giving way briefly to a surprise interlude of sleazy soundtrack funk before flicking back into its baroque mood resident beat freaks settle somewhere between the previous two segmenting their signature future retro sound collage with a prominent harpsichord and piecing it together again with webbing of analog pads absence of soulphiction/jackmate is a conspicuous omission but in allowing his artists to dictate the breadth of s sound michel baumann demonstrates how his label has remained vital after more than a decade

ddison groove has said that he created footcrab as a way of providing a transition from dubstep in juke and footwork in his dj sets and s feels like it has been designed with a similar intention in mind this time though approach chicagos breakneck style is routed through drum bass is really two tracks in one the first minute and a half channels late 90s techstep vibes with a rolling satisfyingly woody break set against ominous strings and bell nes ut after a beatless stretch of growling foghorn bass tune abruptly shifts in a snapping shuffling pattern modeled after footworks rapid fire shakers and snare tat os it doesnt really sound like footwork proper; serrated bass riffs and high def menace could only come from drum bass with its half speed swagger and triple time detailing 808 rimshots hi hats and cowbells flying like splinters its definitely not drum bass as were used it ei r it sounds amazing: the handclap alone deserves some kind of award est of all is way tune keeps ducking and feinting pausing in its hectic headlong tumble luxuriate in a pitch shifted breakbeat or dropping out beat revel in a particularly gnarly bass modulation its a dazzling display of rhythmic prowess
more than a decade after dubstep reached the city and more than two since trip-hop its still hard to keep up with the sheer volume of interesting dance music coming out of ristol the style of the moment is post-livity techno though the mood solemn dubwise is eternal debuting on a new label from the citys tape-echo crew gives it a fresh twist his rhythms are subtly unusual his atmospheres arctic is the more striking of the two tracks the best thing about it is the groove a broken-beat lope bound up with barbed-wire hi-end what little melody there is drifts past in a thin fog punctuated by distorted blasts of what might be a voice is equally sparse its rustling shakers and crisp sidesticks combined with blasts of synth horn suggest grime only its grime pitched way down and emptied of bravado leaving little more than echoes and paranoia
as the first follow-up to an album with the clout of drone logic s new two-tracker is conspicuously understated both and are techno cuts of a linear patient nature and find the londoner largely using that space to explore textures and rhythmic subtleties its all far from the acidic snarls and rich melodies that made averys debut lp such engrossing dance music which despite nuanced sound design and meaty arrangements is a gap not fully compensated for on either track with its rumble of a beat trippy synth squiggle and varied pads is the most engaging of the two the barren expanse of has its own charms: avery lets a few percussive elements and two ominous swelling chords fill the void with long trails of reverb forging weighty paranoia around the drum machines simplistic bounce pay close enough attention and youll get sucked into the details but is still the mood piece to s deep hypnosis both sides could handle their own in the plateaux of a marathon dj set or during an early morning second wind even if they dont stand out by themselves
in techno a little progression goes a long way even the loopiest of tunes going back to say basic channel use subtle shifts in composition and energy to keep the dance floor interested finding the balance between repetition and change is an ongoing quest for most producers not least those enlisted to remix tracks from s chronicles future album most of the five artists assembled take a hypnotic approach with their reworks so the differences lie in how much happens across each track abdulla supplies the most repetitive cut with his take on twisting it into a six-minute loop track based around a single synth note and a marching kick drum only shifts are a few mini-breakdowns and a smattering of technoid samples hisses licks of acid that swirl while the track chugs its more tool-like than its placement on the suggests other remixes are more dynamic but retain an ethereal touch silent s version of is also loopy but the subtle rise and fall of melody gives it a sense of forward movement same goes for efdemins burrowing remix of and priss rework of where percussive shifts inject energy without detracting from an otherwise psychedelic mood only function offers a big moment his remix of has strings and the eps heaviest kick drum
fachwerk is the german term for when the framework of a building is partially exposed think the wooden beams on the front of tudor houses the label of the same name is similarly interested in turning the underlying structure into the main attraction s hypnotic tracks scrutinise the building blocks of loopy techno he counterposes odd swing and grid-locked straightness and sets contrasting timbres in careful balance like the centuries-old fachwerk method the style has a bit of a heritage vibe these days this sort of machinic techno sounded more at home around the turn of 2010 but dehnert and co are still at it and his ep for clone basement demonstrates that the old approaches still work is the highlight sitting in the dry funky space that holds some of dehnerts best its fat downpitched voice woody kicks and shaker loops cling tightly together while controlled blasts of feedback go off in the background the whole thing somehow both sits back on the groove and strains against it the rest of sounds like the larger venues dehnert tends to dj in the title tracks angry rave stabs dont really go anywhere but the other two are more dramatic is dehnert at his least subtle with booming drums and obnoxious big-room synth snarls only a treacly voice in the background goes quietly against the flow on metallic chords whoosh unevenly against layers of rimshots scraping and paradiddling across one another the hi-hats jangle unsteadily at the top as if the whole structure could fall down at any moment we know dehnert well enough to be certain that it wont
side from a sunny biography here on r theres not much information to be found online about whoever he is the israeli artist has been taking a uniquely lush laid back approach to house music for only a few years while already producing more than a dozen eps primarily on the digital imprint t the very end of he put out s framework techno sketches ever an exceedingly pleasant collection of material pulled mostly from prior releases ever is bookended with vaguely unsettling soundscapes starting with the strained configuration of beats and vocal loops on but its the blissful warmth spread across the albums other tracks that grab the most attention simply boils over with endless melodic cascades while both its counterpart and 3 nobodyseverybody lazily reach into the ether with tendril like synths and strings to make sure we dont get completely lost in that haze offers an unexpectedly jazzy reprieve late in the album theres nothing on ever that will burn up a dance floor but while most of the material here is oriented around mellow percussive shuffles the album does have its tighter more urgent selections take the swinging groove of 0 for example that one thumps along under the command of a few shimmering vocal samples and its certainly a standout along with whose dubbed out glitches further reveal a keen eye for detail the journey ends with the foreboding vibe of helav but for me the albums best moment is the penultimate bout one of ever s newest and most uplifting tracks which softly erupts into a storm of swirling feedback laced drones it helps wind down a perfect hour long introduction to s hypnotic methods save this one for the early morning hours and prepare for the best sort of seduction
with s recent dj-kicks mix receiving plenty of praise for its varied tracklist it makes sense that k7 would choose a similarly varied group to remix danilo plessows exclusive production for the compilation kyle starts proceedings with a slow burner swells and distant vocals build tension while 16th note white noise hats chug along until the track climaxes with some signature kmfh synth jamming while plessow used soulful vocals to add emotion to the original track the vehemence in which s licks are played has a similar if not more powerful effect to call wolfgang s version a remix would be unfair to and smallpeople; he strips the original back to its basic groove and edits it from then onwards elements of the original are chopped up and effected to add s personal touch a panned bass here a piano stab there but think of this more as l o v e (dub mix) and it makes much more sense in the same vein to call smallpeoples version a remix would be unfair to mcde the majority of this effort is new content thats no bad thing: classic house piano chords skippy hats and that bassline all combine to make a stellar effort
the berlin based label run by brothers john and is known by few but revered by those who do churning out dj cuts steadily since 2010 its become one of underground house musics quintessential cult labels their records are the dust speckled glue holding together all sorts of dj sets i wouldnt pour myself a glass of wine and luxuriate on my sofa to either side of necessarily its sandpapery production and loopy approach to composition take it pretty far outside the home listening realm but they should have a unique and pleasurable effect in the club the john track lumbers along at first tripping over its own chunky beat chipper hi hats and a wildly upbeat disco vamp come in later and instantly transform it into an anthem that vamp builds things up again and again maybe more times than is necessary strictly speaking but its extended runtime and rollercoaster form should give djs plenty of flexibility on the flip s breakdowns are even bigger and stranger varies the 909 onslaught with whirling melodic sections and ecstatic female vocals oh honey youre making me feel good inside she says and as the oversized cymbals abruptly slap back in any dance floor worth its salt will feel the same
producers shine when their work channels a variety of influences the best results come when artists combine eras and sounds in a way that sounds fresh a focus on one classic style rarely yields anything as good as the real deal offenbach youngster has shown an impressive versatility across his expanding catalogue laying down deep house for imprints hazy electro for pager and with a new 10-inch for the seekers sub-label an on-point blend of house and 2-step with a classy electro flair on the surface might seem like the most straightforward track sommer has released it chugs at a brisk 130 bpm yet feels laid-back catchy synth keys are the tracks focal point echoed by a melodic bass pattern its a simple but effective trick that gives something to grab onto as drum fills and all kinds of zips and zaps rattle around is even more low-key but less melodic it revolves around skipping 2-step drums which stop and start while pads come and go like its the sound of a talented producer with broad horizons
lthough has released a lot albums his last one freaks r us was four years ago an eternity in techno three years before that was 20000 leagues under the skin which was as different from freaks as the scene in which he operates would have been: trancey chugging deep techno was later replaced by varied in-your-face electro the common denominator is an effortlessly solid and classic flair thats a kind bookkeeping music the past the reason for this seemingly misplaced discussion about albums in the singles section is course that is a preview to heils upcoming loving lp and from it we can assume that hell be reaching even further back in time than usual as both these tunes are straight out the early 90s the title the album course screams smiley soul rave and so does roland-style drums check circling happy mondays-style strings check chorded electric piano rhythm check the surprising thing is how he does it without sounding completely corny is up-to-date in a subtle way and although it probably wouldnt be the absolute toast the terrace party it would certainly set a damn good mood another tune from 1992 with the same drum machine organ stabs and gospel vocals emoting this be the love its hard not to say yes its got a 303 the intro is just a shade f jorks ig time sensuality but when the flutey whistling comes in its more like luke vibert in a serious mood would be perfect at sunset with the string breakdown coinciding with that subtle transition into the more fictional lamp-lit nighttime realm its my pick personally mainly for the acid line but both these tunes are retrospectives rare quality
yet another deep house release in soft chords a bassline full of depth and groove some claps yawn lacking in originality not quite is the originality first released in 1998 and snapped up here by and re-released with a limited edition vinyl-only edit from himself and a remix from justin the original containing little more than a kick drum bass some keys and that hypnotic synth is an unfussy raw and delightful classic house track thankfully the edit hasnt been played with too much and its timeless sound remains almost intact any 1998 creases have been ironed out and the groove has been calibrated for modern audiences other than a few tweaks the and are very close the trouble is somewhere along the line its lost some of its gruff charm the kick drum is less aggressive the bass warmer and the piano smoother what makes this edit stand out is the new looped and slow panning sound thats been run through a low frequency flanger effect high pitched and relentlessly menacing against the backdrop of sexy bass and mature chords it fits into like a glove justin s remix spanning the entire b-side has a techier feel has re-worked it into a rolling floor bouncer with spacious drums chords and a short vocal snippet well-arranged and well-produced i still cant help but feel that its been designed purely as a club tool giving yet another opportunity to be slung in the middle of a mix for the floor thats all well and good but it didnt need any help it was already a gem in the midst of many a record bag
theres a fine line between nostalgia and luddism and its one that treads heavily the french artists third album doesnt pine for the heyday of late-90s electronica as much as it sounds stuck in that era erwan castexs sweeping compositions echo the likes of mouse on mars ziq and warps influential roster rarely updating their proven ideas except in their impressive sound design its all meticulously crafted with a keen ear for mood and emotion and yet has trouble moving beyond a pastiche of castexs record collection variety has never been an issue for castex he can jump from weightless atmospheres to anthemic string sections to skull-crushing beats with aplomb this happens on but it takes time things get off to a strong start on (00) a determined swell of robust synths that climb into the stratosphere track two is another swirl of melodic tangents and emerges from that nebulous plateau with slow-crunching beats slide guitar and a bloated brass section the latter production shows castex piling sounds onto one listless melodic theme until it buckles under the weight does better elsewhere splitting the difference between chris clarks heavy boom-bap and idiology -style glitch starts the albums second half with an adventurous streak of maximalism castex switches gears on the somber interlude and uses to slowly ramp up into the caustic trawl of this dynamic narrative helps lend a sense purpose vocals add more personality to castexs work even when theyre used mostly as texture gossamer harmonies from montreal singer sea oleena lift the twinkling closer to dream-pop and though takes a technicolor trip-hop motif straight from music has the right to children its staccato vocal samples give the tired broken-beat nice rhythmic accents electro-ballad features a stirring performance by fr n ois marry which castex accompanies with his albums most distinctive production unfortunately closes on a low note is nondescript soundtrack filler all mid-tempos and crowded instrumentation neatly summing up s latest record in three minutes
s early musical education was in the classical world against whose strict codes of conduct she often chafed this rebellious streak or as she put it the urge to [do] things wrong for no reason helps explain the music she makes now her dance music has sharp elbows its rich layering not inducing dance floor transportation so much as frazzled unease her debut on which follows this springs breakout diary of a woman on she rocks is defined by this quality its a record of disorientating density gut-lurching turns and synth interference that needles at the eardrums sometimes its awkward in a bad way: the brief closer its is marred by an lfoed bass growl straight out of knock-off dubstep but mostly the berlin-based american seems to know exactly where shes going even if its a discomfiting place sometimes initial momentum gets trapped in uncomfortable stasis ( didnt call her music anxiety rhythm for nothing ) on this happens to doomy techno while on its to a lighter set of phasing arps and resonant-pitched percussion which in anyone elses hands would make for breezy house the circa 140 bpm doesnt bottle it instead gleefully overshooting dance floor psychedelia landing in a pile-up of shrill arps and lurid effects is the exception that proves the eps contrarian rule a cosmic 90-bpm chugger that rather than derailing erupts in plumes of gorgeous crystalline melody
with all the interzones being explored between dubstep house and techno of late its especially pleasurable to find a newcomer with a wholly different but congruent angle for one thing berlin-london duo jack dixon robin cardfix pile on the rolling breaks haunted vocal science and thrill-ride darkness of mid-90s drum bass theres a measured flickering-machine dub techno dryness to their production as well and it helps make dixon cards debut energetic without being frazzled the jungle feel is especially pronounced on the first three tracks on an echo-drenched jamaican-tinged male ey-ey-ey-aye that makes up half the vocal hook (the other is a womans wordless coo) comes out of a collective memory of mid-90s ragga jungle as much as dixon cards galloping snare work but the track moves with a lightly carnival hip-sway thats closer to what 2-step garage brought to the continuum and its followed by on which that skipping quality guides the beat though its closer to recent toybox-idm dubstep than anything groove chronicles would have done but even when the tone (and bass) gets dark as on the beats step too lively and the synths gleam too brightly to leave you in the lurch the remixes are a mixed bag colos slurry version of is arty and pretty but doesnt stick too much eliphinos remix layers on the synth glide and punches up the bass hits to good spirit-of-95 effect james s attaches a straight-four to the chassis and rides it through some pleasant whooshes

despite confrontational name s label is anything but home to some most consistently approachable and melodic drum bass over past decade labels output has struck an underground friendly note approachability without exactly reaching pop heights similarly reputable labels like hospital after ten years it releases its first compilation a collection tight clever drum bass ranging from songful to brutal one that succeeds by way its reliability ra r than its ability to shock and awe starting f in ra r glossy territory with s with a beat so light and smooth it feels like its sculpted from ivory compilation rarely lets that polished sheen fall f: even harder moments are coated in butter res a mixture newer names and drum bass heroes and surprisingly enough y rub shoulders without too much friction american producer mixes down and dirty techstep and albums surplus lustre with his fantastic same while throws in so taut it can barely move a four minute exercise in how to recapture some that prime era drum bass magic with simplest ingredients while compilation does prove that new wave drum bass isnt just a bunch autonomic whisperers or noisia rip fs its old guard that shines brightest wins best in show with appropriately academic all razor blade pinpricks and tinkling pianos until it drops out into a free falling breakdown provides a typically cinematic gem with technoid (with some help from and ) digs up some ugliest drums this side counterstrike with thrilling and s p y drops a nugget imaginative songwriting with alternating between earth shaking drops and heart in mouth breakdowns s label doesnt have musicality shogun nor pop bent hospital; ra r it depends on a cutthroat quality control and a keen eagle eyed purview drum bass scene that aligns it with a similarly amorphous juggernaut like critical as such feels more like a compilation well selected tracks a few stunners mixed in with a few just okay standard bearer contributions ( ) so even if it doesnt feel like kind explosive and celebratory thing you might expect from a decades worth retrospection from a label like youd be hard pressed to find a more consistently listenable eighty minutes drum bass anywhere else
suits ties austerity and rhythm at first glance german three piece s live take on dance music certainly appears similar at least in terms aesthetic to that their countrymen and fellow lovers the motorik groove kraftwerk however debut full-length is a much more warm-blooded concern than the robot-infused rhythms created by the elderly statesmen dance daniel brandt jan brauer and paul fricks set-up includes drums glockenspiel rain stick trombones and harp pretty much anything outside synthesised sounds in other words although their playing is either treated or cleverly cut-up sampled and fed back to itself the emphasis is on real instrumentation an approach which has seen the group likened rather aptly to the likes minimalist composer steve reich so how does it actually sound the best songs from the nine are those which turn the house template inside out and its accompanying video cleverly deconstructs a house rhythm instrument-by-instrument before meticulously piecing it back together rw wouldnt sound out place in a rinse out by robert hood balances classical flourishes with an almost human sounding pulse while teufesleiter brings the record to a close in a suitably dramatic climax its full bangs strings and crashing which fall around a creeping electronic backbone it also may feature one the sleaziest tuba lines youve ever heard while the danceable mischievous elements the album stand out other tracks such as and the title track stray away from the dance floor to limited result and when the virtuoso tendencies the group take over some the personality bbf is replaced by a c fee table politeness leave aside these small complaints though and youre left with a rarity these days: a unique album that fers an experimental fusion capable moving both the head and the feet

some ideas are so obviously great that you kick yourself for not thinking of them first getting renowned producer and dub pioneer to remix a bunch of dubstep tracks is one of these ideas and you can thank and his tectonic label crew for your self inflicted wounds its a savvy move: having hopeton brown the musics ancestor reconfigure these tracks in his own legendary manner not only legitimizes dubstep through acknowledgment from its origins but pins it close to its roots at a time when its flying farther and farther away from them launches step into outer space comes packaged with an extra disc of the original tracks and tectonic went one step further in procuring original and exclusive tracks from dubsteps biggest names rather than going the easy route of delivering a bunch of rinsed out classics into s hands they take a risk that pays off instead of castaways or leftovers each producer delivers work on par with their absolute best s lets loose choking gaseous clouds while s is his finest tune in years loading enormous weight into each bar without resorting to overtly aggressive lfo recent tectonic superstar provides the out there where aboriginal chanting lurks in the outskirts and bristol dub king s is a poppy slice of vocal reggae dubstep listening over the originals it begins to feel like tectonic could have just released these and had a masterpiece on their hands thankfully does more than just turn each track into a versioned dub template instead he meticulously tinkers notably keeping within the confines of dubstep tempo deconstructing rhythms widening spaces and submerging frequencies underwater brown dissects and examines before building meaner sometimes leaner versions: his reworks vary from microscopic tightening ( s otherwise freeform ) to sprawling deconstructions (the psychedelics of s otherwise mundane ) original structure of the tracks usually remains intact and rather than a gimmicky dub album he builds a forward thinking record full of dubstep rhythms that arent afraid to break or splinter unpredictably outside of already ill defined rules best results come when brown works with idiosyncratic tracks like s where he wedges pounding beats in the middle of winding melodies and nearly drowns the synths heightening their euphoric impact when theyre finally allowed to come back for air s lurching horror dirge is given a new lease on life when doubles up the percussion and s unique dubwise swagger is exaggerated to top heavy extremes projects crown achievement is s the first new release from the swamp81 label boss and digital mystikz since 2008 where the original is a pitch perfect throwback to dubsteps formative years turns its joyous halfstep into throbbing threats so tense theyre suspended in mid air melting the pads into uneasy mocking moans res something grandiose about launches step into outer space from its considerable implications to its stupefying sonics tectonic have successfully bridged the gap between one of the worlds fastest growing dance musics and its stylistic progenitor by inverting backward looking classicism into audaciously unstable experiments tectonic and have rendered conceptions of time and canon irrelevant
cathartic purging and even the use of drugs to replicate states of extreme illness is a part of many healing traditions says in the press release for his single on the new label that may be so but these two tracks are better suited for dance floors than shamanic rituals yre very good: lengthy slow-burning pieces from the bleaker end of post-disco and techno hefty drum-machine hits and thick acid lines are the order of the day on with gentle pads adding lightness and short bursts of drums delivering little shocks along the way it builds momentum subtly over its ten-minutes russom adding new elements without breaking the tracks hypnotic spell also coasts on a steady pulse but here russom uses flecks of synth tinny rings and little blurs of noise to flesh out the tracks skeleton perhaps thanks to its longer length a luxuriant 13 minutes feels less vital than but theres still plenty of detail to get lost in
the title track on the a-side is a glitchy minimal house groover the track has a real electronic feel to it with tight rhythms using occasionally offset staccato snares before the drums pause and the low end disappears a huge sweeping filtered whoosh which develops into a buzzing hairdryer noise begins to dominate until it completely overshadows the rhythm this acts as a dynamo for the track with its vibrating reverberating effect certain to cause head spins if listened to at the right volume after all this subsides its back into that tight minimal rhythm which is very much like the sleeparchive stuff that has been doing the rounds of late a general-purpose type of track which could be a useful tool in many a djs set (6/10) through its clever use of subtle rhythm and its accessible feel polytet 3 suggests it could be the favourite for most on this release swishy sounds unfurl and build in the background as the track develops before a proggy type synth and bassline is added this synth starts in a subdued manner before rising up along with the swishing filter sound to almost deafening proportions - the ultimate attention seeker this too should spin a few heads on the floor and i imagine it could be quite effective in slowly turning up the heat inside a club (7/10)
paul rose really is the man of the moment he produced one of the biggest tracks of the year in loss mixed a dj kicks compilation to match and somehow overcame the trance taboo with drenalin then theres his berghain residency and his renowned hotflush recordings re you tired of hearing these facts yet im approaching that point thankfully the brits impeccable productions have infinitely more replay value ssuming his techno guise once again rose gets this release with the stomping its actually kind of disappointing at least when placed alongside his previous work water-spray hi-hats a shaker and metallic jingles combine for an impelling rhythm section this basic substrate is solid but on the whole it doesnt really go anywhere instead the rapid-jabbing synth-work marches on the spot and the layers seem to interfere with each other more than they complement on the flip side is cleaner using a similar bass timbre to those found in loss and drenalin it nonetheless moves forward a lot more cautiously taut stabs build and break the first three quarters of the song the piece de resistance however is the whirling acid line which is introduced towards the finish its had all the usual 303 liquid wrung out of it leaving just a damp centrifugal motion to spin us towards home dd this one to the growing list of hackneyed (but totally valid) remarks about paul roses career
seven records in nearly two dozen if you count digital-only releases munichs finally coaxes a proper two-track single out of who co-runs the label with his brother marco s the title m suggests this is a track made for a very specific context in mind: its undoubtedly techno and aimed at the early morning hours ut you wont need to look at a clock to know that the peak hour is long past once this comes on the energy is hardly flagging; its more that it has dug in for the long haul girding itself with a stolid bassline steadfast hi-hat patter and rattling sheets of white noise that mimic the ceiling coming down in great flaky chunks what it might lack in en klock or marcel dettmanns relentlessness it makes up for in a gorgeous blossoming of chords in the latter third soft luminous shapes that take the track to an unexpected place more pastoral than industrial is a similarly dusky affair but its somehow far livelier despite the fact that its beat structure isnt that different from m here though the swing is more pronounced thanks to the rhythmic interplay between shakers and a nimble little handclap pattern: theres something almost sexy about it with velvety chords veiling a slinky irrepressible groove crucially theres no four-to-the-floor downbeat; the tune reserves its kicks for the one and the three giving it a fleetness of foot thats unusual for such resolutely techno atmospheres
s latest record is significant for a few reasons firstly is the debut release on his new label sample hold but more importantly it marks a return to the tough techno the berlin-based producer built his career on but abandoned after donning his agaric moniker and turning to lighter sounds in the mid-00s skoogs comeback makes me wonder what weve potentially missed out on over the past decade as has just about everything you could want from a dance floor-focussed techno 12-inch the swede takes a variety of approaches on his best and most memorable moments are when a tracks main feature is essentially a wall of sound and are prime though very different examples the former is the kind of tune that completely enthrals a dance floor perfectly combining emotion with pounding intensity through long and immersive synth chords and heaving metallic percussion the latter is much more sinister and probably likely to energise more than hypnotise it makes use of relentless drums and another high-impact mid-range the results are also great when skoog takes his foot off the pedal is heady and atmospheric but still punches hard down low with dubby stabs and a housey bounce is the records only chilled moment but this too is pure class lets hope skoog still has a few more records like this up his sleeve
ggboroughs swooning midnight confessional modal put squarely on my ones-to-watch list last year acked by the equally evocative ats which took smouldering techno to another level the record had me anxious for what was next thankfully kitten play by ggboroughs partner in crime one track rain didnt disappoint the two have been tag-teaming like this for the last five ot releases and now theyve handed the reins over to young for the first bomb of is a nod to manchesters carpark venue of the same name best known as the home of the warehouse project and those long nights of sweaty revelry inform s opening swing tribal repetition has always been a bit of a mancunian trait and is buzzing with such rattles ticks and woodblock hits its pretty ravey one-for-the-lads with that mate sample reverberating through the polyrhythms proper manchestah indeed then is the afterparty cure and a far more mellow affair warm undulations sooth and caress while gentle beats keep things plodding along lazily its the finishing touch on s rather stonking debut

s peculiar strain of squashed and rigidly fashioned instrumental hip-hop has infiltrated heads for months now in fact his particularly masculine brew of square wave stomping dates back to 2008 so its a little odd to think that this the ep on will only be his second solo 12-inch it nonetheless both underlines his accomplishment to date as well as marking a confident stride into the arena of competition right from the off with the title track squeezing out a jagged-edged bass riff wanders like an overexcited child through a forest of easter eggs; haphazardly jumping off the beaten path checking every hiding place strong slow drums frame the breakdown on as sluga adds wispy synths that lift the ear back into the whirling of the bassline when it reappears the two other more up-tempo numbers and display his talent for thumping drums hard forcing his punishing love of heavy-as-hell simplistic rhythms right on you whether you like it or not the remaining three tracks on the ep aptly display a keen ear for synth colouration and melody even if theyre all primitive computerized rgb in hue taking the toy town sounding pony production value of some of skweee musics shining lights as a starting point sluga pours his own compression-happy technique into his song workings letting the distortion of the drums pull the focus rather than the throwback novelty of some of the resounding 8-bit sounds is the epitome of this style: literally booms out his kick drums and thick lfo-heavy basslines over synths that have been lifted straight out of segas early 90s end of level boss music library
is the filthy acid alias of albert van abbe a dutch techno and ambient producer whose deep dark and spacey wares have been steadily mounting over the years last may this culminated in van abbes debut album champagne palestine which was crafted around a set of dreamy piano fragments it was a light and sparkling lp ideal for listening to while lounging around the name harks back to van abbes early years performing gnarled live sets at illegal parties in the early 00s it had been gathering dust until 2014 when a collection of archival material surfaced is the first set of new recordings but the old sentiment is there gurgling and gurning the first release for is a bawdier beast than champagne palestine from its luminous yellow outer sleeve to the dark and twisted grot inside this record is about one thing and one things only: rave aside from its two digital bonuses the grimly hulking and the slow vitriolic boil of all four cuts are warehouse-ready bangers is euphoric with an electro tinge while is moody and drip-fed the others are tough grotty and will send a dutch crowd into a meltdown
s name was coined by dis magazine s solomon chase during a mushroom trip in which he conceived of a colour that didnt exist the group made up of fatima al-qadiri nguzunguzu and j-cush operate on the same level musically fusing rap dancehall and other styles to form what sounds like a dystopian genre from some far-off epoch s early appearances particularly a moma ps1 performance that involved choreographed basketball drills made them seem like an over-conceptualized art project but once the actual music started trickling out it was a different story first there was worlds mine a rough-around-the-edges blueprint for the global sound they would flesh out a year later with a club anthem centered on a simple and defiant question: dont you wanna party the single positioned not as highbrow experimentalists but as makers of post-globalization internet-friendly party music the rest of takes as a jumping-off point tackling different regional sounds and sub-genres with the same dark palette a lot of that comes down to the familiar sonic hallmarks of al-qadiri and nguzunguzu: hushed synthesizers tropical percussion inflated with reverb and a sense of space that leaves the spotlight on the guest artists the groups individual backgrounds blend together like watercolour paints creating a consistent adaptable style that works well across such a wide spectrum of sounds in fact succeeds exactly where so many collaborative albums fail because the group take the time to understand and mold to the artists theyre working with just listen to the way they tailor the masterful start-stop opener to tinks way of switching between rapping and singing or how they effortlessly fold cumbia into the mix on vern culo the sicko mobb-featuring is so bang-on and warbly that it might as well be a song from one of the chicago duos own mixtapes it helps that these guests bring their a-game to kelela and ian isiah join forces for a wispy duet and riko dan explodes all over a fierce performance rivalled by jamaican artist timberlees vicious spitting on powerful verses from her 3d natee tink and others help cement what call their equal opportunity workplace fostering an even split between male and female artists thats almost unprecedented in rap music s reach doesnt always extend as far as they might like it to reunites the worlds mine trio but the aggression dissipates into a thinned-out facsimile of grime feels directionless and mismatches shawnnas snarling invective with a paper-thin instrumental that can barely contain her but most of the time they cough up beats that either complement their guests or challenge them to come up with something new each track is different enough to match the diverse cast yet self-contained enough for to feel like a worthy project on its own sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt but fatima al qadiri nguzunguzu and j cush have delivered a surprisingly solid record with a global outlook and more than a few surprises up its sleeve
s music may be new york in character but hes an international concern these days gracing techno bills across the western world consciously or not this is reflected in the latest release on his label which draws (blood)lines from s humble corner of the big apple to the parched post punk stylings of on the west coast and east to ostgun ton s home away from home and its poster boy the result is a satisfying three tracker that both cleaves to and invigorates s rugged aesthetic at first glance s seems straight up nasty its dissonant chords chafing against the groove like a pumice stone on tender skin listen closer though and youll realise that ugly downpitched voice is reciting a gas and electricity suppliers advertisement just the sort of cheeky non sequitur that seems at home on the corner s own functions nicely as a partner piece its equally dry and irritable and also deploys a voice this time what sounds like a radio transmission played back on a shagged out tape machine the spools repeatedly jamming and releasing s is the odd one out swapping scratchy machine funk for something darker and more richly textured theres still a voice but this time its soused in delay and joined by a guitar scraping and squealing dolefully in the middle distance when a single synth line makes its entrance in the latter half were treated to a moment of real beauty in amongst the bleakness
s music not only rewards but demands high volume each successive notch up the decibel scale reveals additional detail like the finer textures of a magic eye picture gradually emerging into focus the key components of the are simple enough pairing a gut-punch of a kick drum with a machine-gun synth motif that blazes a straight line across the surface enough to drive it forward with ruthless efficiency ostensibly its dramatically different from his rust-gutted new project covered in sand but as the track progresses the rough grain of its surroundings crackles to the fore all circular saw grind whipping wind and a mournful near-melodic whine in the distance reverbed sonar ping is used to great effect as the central feature of the theres something about that particular sound that taps into some deep-seated human impulse hinting toward sensations of loneliness and isolation here each forlorn bleep sends echoes rebounding outwards into its furthest reaches dragging dancers into the watery depths along with it
new orleans-style imagery and a release conveniently timed to hit the halloween season youd be forgiven for thinking that the (predictably) shadowy is not to be taken too seriously but youd be wrong there may be a glint in the producers eye as he made them but these four pithy tracks shuttle back and forth across the bass continuum with aplomb from jungle rhythms to ghetto tech to juke and all things in between opener grafts high-stepping drum bass to footwork tropes joyously employing the amen break and pile-driving drops summoning up the rump-shaking spirit of 2 live crew but shaving a sizeable portion off the bpm count bass uses abrasive sonar blips thunderous sub-bass and cut-up rap vocals it goes into nutty overdrive again with of a rollicking three-minute amphetamine-insane conga-filled juke-ish number the circle is completed by a dark mid-paced junglist stomp counteracted by breathless percussive juke tinklings

on the back of jean nipons latest record industry steal vol 2 is a dedication to 15 students accompanied by a small photo of a busy classroom presumably theyre attendees of magendie high school an institution whose location cant be found on google (also curious is the absence of an industry steal vol 1 on l i e s or elsewhere ) what can be said with some certainty though is that the eps a-side is a standout that earns its abrasive title 808 cowbells and short stabbing synth horns rattle around the track like ball bearings thrown down a steel pipe nipon tosses in reversed one-shots muffled wolf cries and plumes of ambient noise too and the out-there touches add spice to his raw club-tailored track the rest of industry steal vol 2 recycles that sound palette with light adjustments it wouldnt be entirely accurate to call womens a diet version of the though its six-minute stretch of chapped percussion and swirling ambience does bear more than a passing resemblance cheap and cheerful horns reappear on and aside from the wistful five-note phrase it too bears a few similarities to the a-side that said vol 2 s scrappy textures and smart grooves are hard to resist so any complaints will likely seem academic
etween the powerhouse trio of rhadoo raresh and petre inspirescu and relative newcomers like praslea and cristi cons romania has been consistently introducing the world to styles of techno and house relatively unheard and wholly mesmerizing for the last few years hometown hero label has been releasing music from its countrys finest for the last two years but for the most part they havent strayed far from stripped back and bizarre slow burning dj tools such as rareshs dry tool and pedros sub salcie the imprints latest though the debut from cinderfella ltd a moniker that many say that thomas melchior is behind breaks the mold and delivers a pair of techno stompers is as creative as it is simple the redundant loop of the vocal hook layered over a twisted evil circus-styled collection of keys and a bassline that oozes energy is one to work with while its easy to dismiss the production here as remarkably simple its the almost unnoticeable intricacies in the percussion that reveal the master craftsman behind this new production alias on the reverse the driving techno is replaced in with a bouncing tech house funk quirky tom work and a funky set of chimes and hi-hats give the composition a throwback feel but the cyclical nature of the piece save for the random bass rumbles unfortunately see it fall far behind its ep partner its not until the final minutes that any change seems to happen but its a minor one leaving listeners to wonder if melchior or whomever paid a tad too close attention to ricardo villalobos arrangement techniques
matt tolfreys has upped the ante considerably over the past few months with releases on three separate labels big daddy sub-labels limited is this making hay while the minimal sun shines as it were nd as is the way with most ventures as the output goes up the quality control begins to suffer case in point being s original of which has so little going for it they might not have bothered the nasty flat kick proggy brooding bass 303 gurgles occasional hiss plod along for a good five minutes before an annoying one-note stab drifts in you can smell the dramatic break coming yup there it is the bleating stab carries through almost until closing time not good enough salvation comes in the shape of a fine remix from the increasingly interesting lexi who up raise both game tempo taking little from the original apart from the dry drums austere approach they create a sleek busy bubbler that works very effectively in the mix hell even that annoying stab gets a second chance at success mkii a subtle but key element getting phased filtered tweaked into action s with their previous work on plus8 the intricate percussion is a joy to behold (if that sort of thing makes you happy): fills rattles rolls snaking in out of the mix constantly changing as the track progresses - its the kind of thing that you ll be interested in even if you think youre not dd two effective drops youve got yerself a winner the good ship is steadied
workshop co-founder jens kuhn approaches house with the intricate craftsmanship of a toymaker his ticking wind-ups charm with whimsical grooves and novel melodic flourishes but just as you think youve got their inner workings figured out a new element springs into action and changes everything take ngstrom the lead track on his new ep for leipzigs polyfon opening with a plinking drum pattern a few simple synth phrases and a twinkle of bell kit its a quirky tracky trifle with a tightly circling groove but the late arrival of sober strings comes as a total recalibration the track suddenly transformed by the idiosyncratic multi-layer interplay of brightness and brooding n intriguing curio akin to nton zaps recent spain ngstrom s grooves are neatly interlocked but its personality is tough to pin down the quivering but bouncy house of has a familiar retro palette but any lingering classicism is buried beneath a lopsided eccentric funk all its own one thats uplifting and eerie in equal measures meanwhile grows from a bulbous floppy bassline that wobbles and wriggles through a haze of imploring strings and ghostly samples juxtaposing a daydream sway and a sleazy shimmy is pregnant with tension but also funky as hell fans of or workshop wont want to miss it or for that matter any of the tracks on this stellar ep
in the past 12 months has reinvented himself as a prime purveyor of big and brawny techno via the dense pika project with lex jones chris speros first ep for carries that groups sasquatch-sized footprint but lacks some the barreling momentum that makes that projects recent work so vital sounds as if its trying to be the biggest track of the year ll the elements are there: commanding kick drums a repetitive vocal sample and a sleazy bassline everything is in its right place and played at the right time it could make for quite a weapon; on its own terms however it never quite amounts to more than the sum of its parts is more interesting but its hardly a club jam its robotic and thin as paper like kraftwerk at their most melodic the pleasant diversion is made more palatable by a house rework from tom the eps best moment the digital-only with its emphatic horn stabs almost outdoes the -side while a remix of by ondon outfit soul project doesnt do much good or bad to the originals sturdy thump

helmed by little white earbuds editor steve mizek s stated focus is on showcasing merican talent launched this time last year with an ep by veteran mir lexander the chicago label has since released music from olin pittsburgh track uthority and most recently policy their fifth release is the debut ep from detroit-based newcomer - rugged and with a sound indebted to her hometown knots clashing loops alongside sporadic bursts of analogue instrumentation battling for supremacy the components never quite sync or reach a climax the drum arrangement on b-side is equally abstract and crowded but theres more of a hook this time with rave-like piano chords and a scale of bells providing the pull the more spacious and melodic stronomical is the eps standout with arresting chimes suspended over faded yet frenetic drums its this spellbinding quality that suggests the best is still to come from merrick-

somewhat frustratingly for the rest of us portland-based producer johnny jewel seems to have found his niche recruiting attractive singers to his various disco projects having already released albums with chromatics and glass candy (fronted by ruth radelet and da no respectively) jewel formed after spotting vocalist megan-louise singing in a al bar joining them is drummer nat walker from chromatics making a kind of supergroup of musicians from new jersey label the stewardship of mike simonetti the fledgling imprint has become synonymous with blissed-out disco and now boasts quality acts like bottin tiedye and professor genius in its stable but its jewels projects that feature prominently: chromatics 2007 album night drive along with the after dark compilation of the same year first brought d b into the limelight this offering is very much in keeping with jewels style: sharp piano stabs and synthesizers form a subtle icy backdrop to sultry vocals what sets jewels work apart from many other disco acts is his reluctance to use computers and new equipment in both production and live performance thus giving the music an analog quality that is infinitely more arresting than most contemporary disco counterparts the majority of the lyrical content is bleak; this is not an album that grabs you on the first listen nstead found myself slowly succumbing to its charms after several runs through is the most accessible and dancefloor-orientated song on the album with louise echoing that well-worn fairytale phrase mirror mirror on the wall whos the fairest of them all then her dark lyrics come to the fore: worked so hard and for what show me your heart and ll show you my blood after dont a classic piece of disco-noir the album takes a noticeable spin towards the melancholic with prominent talo beats replaced by slower moodier synths and high-end piano on mens reve a saxophone solo follows an introduction reminiscent of a needle running over vinyl (as previously used by jewel in chromatics n the city ) jewels instruments take a back seat to megan-louises vocals on while cant with three minutes of static after the track is finished brings to a moody wordless close

s excellent 2011 long player phantom continues to churn out source material for a rich run of remixes this time its which gets tackled by cosmin while (the flip side of phantom s lead single) is left in the capable hands of oddika if you stalk the latter on facebook youll know he seems to treat his 303 as a special treat only to be brought out when he most deserves it in the days leading up to this remix then he must have been immaculately behaved for acid rips right through its centre in the wake of said warbling bleeding and molten lines spare percussive loops play out over and over decaying ever so slightly cosmins effort meanwhile is instantly recognisable as his own: built on a bed of fizzing low-end frequencies it rumbles and rattles before exploding into life and surfing along with shuffling hits and claps
dark techno producer may claim to be influenced by heavenly bodies on this release for but in reality it has more in common with underground releases from the 90s than interplanetary exchanges features one of s typically gloopy basslines: its murky and dense but doesnt detract from the other elements these include snippets of hardcore-era vocals and the driving percussion that prevailed on fuses substance buse however while that long-lost hawtin classic spewed out acidic invective prefers to drop the kind of eerie bleep patterns that youd expect from a function record despite using such distinctive sounds from diverse sources as its key components still manages to avoid falling into a generic trap on the other hand is far more contemporary sounding and includes many of the nuances that dominate modern-day techno; there are the ruskin-style panning riffs the van hoesen-esque clanging metallic sounds and prologues predilection for a filtered climax yet despite ticking all of these boxes it sounds merely functional and less inspiring than perhaps its due to the fact that brings back memories of technos golden age or maybe its because sounds so inextricably linked to the present but on this occasion the twins trump the virgin
having piqued the ear many with his debut coiled and the awesome router an anthem partly responsible for the strong vocal renaissance within future thinking garage music has taken his sweet time with his release schedule quietly putting out a 12-inch for scubas hotflush imprint before rounding f 2009 with a bootleg white label another superbly vocal-led roller memories starting the ball rolling in for his own label an imprint he runs with ben ufo and ramadanman s six track ep has a lot to live up to; or rather it has his lack output to exceed it proves its worth from the get-go though with the bumpy marching drums and ascending bass/organ combo which positively bursts into life at the chorus with yet another strong female vocal hook and lolloping snares flamming on every other bars second beat is an apt and sensitive display s minimal approach as he rolls s t pads before hushed organs behind a progressing drum beat that skips with all those little percussion flickers and hurried flourishes that pepper most the hessle labels output keeping his mix simple he lets his bubbling melody breathe but later smothers it with fighting layers screeching female vocals 5-htp seems built from a more junglist sound palette with those classic boom resonating bass stabs ebbing away behind constant hi-hat flourishes fbeat snares and a machine hum its at this stage that you really notice his talent for arrangement as he uses the piano-riddled sample to completely switch the tone while stuttering and underpinning his main snare hits to accentuate the rhythm as it accommodates the subtle melody its a constant running theme throughout his work; sees him letting his eerie vocal sample ring out before weaving in the warbling synth hook adding the constant percussion to drive the impact and frame the progression s vision can sometimes start to sound a bit bleak thanks in no small part to his talent for fusing sprawling chords with layers atmospherics but with a quick smattering winding synth on he immediately manages to lift the track and take it somewhere drastically different playing up the awkward riff and amplifying its impact and on closer he does things that completely contrast the preceding bars as if hes feeding himself deeper into the recesses his late night recording sessions even though there is dance floor fodder on tracks like and the buzzwords for this ep should be depth and subtlety much like the way chooses to irk out his music slowly his productions take that extra bit time to creep up on you gradually becoming more and more infectious
the observant reader will notice that this review is really rather late honestly thats because this record leaves me somewhat stumped the remix most people will be after is of course the dam eyer one he takes eulbergs chaotic pastoral rave and does the dam eyer thing to it in other words adds a rather huge stomping kick drum and generally ramps up the intensity nd intense it certainly is however and this is a completely subjective opinion ive rather fallen out of love with heavy kick-driven techno and the whole affair makes me rather yearn to hear the original instead ut still for what it is its extremely effective and the techno faithful will no doubt love it renato on the other hand turns in a mix which starts out as flanged and progressive and then transforms into something shrill and enthusiastic halfway through right at the end theres an enjoyable relief records-esque scratchy jacking groove but this is regrettably brief i can see it fitting very well into a progressive house set at peaktime but minimal fans will probably find it a little boring and lacking in rhythmic verve these mixes both do a splendid job of turning the song into their respective genres and so long as you take a genre-driven approach to dance music theres nothing wrong with that
man achieves his tallest measure of serenity when surrounded by beauty industrial designer henry dreyfuss once said its as true for what we listen to as it is for what we see touch by that measure manfredi romanos contribution to the long running kicks series is hugely successful thats no surprise as the artist aka is one of clubl s go to guys when it comes to moody meditative atmosphere though the life and death cofounders selections may not rival a view of say the gr canyon or the c zanne wing of your local art museum kicks has a hushed elegance thats innately alluring first disc focuses on graceful mood pieces with pulsing rhythms occasionally punctuating the reverie evocative minimalism of s delicately emerges from the crystalline gr eur of s while s appropriately named blinks its way into the glassy percolation of lodies occasionally ooze towards new age sentimentality but the patiently unfolding mix heavy on selections from the more amiable ends of ambient idm generally keeps any potential treacle factor in check second disc can be thought of as the dance floor set but even with the near constant presence of a 4/4 pulse it would be a stretch to call it peak time club music opening with the hypnotic tremble of s the session slowly winds its way through placid house techno romanos own mix of s go has the feel of a hazy twilight at summers end s from his 00 album point blank is one of the detroit artists more muted tracks with soft synths spiralling around syncopated chords a jazzy rhodes riff even the tougher tracks arent exactly gut punchers low end throb of for example has a hint of swagger but its stuttered ululations fine cut filigree convey an aura of fragility romanos always had a knack for transitions a talent he displays throughout both discs blends are unhurried sometimes barely noticeable tracks stack atop each other in ways that feel natural unforced he can make connections that others might miss like when the foggy dub of slides into the bouncing bassline of perch ballare by (the man behind the italo deviance blog label) or when the loping bittersweet electro pop of s eases into the swoons of s se are gorgeous moments in a release thats swimming in them but theres a downside to all this refined radiance except for a h ful of moments the live wire crackle of or the dreaml disco of r s anuary (listed here as ) both mixes can easily glide by in a narcotic haze a bit of abrasion here or a sharp thematic turn there wouldve enhanced the mixs quiet ebb flow its a seductive installment to the kicks series but one that could have used a bit more gritand
when i spoke to nina kraviz about her a last year she said that she looks for music that is almost not done completely you know theres like another final step that has to be done to call this song a finished thing but i dont want it to be finished because my imagination is rich enough to finish it itself this might explain why s tracks have found a home on her label appearing on the compilations i have a question and sleep not found the lesser-known russians music is extremely pared-back but a few smart details make it rich with atmosphere and implication his tracks so far have been druggy accretions of down-pitched voice and sneaky techno funk and his debut solo ep explores a few other options without losing that unrefined charm cleaves closest to his older tracks only with a shot of jittery energy the drums swing hard the voices are terse and the melody jumpy dirty ) is even harder and the obvious lead track careening along at a kraviz-approved 140 bpm while a synth lead ties itself in knots the energy drops on the b-side with an oddity in zuckermans discography its sinuous pads are almost soulful and the steadier clap-kick groove is only occasionally troubled by flickers of half-heard voice this track comes closest to losing zuckermans trademark weird intrigue which he makes up for on the bizarre which sounds like a straight-off-the-dat chicago jack track with an added slug of 21st-century dread
describing house records as economical or efficient rarely sounds sexy but daubs some glitter onto s functional tailoring with a buttery smoothness and elastic percussion these tracks are supple and substantial enough despite their slim foundations of clipped vocals hazy synths hand drums and not much else stretching to nearly ten minutes is testament to s smart arrangements wringing as much as possible from a handful of organic sounds the track is given some techno bite by 909-type cymbals but it mostly eschews direct force for a more subtle power s music often imbues minimalist ideas with gentle melodies he makes light work of the task on which is more scenic than his recent mistress eps s turns a vowel into a ribbon strewn through snapping drums and synths that swoop in sharp arcs whose bass notes are plucked over smooth prescription-esque melodies sounds like on cruise control his music is more enticing when moving through the gears
believe da hype - this is an absolutely massive release from already flying high with e samba the infectious french house groove hes used for the original version of will totally win you over the breakdown on the original is brilliant a whoosh of atmospheric bringing back the main riff through the filter thats before we even get to the vocals - robert smith (yes the cures robert smith ) will be tearing up commercial house dancefloors with his im flying again lyric irresistible and set to be a huge hit europe-wide this winter

german producers daniel varga michael kubler have spent most of their career as hovering in the background behind the girls on 2003s right now it was french singer laetitia who glossed their debut album with sultry gallic vocals in the style of charlotte gainsbourg on 2007s pleasure s pretty they replaced her with sascha hedgehog from french punk group les quitriche who intoned tales of tainted love with all the emotion of a self-service till that hardly made them unique of course the last decade hasnt been short of kohl-eyed singers doing their best m s kittin or ladytron impressions over casio keyboard beats but while threw their skinny arms around the electroclash aesthetic in many respects they also showed an affinity for more contemporary house techno creating something they dubbed indie house s third album ostensibly fronted by hedgehog again though she only makes a significant contribution to two tracks s see her reviving her ice maiden act singing lines like re so nice / m so mean both could be cryogenically frozen tracks from s earlier records elsewhere on the lp its varga kublers sleek supple techno that dominates propulsive and the streamlined title track further develop the style they hinted at on the recent blackout ep for tems and things hedgehogs voice when it appears at all typically cons ts of little more than the odd word or two processed repeated throughout the track such as the robotic incantation trust me on ts all taut well-produced stuff bouning s rubbery bassline the subtle crescendos of in particular use tension release in a way that proves are no dance floor amateurs but fans might be d appointed with the lack of lyrics also mostly d pensed with melodies hooks opting instead for tiny vocal snippets all of th makes feel like a club-friendly remix album n turning the spotlight away from the face of the b have made an album thats difficult to pick out from a crowd
is the kind of record youd expect tin man and gunnar haslam to make it weds the formers wide-ranging acid with the latters excursive techno into music that does them both justice theyve each explored the album format well enough on their own but on theyve collaborated to deliver a proper acid freakout from start to finish has two parts split by the sprawling ambient piece eases us into the first half with a gentle pulse and a silvery 303 line that snakes through hazy chords and soon remind us however that this is a club record albeit a pretty eerie one is like an idm prologue to the lovely immersive sonic wash that follows begins s second half with a sense of urgency though its club sensibility is deeply submerged the furious incessant notes on make a more purposeful move towards the dance floor makes you wait but when its waves of arpeggios finally break its well worth it closes the record with pure 303 psychedelia brushed with something a little breezier the producers masks seem to slip a little here more than on the rest of the album theres a sense of the two collaborators making themselves heard in the music its an interesting diversion for and might just be the most admirable part of
still fresh from their excellent first release by label boss max graham comes out swinging with their second release from up and comer matt phillips or otherwise known as born and bred in belfast northern ireland matt has grown up with an appreciation for the progressive sound and anything closely related while his influences stem from the prodigy to sasha digweed both tracks here showcase what is all about - deep and groovy to melodic and uplifting the first track is new driver and is definitely the drawcard on this release the slow building of the track really strengthens the presence of the melodic synths and swirling samples while waiting for the tracks glory simple beats with constant layers of uplifting sounds and melodies blend perfectly to add that hint of control after a smooth breakdown the track hits its peak with a superb synth hook/riff leaving its signature on the overall impression of the mix quality progressive trance united nations is on the flip and keeps things on a more progressive tip the mood is set instantly with dark drums and tribal-like percussion while a short moaning vocal makes appearances sporadically again the slow build of the sounds hooks and samples are present and are so effective in giving the track stages but dont forget the nice inclusion of a droaning bassline the breakdown is handled nicely with smooth break beats as the moody effects and vocal create the depth needed the second half of the track brings to life earlier synth hooks as they take the track down to its original form both tracks hold their weight in gold the production is flawless and each track seemed to hit that emtional spot in me matt is definitely giving progressive a good name

they dont come along very often but when they do an release is guaranteed to get people of a certain persuasion all hot and sweaty nd weve been waiting - 2006 was supposed to see his second artist album on the peacefrog label but its been put back to this year the swedes 1998 debut groove la chord remains a proper classic and its (unexpected) recent inclusion on the jesse rose-compiled ody language 3 comp should see a new demographic discovering his sounds for his latest 12 deep technos littlest hobo beds down with the crew for the night - with some surprising results lead track follows his by now trademark arrangement - a phased bassline underpins the track from the get-go complemented by a gentle kick before the main event arrives: an oscillating crystalline riff that weaves and twists its way through the ten-odd minutes of drops peaks and subtle surges backed up by some choice hi-tech synths fogies will fret that the riff owes more to untrendy trance than detroit - but screw them this is instant hi-definition techno erghain will appeal to the heads more - it lacks the drama of the -side but stick with it: the buzzing bassline and confident dry percussion contrast beautifully with the undulating deepnfluid pads making it the more likely straight-up floor-shaker
with a fast-and-furious release schedule a preference for remix-stuffed eps over simple two-trackers and growling hunger for unheralded talent new yorks throne of blood is grabbing contemporary dance music by the horns like few other labels right now favoring tracks classic in form yet wildly contemporary in sound the label has found a staunch ally in aka andrew cole whose peculiar sides for the likes of we play house and black sheep trax are as seemingly incongruous with house mores as they are resonant with them in terms of mood s nip ep might be one of label head james friedmans (and s) lowest-key releases in a minute but it might also be the highlight of their recent run is a minimalist at heart: rather than build and break down by stacking or subtracting huge numbers of instruments and effects he keeps a pretty steady ensemble and moves things along with more subtle compositional strategies is the embodiment of a highly musical approach employing just a couple of key elements a humble electronic kit a ping-ponging chord a couple well-placed crescendos for the sort of epicness most guys would crash their computers trying to achieve anything cole left to our imagination is filled in by newcomers infields who dont so much remix as expound upon s original intent even for is subtle with slivers of autechre-esque melody and tastefully druggy asides drawing listeners ever inward closing with the crisp snares tough-to-place strums and playful acid of the ebullient cole sums up the releases allure in full: sophisticated yet unpretentious minimal yet never brittle its a pleasure whose richness takes you by surprise

theres a straightforward elegance to the second part of s space odyssey on if the first instalment was more outgoing melodically and stylistically this 1 -inch dispenses with some of the edge to float in a place that suggests the titles have not been arbitrarily chosen this could also be interpreted from the order in which these tracks have been assembled: we began with colliding stars and we end with colliding stars with the split into white and black dwarfs mapping this universes cyclical existence with a compass not just a quaint anecdote passarnis music is emblematic of such a vision fter the bustle of interstellar activity as heard in last years acidy bass-heavy effort comes the sparkle of an engendered the low-ends are more melody lines than bass and they nestle under choral pads and light chords in an exemplar of house music that works just as well lying down with eyes closed as it would establishing dance floor communion (its sound aesthetic might well reflect the visual spectacle you might imagine from one of these ) on the other hand to find out what a entails is to understand why its namesake here is so barren one suspects this has more to do with passaranis overarching plan for musical allegory than appealing to listeners (that or it could just be a handy dj tool ) the cycle completes itself with part which expectedly marks a return to a tuneful hoopla two distinct basslines chords moving from staccato to shiny and several interweaving arpeggios collide against one another as promised to close the odyssey with a supernova exploding at 1 0 bpm
mysterious cosmonaut has spent the past few years putting a spacey spin on 90s techno and rave sounds for his own elastic dreams imprint now he lands on for his first release on another label turns out to be an inspired pairing bringing a touch of the extraterrestrial to the uk labels more earthy deep house style is almost kitschy the little glissandos that curl up after each bar have an old-school flair and the track cruises on a bassline that could fit into a lindstr m track if it werent so pacey has a more assertive arpeggio that whirs like a ufo waiting to beam you up; with its attractive string riffs and gently insistent chords it makes a strong case for taking the trip slowing things down to an amble tiptoes by on a broken beat with exaggerated sci-fi synth whistles is probably s most retro release yet but its also one of his best
in his 1995 book ocean of sound david op recalled a visit to the garden in zuishun-in a centuries-old temple in kyoto japan holding a bamboo pipe to his ear op could hear water insects birds the scrape of an old woman digging weeds from a path and giant carp jump then flop back into the ornamental pond in the temples seclusion he was able to perceive sounds rarely heard in cities op also wrote of places in japan where the distinction between built and natural environments was less clear traffic lights could chirp ornothologically ; water sounds were piped into tunnels hiroshi yoshimura the pioneering environmental musician was among several artists commissioned to make music for man-made structures including pre-fabricated housing in the 80s on discogs you can buy one of these albums soundscape 1: surround for the price of an upmarket coffee table with 2016s goto no yoniwa or garden in the night examined the same boundary with a different approach it was a synthetic recreation of his local riverbank whose nocturnal thrum of insect chirps he remodelled electronically on his latest album themes of nature and nighttime become strange abstractions its 11 tracks represent landscapes folk traditions and daily routines connected to kanagawa where he lives depicts a yokai or monster spirit with odd a capella loops which drift into steve reich-like forms other tracks like use sound as scene-setting cues something possibly a fan or sandalled feet gently beats the ground synths hum solemnly bells and gongs flicker like candlelight seems ceremonial but the mood is informal and friendly other tracks seem less like portals to kanagawa than vivid sound hallucinations in a dense arrangement of water sounds marimbas throat noises guiro scrapes cello and woodwind sends fantasy and reality spinning down the whirlpool together in all the commotion a japanese term for confusion or surprise nani rings out s two main elements unsteady drum rolls and a hoarsely voice of the elderly go back and forth as though theyre arguing the albums eccentric personality is never more obvious than in s use of childhood-associated sounds cartoonish orchestral jingles and slapstick effects audible on and add surreal layers to his colourful world s past albums have been more conventionally satisfying kishine s instrumentation rich with chimes mallets bells and synths lay over soothing ripples of water and birdsong last years on the quakefish introduced ideas more fully formed here but still drew from the same blend of ambient and modern classical as composers like midori takada on the other hand takes occasional cues from more unlikely sources in the fluorescent collage of where sighing vocal synths mingle with funny animal samples the lp echoes james ferraro and especially hudson mohawke is otherwise remote from recognisable musical traditions or landmarks even the ones it claims to represent its often hard to make out kanagawas exquisite mountains rivers and seas as the national tourist board describes them in music as off-the-wall as this is a largely interior world a dream from which were roused only once begins with a croak and then dulling stillness as a bedside clock ticks birds sing and cars pass probably on the other side of a window if the blinds were drawn youd see dawn breaking
coming off the massive edit of janet jackson s r b junkie birmingham producer returns to original productions on this his second 2-inch for gerd jansons label sort of listening to these tracks youd be forgiven for thinking that they too were re-edits es production style is sample-heavy and focuses on the hypnotic qualities therein for instance relies on a quickly repeating vocal sample to undergird the proceedings while a plodding bassline allows room for a voice to repeat the phrase it was worth your while its only apparent after five of its eight minutes that what shes saying true because by that time youve given up wondering if there will be radical changes to the track and simply settled into the undeniable groove the same cant be said for like a 70s jean michel jarre cast-off the pulsating synth line is beautiful to listen to but its dancefloor potential is virtually nil ill listen to at home plenty of times im sure but it s that i hope to hear out soon it picks up the pace somewhat but follows much the same pattern as it sounds perhaps even more like an edit switching off as it does between two different themes throughout the piece over time though the two begin to merge one takes a vocal stab from the other the other takes a kick drum right back its a subtle trick but a remarkably effective one that helps raise this above the murk of most nu-disco overall another excellent 2-inch from
in the world of minimal house very few have the credentials of bogdan cilinca best known as cilincas reputation has been built on his carefully considered approach to the genre which hes helped to define over the past decade nd while the style may no longer have the same freshness it once did a few of its key proponents have outlived its heyday is one of them isnt flashy brazen or even outspoken but given the kind of music that cilinca has spent most of his career pushing it was probably never going to be it doesnt do the trainspotters any favours either rather than unveiling the closely guarded bombs he takes with him around the world cilinca almost exclusively features unreleased material from his home country s such the journey is very much in line with the kind of house romania is best known for smoky smooth and understated names on this tracklist will only be familiar to those still up to date with minimal a track from the relatively well known cristi cons and (who produce together as ) kicks things off without any fuss with hushed vocals and skippy drums paving the way for cuts from up and comers and visullucid craig remix of n s (the original according to cilinca has been a staple for the last 5 6 years ) seems to be the only track not produced by a romanian and gives things a nice boost two thirds of the way in nicoles emerges as the highlight of the mix its snappy drums and catchy midrange standing out among the comparatively restrained efforts before it by the time comes to a close cilincas skills as a selector have been proven mixs transitions are flawless and the interplay between the tracks is often just as interesting as the source material itself every selection is of the highest quality with virtually no weak moments across the entire 70 minutes but rather than encompassing cilincas 0 odd years in the business seems more like snapshot of the current state of romanian house in this task hes succeeded but if the time comes 0 years from now to look back on minimal this cd is unlikely to be one youre dusting off
originally released its last year as the first anonymous white-label 12-inch in their limited-edition blanc series john later revealed as its creator by finishing off his dj-kicks mix with belgian producer locked s remix of the track and that version features alongside four others on this belated full-scale release if youve heard the dj-kicks mix the most instantly familiar part of the track will be its breathy high-pitched vocal which pivots on repetition of the phrase taking me over the locked remix in its full seven-and-a-half-minute form clocks and rattles slowly into life before swelling into a sumptuous string-laden treat the original is a little sparer but still a luxuriant ride with the vocal joined by steady drums cushioned xylophone-like keys silken pads and the odd thunderclap effect the package also comes with two reworks by his stripped refix backlights the gorgeous vocal line with unobtrusive bass keys and percussive clicks while his refix nudges along in very similar fashion while maintaining a slightly more febrile atmosphere himself then offers up his own fisc version which deviates from the original as much as any of the versions here it finds echoing fragments of the vocal dancing over beautifully melodious pinging house keys finishing the package with a gentle dose of euphoria
as far as im aware norwich has never been known for its electronic music scene run out of local caf the bicycle shop new party and label is launching in an attempt to put the sleepy norfolk town on the map (or at least have it outlined in pencil) judging from their amusing facebook page the labels founder(s) are all about classic house spacey disco cats and analogue gear so it makes sense that manchesters inaugurates proceedings the resulting three-tracker is every bit as funky and rough-around-the-edges as youd expect opener does and deserves credit for its name alone but its also a very decent cosmic house track loose-fitting drums underpin a rubbery bassline before jolly synths an upbeat agogo line and a screechy melody join the fray when theyre all on at once it sounds a touch tangled but its a nice summery jam nonetheless vocals lifted from newsoms yard and glue form the backbone of the eps other original cut the less imaginatively titled her stark echoed vocals are the main attraction here splayed across an airy 103 bpm beat in a curious move chicago damn steers clear of the vocals altogether on the remix instead presenting a late-night take on dugs original he pulls it off largely thanks to the tracks hypnotic bassline and the hi-hats that flutter by its side
black dialect is an expressive vivid living language if we reject it how little have we gained and how much have we lost asks the voice in o parrishs now-classic ebonics even without these words the track would have represented a related argument: music that is rooted in reaction to racism birthed in struggle is an assertion of its creators subjectivity gentrified love part 2 arrives on the other side of that argument as the underground canonizes parrish and his peers the styles of music theyve wrought have been increasingly distanced from the contexts that produced them its not a big leap to connect the movement of musical tastes and that of taste in neighborhoods parrish continues to assert the significance of historicized listening enter whose vocals shift from the words in the title to leave the love to us and then to we belong to us track works in the same densely melodic idiom of recent releases by ge-ology and dego kaidi but with less steady sequencing res an emphasis on rhythm as human effort: claps change timbre and intensity as they proceed and g iro and woodblock percussion are subject to basic fatigue ode with duminie deporres and waajeed is also full of colliding melodies and rhythms but its less a general exploration than a purposeful mission track is firmly grounded by a broken rhythm its solemn guitar and insistent chords creating a sense of urgency funk represented here is improvisatory not freedom on display but another step in a tradition of preparation for the unforeseen
im not sure quite how theyre doing it only pressing ten records big in an unlikely land with a generous vinyl budget but remarkably with next to no online presence and a twitter following of fifty-three (at the time of this writing) records are always out of stock despite this apparently outstanding sales record youve probably never heard of them though if your musical wanderlust generally leads to the alearics you probably should quiet village is an obvious comparison but the yacht is equipped with proggier sails and richer stocks of melody which is why its a slight shame that it feels a bit static it reaches for the melancholic and gets there with an understated vocal muffled guitar and plenty of fluttering glissandos but its ambience lacks the enjoyably breezy chord progressions ergo romantic melodrama of their other work of which aby is a great example its all so wonderfully easygoing: the unhurried semi-quaver hats bass played with a raised eyebrow and cocked wink a guitar melody to soundtrack old holiday slideshows the track and seemingly the whole ethos is a tonic for the gruff

the next release on cass sabotage imprint comes from production outfit and they deliver a melancholic release in the heretic boys in cass and paolo mojo hook up to deliver a devastating mix for the b-side while the original is an intriguing piece of work coming out of the european country of georgia first up is the original mix and on the whole it is a smooth house journey with very nice deep string patterns and echoing vocals the beats are smooth enough and travel at a pretty down beat pace sitting at just above 120 the track builds nicely with smooth melodic stabs coming in deep into the production and it s then followed by some twisted synth patterns that merge well with the vocals which go up another level on the flip is the cass vs paolo mojo heretic mix for me this is the highlight of the release from the word go this remix has a very upbeat feel to it with smooth crisp drum patterns intertwining delightfully with the string patterns that build in the early stages the vocal builds with these elements and then goes solo in an early breakdown alongside the beautifully arranged string patterns the beats then kick back into gear alongside a very smooth yet deceptively chunky baseline baselines that gain in intensity and grittiness as the track progresses it is easy to see why this production tore the roof off at fabric when digweed dropped it recently another very solid release for the sabotage crew and with cass excellent giant forthcoming followed by a real gem in joe montana s boys it appears things are travelling quite smoothly at the london headquarters
ben baker billingtons output as certainly feels at home among all the outstanding electronic music has released over the last few years in addition to maintaining an impressive rack of vintage synthesizers (from korg and roland to sequential circuits and nord) he enjoys exploring the spacey middleground between kosmische musique concrete and what renowned critic and wnyc radio host john schaefer once labeled new music (i e where first-generation ambient and the new ge overlap) this however tells only half the story what distinguishes the chicago-based artist from label-mates like bee mask driphouse and three legged race is how he reconciles the progressive-electronic tradition with his considerable roots in experimental jazz and underground rock its a reconciliation that expresses itself in a number of ways on most notably the sweeping array of acoustic instrumentation on just about every track the longtime drummer for tiger hatchery billington is an absolute fiend for percussion; in addition to traditional drum kit he uses bongos shakers bells tambourine and even kitchenware yet hes also a versatile enough musician to be capable of adding upright piano flute voice and tabla one of s most arresting showcases for billingtons vision (as well as his musicianship) is whose amalgam of passionately swelling synths frenetic electric-piano and chorus of cries and moans feels very much haunted by mid-60s spirit jazz equally potent is falling somewhere between muted and somber it weaves together electro-acoustic manipulation and ghostly chimes that wouldnt sound out of place on the rt ensemble of chicagos early masterworks for the nessa label same can be said of but rather than chimes its flute that supplies much of the tunes haunting flavor contrasting nicely with the aforementioned cuts are playful opener and institutes both of which find billington harnessing the jazzier elements of his style in service of art-rock deconstruction results are cosmically rippling vibrations and trippy ear-play that actually recall vintage dd rundgren (whose two most outr forays into synthesizer-laced pop wizard true star and dd have become quirky cult favorites in the realm of experimental electronic music lately) maybe part of the reason this record is such a refreshing listen is that avant-garde musicians interested in fusing jazz rock and electronics are something of a rare breed these days outside of ben vidas criminally short-lived bird show band ensemble as well as ed wilcox and synthesist charles cohens free-improv duo there simply arent a whole lot of names out there blowing minds in this particular vein but even if the opposite were true would still stand out because the bulk of its charm ultimately rests on billingtons ability to create music that is personal unique and really quite soulful

though some of s soundtrack work from the 90s was recently reissued recorded live at londons corsica studios in october 2012 is their first new material in seventeen years now that the group no longer includes shinichi shimokawa stuart argabright who previously fronted ike yard is s sole member on the title track he pits corrosive textures against feral percussion which exist in huge desolate spaces is located in that sweet spot where techno post-punk and industrial intersect with rapid-fire drums and billowing drones on city tokyo a sour rain drips over massive bass as creepy vocal samples and ambient recordings appear and decay into pits of reverb predictably this live recording trades the originals ambient noodlings for a more sharply focused approach is even more spartan consisting of little more than trebly drones and a pummelling beat is unashamedly cinematic relentless and evocative if perhaps lacking in diversity of mood still that weakness is no doubt the upshot of being a live recording and nevertheless augurs well for a rumoured album
a string of crunching full-fat eps have marked out as a pair of fine house music practitioners what ep features three of the tracks on the dutch duos forthcoming album boxed out providing more evidence of their winning vision for what works on global dance floors title track is classic swindle: rolling percussion and frenzied stabs straight out of the kenny dope playbook chattering hi-hats and resonant electric organ special things happen when the track is handed over to leon vynehall and bassline working here as laszlo ir version is stomping skeletal house with a crashing rhythm thats part african and part well dancehall its propelled by the same boundless energy as the original but with a far rougher texture samples eric b rakim (there are a couple of hip hop-influenced tunes on boxed out ) but its pitched-up tempo organ stabs and breakneck hi-hats are a healthy distance from make em clap to this swindle show their more measured side with the finger-clicking mid-tempo where throbbing analogue synths share a platform with those trademark organs swollen pads and congas

its amazing how long some artists wait before striking out solo according to discogs marius v reid has been around since at least 1997 and yet it was only three years ago that his name first appeared on a record alone like that release was on prins thomas an imprint which could barely be better suited to his carefree sound much to their consternation the label and its friends have invariably been associated with disco over the years with this latest release one can understand their frustration: it doesnt have much to do with disco at all in fact many of the tracks are kind of gaudy almost too polished and thats the worst than can be said about at times its incredibly garish tracks like and brim with flocks of major-key chords at the expense of everything else otherwise as youd expect from an album thats built almost solely on flashy synth lines and arpeggios its a pretty pleasant listen for instance the opening track sounds uncannily similar to little big bees serene scuba with bobbing chords and a sandy shaker it too would make the perfect accompaniment for a dive then theres the pre-released single til sara much more in line with the cosmic atmosphere so often attributed to prins thomas and lindstr m its stately chords sway alongside flanging percussion and rubbery bass coming off as nothing less than transcendent similarly the euphoric vallefarret shows more restraint and is all the better for it the final track is also rather enchanting while parts of it reach the aforementioned levels of corniness the periods of quiet calm and convincing storminess that bookend the track save the day unfortunately for v reid however theres just not enough of these moments on for it to make a lasting impression as a whole
crowdpleaser st plomb have nailed it perhaps their title is a cheeky claim to the title may well be the year of well i dont want to get ahead of myself its only april after all and my other hunch is that is the year techno mastered the artist-album if recent and forthcoming works are anything to go by but i do get the feeling that i mightnt be the only person pencilling in this slinky rumpy lil microverse into my top ten list ask me again in december slips in between a lot of things serving up a heterotopia sanded smooth by impressively artisanal sound design and keenly spaced and placed movements the whole work glides with the effortlessness of a well considered mix where what you might assume would be incongruous incompatibilities get friendly grow asses and get the urge to shake them together its a smooth mover but not frictionless seems to point out that the super-slippery soundspace of a lot of minimal music is not so much a fasterfaster future as a grey space where a certain kind of nothing keeps happening over and over again in place of grey wastes we have taste with waist a stuffed sack of influences: on zukunft you can hear shades of mr oizo green velvets leave my body and robags earlier more whimsical workouts for musik krause today moves further into a straight techno vein again with shades of velvet and perhaps a dash of kozes (anti)climactic tactics it gets tense it gets intense and often doesn t release before moving on pulling it off by leaving it hard if you dig my favourite tracks though wouold have to be the mesmeric ambient pieces that bookend the album early with its gliding synth scales and the finisher last which is so much the shoegazer sigh-trance atmosphere nathan fake tried and failed to conjure on drowning in a sea of love its a blissout which works perfectly alongside the panultimate track 123 that begs to be played loud and proud to a dance floor in the process of losing their shit instead of just re-presenting their influences with updated sound design theyve sublimated them and they come back as ghosts in the machine the many shades of cajual but equally maurizio koze lil louis whole chunks of the electro-micro-minimal continuum in each case crowdpleaser and st plomb have managed to own all they evoke while it s hardly the-masterpiece-we ll-still-be-catching-up-on-in-five-years a la we are monster there s an artful neatness to the complete work it all fits beautifully: its funky fun and functional crowdpleasing with aplomb
cat : fst014 side a: ultimo respiro - trance generators mix possibly the best tune ive heard this year played as my opening track after john kelly at dance academy (plymouth england) and to say it brought the crowd to life is an understatement starts off with the vocal of someone breathing and the sound of a life support machine beeep beeep slowly the beats get further and further apart as the breathing gets slower then beeeeeeeeeeep beep beep bang bang bang a bassline to send even the hardest of hard trance lovers into a fearful state keeps along those lines until it hits the break where we get a really nice trancy breakdown with a euphoric feel along with a very catchy riff leaving the break the tune explodes into a bassline so hard it could send amplifies flying into the air ever since the first time i played this tune everyone has been asking about it a must buy record side b: giu la testa on the other side we have giu la testa two mixes first off the atomic alliance mix which kicks off with a funky riff featuring bongo drums the tune quickly changes pace and takes you into a nice riff with bassline to match the break contains something of a happy hardcore style happy tune and it keeps this feel as it leaves the break until later in the track where it reverts back to its original hard edge the next mix is the radio edit a shorter version of the atomic mix mainly keeping the happy hardcore style riff theres something on this record for everyone
s second long player temporary pleasure is deservingly touted as a pop album: almost all tracks feature a guest vocalist and most them are built around a traditional radio-friendly four-minute structure furthermore both james shaw and james ford have co-production/co-writing credits for artists as varied as little boots florence machine and arctic monkeys in which says a lot about both their adaptability and understanding the format if there was a band set to deliver a shiny gem-like myriad electro-pop album this fall its them but as the very title this album suggests pop music is about the thrill the contemporary the excitement being here and now and the risk becoming evanescent and quickly obsolete and this is something temporary pleasure fights with on more than just some occasions current single (with the clever and sassy help yeasayer) and youtube-approved semi-hit cant (er what ) both showcase a bouncy beat and a crisp synthetic melody the former destined for early evening airplay and the latter for peak-time elation struggle between pop immediacy and electronic inventiveness that smd couldnt be more apparent and were are barely three tracks in upfront pop tracks work best though and there a plenty them: with the ever-engaging th showing up in subtle quieter mode then on her work with gossip delivers a slice present-day disco that is heavily indebted to donna summer (and all the better for it) while the featuring the vocal antics the debonair is a cool slice moroderesque effects and tricks even better are synthesize a huge dance cut that samples todd rundgrens 1975 oddity born to synthesize and turns it into a weird tribal-like anthem that is both joyful and exuberant and a brief moment contemplative electro-pop given over to hot chips this versatile parti pris unfortunately doesnt always work for instance the featuring newcomer trio is an awkward take on dizzee rascal-esque populist grime while the brooklyn-based trio cant do anything to salvage album-closer from feeling like mere last-minute filler those looking for the kind sleep deprivation -like dance floor-oriented side the duos music should hunt down the limited edition cd version the album that comes with a second disc it includes instrumentals like flea in your ear are you in the picture and babaghanoush which have a mind a machine -era carl craig vibe it says a lot about the incredible talent that shaw and ford posses instead having to produce with guest vocalists around the self-imposed pop ethos cd1 gives way to 30 minutes complex techno d excursions that have the same visceral impact as a smd live performance that both smd members have become in-demand producers and remixers over the past few years tells you something about their studio flair and mastery the pop-with-indie-credibility genre but until they find a way to reconcile their inherent struggles and morph them into some sort overarching synthesis in their own music fans will be left both satisfied but also at times confused temporary pleasures indeed
with its last two releases eps from dj guy and bluntman deejay glasgow label has moved from functional club bangers into more pensive territory their newest release from unknown entity is a precision strike in the middle -in-surface- is named for a hovercraft-like vehicle that flies close to the surface and the ep lives up to its title its got a lightweight feel as if it were made of titanium built on a bassy rhythm track that coughs like a rickety engine is a turbulent voyage through fistpump-worthy chord progressions and sheets of staccato synth the more peaceful rides slow-motion bass stabs like thermal updrafts keeping aloft with a beautifully fluid sense of motion chugging along with just a tick-tock snare-and-hat combo its sparse begging for something harder to slot in underneath it (even just a kick drum would do ) the brightly lit melody could easily be the solar eclipse in a pitch-black techno set the eps brief bookends mile out and have the same almost-but-not-quite-there feeling about them and its tempting to imagine how strong -in-surface- could have been were it more fleshed out as it is its a slight but impressive teaser for more material from
delusions of grandeurs rich vein of form shows no sign of abating with its latest release from berlin duo label run by perennial deep-house zealot jimpster has forged an esteemed reputation for itself in the last year following a series of sterling releases from the likes of revenge roberto rodriguez and tuccillo with warmth soul and calibre seemingly the binding threads of continuity picking up the baton are hauke freer and matthias reiling who belong to the same creative milieu that spawned current rising star hunee and on this evidence appear just as comfortable in the sort of disco halfway-house that has provided such a fitting abode for their contemporary in the slice-and-dice approach to sampling recalls sound streams best work with spasmodic stabs and curtailed strings punctuating an engine-like chug from the drums at once stylish and effective it is as robust a house record as you will hear all year it sets a high standard and one which readily lives up to a piano-roll that is merely hinted at searing hats and intermittent periods of blissful modulation are the select tools that issue this more conspicuously disco number with its abundant funk with such positive impressions confirmed it is of relative insignificance that the third track fails to match the pace and execution of the previous two while not a thankless exercise it meanders rather than builds and ultimately derives little inspiration nonetheless have delivered a release of unequivocal quality for a label that manifestly demands it
it s a bit of a surprise to find s name on the tin of a release hers is a name usually associated with relentless pummeling techno but unlike her previous releases on (ahem) relentless her effort for james holden won t be pleasing the boisterous tub-thumping crowd instead mistress barbara turns the tables with two cuts of spaced out rhythm claps and melody more with euphoria on their mind than bludgeoning clubbers into submission the title track is particularly serene: hypnotizing bells gushing piano keys broken snares and synths fuse together warmly to create the kind of emotional human techno we ve come to expect from border on the b is slow-paced and quivering composed of tenuous basslines and subtle bells it s purpose built as a b-side and many will find this cut a little monotonous sadly elsewhere label boss james holden offers two dub versions of : dub is a delicate piece filled with bleeps distorted bass and broken high hats that recalls aphex twin and boards of canada while tool is a broken down affair of noisy distortion and synths which should do enough to confuse but is a well-made cut nonetheless s trademark sound is all over this release but who knows whether mistress barbara s fans will follow like previous releases on the label outsmarts the pack and leaves a sweet aftertaste you re in for a treat
as their recent placing in ras top 20 labels of would suggest munich imprint have gained themselves a captivated audience t would be difficult to dispute their credentials last year alone saw the release of swedish starlet sally shapiros my guilty pleasure the impressively deep pocketed selected label works 1 compilation and the anthemic reckless (with your ) 12 inch new canadian talent azari and as if to further brandish their knack for ticking multiple boxes we now have to contend with a ten track unmixed selection of blossoming production names with a couple of cuts licensed elsewhere thrown in for good measure although the word house appearing in its title would appear to give a conspicuous nod towards its stylistic course f this is more of a tip toe across the peripheries of the genre take album opener by uk duo for example: ts gradually uncurling filter and pitter pattern percussion camps the track out in a lost city somewhere between early new york and chicago yet somehow smacks of contemporary european disco at the same time graeme clark aka revenge has been positioning himself as one of the flag bearers for this type of creeping four four approach in recent months and appears here along with craig smith under their edits obsessed cloak rides its source sample all the way into the sunset by expertly coaxing an emotive glow a single gently repeated phrase first 40 of f this which also takes in the duck and pump field gets stoned goodness of s and the busy beaver bass of leaps one stepping stone of quality to another but a slightly uninspired mid section allows things to stumble into the stream belgian pair are able only to tentatively imprint a groove upon t coy ; wears his old school influences a little too overtly on his sleeve for ; and from obviously it did serious damage over the summer of 09 but inevitably feels a little worn down at this stage in the proceedings breakthrough berlin based force unfortunately cant match his efforts for w t and retreat on standin either which leaves it up to and to do a spot of day saving former gets to work on s hook laden which originally saw the light of day on compost last year while the latter shows why talk of his latent talent is indeed justified thanks to the wonderfully oddball despite its occasionally flat passages f this continues to prop up s esteemed reputation as purveyors of high grade house and disco hell if youre tackling the thing digitally simply pick and choose your favourites no need for any refunds here
its not many compilation series that become so successful they have to do a best of but thats exactly whats happened with the excellent pulp fusion series a mixture of soul rare groovy funky jazz and breaks to celebrate this round-up of the previous seven releases dj pogo contributes a scratched-up mix of the classics often the scratching enhances the originals say for instance boris gardiners melting pot and the johnny otis shows the watts breakaway among the other excellent groovers are dizzy gillespies matrix a piano led bass section complemented by subtle horns and the harlem underground bands groundbreaking smokin cheeba cheeba - we all know what thats about my personal favourite here is ahmad jamals misdemeanour previously un-pulped and very lounge - the sort of thing those thievery corporation chaps would lap up with its spacey strings the copious booklet notes are worth a read - just how many tracks are influenced by graham central stations the jam the second unmixed cd is essentially the first minus the mixing but also features the likes of mandrill funkadelic and the brazilian quartet azymuth if youre a soul or hip hop aficionado this is about as good as it gets and a fitting testament to a series that just seems to be getting stronger and stronger
title of ustralian sound artist s new album is taken from a 2011 book by lauren berlant to berlant cruel optimism is when something you desire is actually an obstacle to your flourishing specifically when people dream of prosperity and security in societies that can no longer provide them englishs choice of title is also apt in the current climate: when reality threatens so much turmoil and suffering optimism though surely necessary for survival can seem oddly cruel se ideas are reflected in in which english uses layers of drone to convey texture and meaning fter years of making music mostly on his own english has invited a long list of collaborators including swans guitarist norman westberg percussionist thor harris pianist chris brahams and drummer tony buck result is an album that feels personal but also universal part of that universality comes from english s patience the way for example he lets tones and timbres endure some tracks on feel blunt and angry take the crashing abrasive blasts in but no track on can be reduced to just one point of view englishs harsher moments still contain sunlight and his calmer passages still course with tension his production is tactile and echo-drenched making everything both immediate and distant s the album progresses eeriness takes over tracks such as and sound ghostly and detached but in closing with the majestic reverberations of english suggests theres room for optimism the pure uncruel kind in his music
how much mileage can you get out of three chords and a couple of low toms in the case of eamon harkin and steve eauff raney quite a lot the lead track off the duos second ep for throne of blood is the very picture of simplicity with a pattering drum machine groove threaded through a minor-key chord progression what makes it work is the way two sets of chords circle each other warily striking an understated tension that blows as wide as the horizon through a big set of speakers that uneasy relationship between the synths is only magnified by the bookending vocals catching the listeners in a vice between full-throated baritone and a steam-whistle falsetto response is less dramatic and if anything its even simpler essentially a two-chord affair although careful filtering and voicing keep it from feeling static and breezy 909 snares give it plenty of punch moody deep house in a kms vein it ticks all the right boxes including unusually skillful eqing and sound design naum (optimos jonny wilkes and james savage) carve out a percussive foundation and downsample the synths sparking queasy bitcrushed harmonics and a glittery stomp reminiscent of classic kompakt and speicher records
the title of dj spiders latest series offers a hint as to his working method the new york eccentric takes house and techno and tinkers with their dna creating hybrids of unusual viciousness in his work with franklin de costa the latest in a long line of collaborators including hakim murphy and marshallito his chosen genome appears to be peak-time functional techno on this second set of genetically modified tracks the basslines are gaunt and the percussion well-muscled but the grooves have a maniacal swing as if a few molecules of new york house found their way into the lab is packed with character and mischief in spite of its simple construction s b-movie vocal ominously declaring it came without warning further amplifies the sense of cartoonish dread meanwhile suggests that spider and de costa take their studio time-outs in a new york sewer over a restless broken-beat groove its grotty synths rattle and echo through an enormous dank space its a welcome change of tone even if spiders experiments have yielded better results elsewhere
if 2009 was the year that adam xs alias gained kudos among technos underground with a few shouts of support from dubstep djs thrown in along the way then could mark the projects transition to big-room popularity chris liebings label has picked up the ep series for re-release and in a move that accentuates the imprints kingmaker role it has commissioned a series of well-known remixers to provide new interpretations most importantly though the re-releases should serve as a reminder of why the series won such acclaim the original version of is as claustrophobically brilliant as its title suggests with a muffled rumbling bassline gradually dominating the listening spectrum accompanied by reverberating drum patterns transcends the space between our world and a parallel universe; this is thanks in no small part to the use of eerie suburban knight-style beats there is a similarity to the sheer otherworldliness of the groove but also the sleek and somewhat merciless sheets of metallic percussion unsurprisingly the zwischenwelt that documents is not a happy place and the blast of hardcore-inspired riffing would put even the most seasoned techno traveler on notice if you havent heard this record before buy it and listen to it on your own in a dark room for maximum effect fresh from reworking samuli kemppi and dario zenker peter delivers a totally different version of looking to the dense shuffling drums of klock and the metallic stepping rhythms of recent frozen border output delivers a functional version that nonetheless boasts a distinct identity thanks to a dank tweaked acid line however it sounds positively polite what wouldnt when played next to marcel s take on continuing the brutalist theme he began on apron but shifting radically to capture the high-speed intensity of luke slaters xtront releases the squelchy liquid bass is tethered to breeze block percussive jolts and a headlong galloping tempo a malevolent combination that will level a packed festival tent at 100 paces
londons likes to back up his playful uk techno with big ideas just look at this years sprawling opti-sonic project primitives in the same spirit a url on the centre label of his latest record takes you to a generative artwork inspired by john conways game of life its erratic blossoming shapes mimic the way cells reproduce; the point is to illustrate the process of emergence by which complex patterns arise from interactions between simple elements these two tracks the first in the three-part emergence series on s own label reflect this idea perfectly the producers hybrid music which balances uk garages sugary hooks with technos raw muscle has rarely sounded so simple and direct yet its also more fluid than ever centres on the deft sparring match between its sledgehammer kicks and viscous synth chords the odd barrage of claps evokes kowtons grime-like constructions but in s hands the results are hypnotic rather than brutal works with near-identical elements but its more fractured its groove constantly teetering on the edge of collapse holds his nerve though and constructs something borderline delirious before pulling it apart in the breakdown

we do not live in a heroic age of dance music in our scene s grand historical narrative disco s language of sexual freedom and hedonistic release was dance music s year e but it was black and gay chicago house which with its yearning spirituality and pervy druggy novelty gave dance its cultural force leading us into the sci-fi fantasies of techno and drum n bass and then onward to trance s dayglo hippie psychedelia recently electroclash s euro-sleazy decadence and jaded fashionability have revived the old myths but the neon glow has since faded and we re left with what we don t have new stories to tell new seductive promises to make or new fantasylands to conjure in dank basements or huge festival arenas some people agonise over this and come up with convoluted aesthetic and technical arguments about what dance music now means but the reality is much simpler s something we all know intuitively: this music is to dance to but dancing is a simple word and a simple act that conceals vast crystalline caves of meaning and experience this music is the music that disconnects the brain from the equation where sound leads directly to action and movement the fierce joy of the experience comes from the detachment of watching your body react in ways that you re not completely controlling movement happens and you re not sure where it came from you can dance to other forms of music but only dance music fully immerses you in dancing alone and nothing but dancing the point of lifting an artist above the many thousands making these records all across the globe is to show who can most effectively plug their quarter-inch jack directly into your motor centres and make you move in ways that you didn t think you would or could the trick is not in inventing new rhythms or new sounds or writing deep lyrics unless those things are in service to that eternal kinetic experience this is what we mean by talent have talent in the best of their songs every chime every bleep every tick and every thump can be directly expressed through movement i m not sure if someone who has never lost themselves on the dancefloor and experienced that abandon could ever see that in this music but it s there in its every fibre listen closely to the way that every sound that is added to can directly translate into a physical act and the complex beauty underlying what otherwise seems a very simple track becomes obvious or feel the way that the gloriously unusual synth sounds on directly connect to the beats not just sitting over them but integrated together in a flowing whole there s also the way that the fast undulating jiggle in the main line substitutes for what might be hi-hats on a less imaginative productions giving that shoulder-shaking feel that prompts the most creative dancing there are gentler moments here too like the sleepy euphoria of but i feel that it s in the fiercer grooves that this album really excels the drums and effects on and their transcendent single attack you when you re not expecting it and make you want to dance all the harder to catch up this album and this artist exemplify to me why i love dance music and i urge anyone who feels the same to buy this record though those who already follow will need no encouragement the only thing wrong with is perhaps that the sequencing of the tracks is a little odd; the album doesn t feel like it has an overall flow but there are so many great tracks here and we all know how to use the playlist function listen and remember that it s not about hardware software vinyl mp3s uk germany us minimalism or maximalism s about dancing
you know when tracks come up labeled as alternative in itunes or whatever other player you use and you pause to wonder what such a designation rightly or wrongly assigned might even stand to mean at this point a duo from copenhagen is alternative for better and worse the better being an evident lineage with some good old material from the margins of post-punk and beyond the worse being a sort of generic adherence to what sometimes sounds more like a study than a passion project hey has a sound that gets at some of the old garage-rock twang of bands like the cramps and some of the playful new-wave wiggle of the b-52s its a little slight but more than serviceable and it gets better as the beat builds into a carnivalesque disco-rock outro that signals the presence of trentemoller who produced all four tracks here three other songs are more spare and at least ostensibly more haunting on the gets by mostly on acoustic guitar and tambourine mixes some arid twang with strings and galloping percussion into a nod to ennio morricone and goes gauzy enough to call to mind old cowboy junkies each of the tracks is at least fine but the range covered by them all suggests an act that hasnt quite figured out what it wants to do yet trentemoller for his part grows less evident as the material grows more diffuse and the voice of josephine philip has a habit of wandering around in search of a style almost like the footage you sometimes see of the fascinatingly rudderless old pan- alternative band fronted by stefani germanotta before she became lady gaga
straddles a few musical worlds the berlin artist has released star gazing synth epics ( ) intimate solo piano pieces ( screws ) and plenty in between and he does it all pretty well his live show lays bare the sheer scope of his work: hes usually got at least three pianos plus an array of synths and other gadgets these performances often show the true breadth of his talent in a way his individual records cant is here to fix that problem its a welcome compilation of live recordings from the past two years collecting snapshots of him in different moods at different concerts almost 80 minutes we hear everything from climactic synth crescendoes to plaintive whisper quiet ballads in other words is the wide ranging sampler frahm has needed all along s with much of the roster frahms allure is his directness his compositions touch an emotional nerve and his take on modern classical is accessible you dont need a music degree to appreciate it he often dabbles in electronics further emboldening his delicate compositions fter a brief and dubby intro opens with where frahm balances a meek piano figure over a rippling puddle of synth repeating methodically over eight minutes its definitively electronic but after it slips into a searing climax his increasingly frenzied banging on the ivories becomes a key human element meanwhile easily frahms most well known song becomes a 17 minute suite where its chords melt into something more ambient before the composers quick fingers pick out an anxious melody on electric piano that recalls early 70s pink floyd in its blues informed pomp the other half of mostly consists of sparser piano pieces that stand up remarkably well to their showier counterparts the nine minute d a majestic piece that feels like its moving in slow motion nicely showcases his dexterity the /tistana/ mbre suite demonstrates a fantastic grasp of volume texture and dynamics and includes some of frahms most tender playing d which loops and manipulates ambient noise reveals a bit of a musique concr te streak ll of this might be a lot to absorb in one listen but use your imagination and the record flows like one continuous performance is marked by frahms unabashed sentimentality an earnestness that works in his favour more often than not d then theres the matter of the recording: echoing out into yes spaces frahms music takes on an even grander quality these very much sound like live performances and theyre all the better for it short of seeing him in concert is as close as youll get to hearing frahm at his best
one of the great things about d sseldorf is that theres no discernible line between the citys arts and music communities its best club salon des amateurs is located within the walls of the kunsthalle art exhibition hall salons founder detlef weinrich who makes music and djs as tolouse low trax studied at the citys centuries-old kunstakademie which is where he met his two partners in viktoria wehrmeister and jan wagner back in the 90s began when gregor jansen of kunsthalle asked weinrich wehrmeister and wagner to collaborate on a performance at d sseldorfs das fest in 2014 trio played live at the salon as part of the festival with wehrmeister on vocals weinrich on machines and wagner coordinating the visual side of the performance vladimir ivkovic a longtime resident at the salon wasnt at that performance in 2014 but he heard the demos and decided to sign to his label on essen f r alle those rough demos have been cleaned up a little but not too much by gordon pohl another staple of the d sseldorf scene wehrmeisters contribution to the record is remarkable her lyrics are delivered in a mix of rudimentary english spanish and a feverish made-up tongue vickys fantasy language ivkovic calls it that brings to mind anna homlers breadwoman character she sounds like a german anne clark on while on she stretches her words and lets them linger like an early morning prayer for his part weinrichs productions stay true to the kind of slow swinging body music he crafts as tolouse low trax on he creates a huge sluggish groove while his watery loop on is offset by wehrmeisters half-yelled vocal delivery s furious energy returns on a track with echoes of roberto de simones 1976 stomper a salon classic thats had plenty of airings at the club down the years in its own way essen f r alle is a classic salon record too
what is it about remixing tracks apart from the remixers remixing fee (usually a small amount in some cases) most of the credit goes to the original artist some remixes even sound better than the original version s recovery is a track i personally havent had the pleasure of hearing yet after hearing this release it would be interesting to check out what the original has to offer side a pako frederik remix on a more progressive house tip this remix has a nice build up of elements adding in bass synth stabs washes and swirls to good effect the bass drum has a sharp kick (a very stabby sound of bass drum) to it and gets a little bouncy with the addition of a nice bass line even though im not much of a progressive fan it is still an enjoyable mix definitely one to play on a big system and when the dj is building up to a climax side aa suberb n kaos drumnbreaks mix the information sheet says that these 2 producers are drumnbass producers and now theyre trying their hand at producing breakbeats nothing really new about the situation however it leads to some interesting releases being put out (e g dj zincs bingo label aquasky vs masterblaster and others) this one has a nice top end breakbeat sound utilising snares and hi-hat a bit more prominently - like a d b track being slowed down - and also has a very low sounding almost monotonal bassline the name of the remix suits it perfectly this is not a bad remix release however it would be interesting to hear the original yet this release offers something for people who follow either religion of dance music be it 4/4 breaks or drumnbass (in a way)
jacob long has been kicking around the bay a music scene for years after time spent in washington d c notably as the bass player for dischord five-piece eyes that band split in the mid-2000s and reformed in san francisco as dub-punk unit mi ami which served as a launchpad for three different dance projects: longs drummer damon palermos magic touch and singer/guitarst daniel martin-mccormicks ital is the first lp on martin-mccormicks label and the first for spired by the dense fog striking beaches and hilly horizons of san francisco it marks long as a rising talent in the world of dub techno stylistically the music is of a piece with terekkes smudgy sounds most further records acts and opal tapes affiliates like 1991 but longs touch is more immaculate uses harpsichord over an insistent house beat and fluctuating cosmic wind reminiscent of nothing so much as the melodic ends of shinichi atobes brilliant butterfly effect it also proves long to be a dub classicist especially once an elongated melodica lead takes center stage is expertly sequenced if dub techno is loved for its transportive brain-cleansing effects then minute-long intro is like burning sage after entering a room the beatless piece establishes the palette and mood long also waits until the third track to introduce any muscular low-end; hes given you your trance now dance a 14-minute three-track suite looks back to the period when issued ambient cassettes in micro-editions on niche us labels begins with the dull roar of the ocean a calming drone flitting in and out of the mix in stark contrast a slow build introduces and s most straight-ahead deepchord-style productions as a whole the triptych is less developed than the rest as it strays from longs gift for melody closer makes up for this its dueling slo-mo arpeggios and clattering rhythms summon the elegant gloom of burials stolen dog but without field recordings their absence proves long doesnt need them hes fluent in simple washed-out melodic themes that capture the hills beaches and winding streets of san franciscos misty peninsula that knack for texture creates a disorienting lost-in-your-head sensation on allowing it to work as both trippy ambience or immersive dance music its enough to make long look like his citys finest dub techno export since kit clayton

dave huismans had a relatively quiet 2012 the ir jordan ep under the 2562 alias took his sample-based approach into newly conceptual realms while productions as found a home on clone asement series (the banging but comparatively straight-laced rchive ii ) and 50 weapons (a pair of crunchy party starters titled malfunctions ) ut it felt like huismans more radical tendencies were being held in check renders that notion thoroughly obsolete this is without doubt the most unhinged record huismans has put his name to and will likely stand out as one of the most challenging dance floor platters of the year and if you think thats a bold claim to be making in january then you obviously havent heard the thing in a sense weve been waiting for this record for a while its barefaced insanity having been hinted at in past mus material the strange sparse brutalism of 2011s take the plunge ( eat mix) or the tumbledown rhythmic science of malfunction (despair) head in particular feels like the answer to a question that has long been on huismans lips: namely where is the boundary between swing and disaster theres a groove sure mucky kick drums and splintered shards of hi-hat fall onto an approximate grid but huismans tears gaping holes in it yawning silences occasionally filled with frantic double-time snare drills is fractionally kinder to djs its yammering synth line and stuttering beat repeat-style edits recalling mmm at their raviest still the same incessant stop-start dynamism is at work a gleeful refusal of dance floor fulfillment that only a veteran like huismans could pull off in the closing minutes were dropped abruptly into a straight-ahead techno banger it feels well earned

has always been a favourite of electronic fans djs especially but their work has rarely been floor-oriented relying instead on remixers to help them along bpitch seems like a perfect home for the now-solo project of joshua eustis here four producers step up with takes on each with dancing more or less on the agenda thomas keeps telefons signature downcast vibe but his throbbing beat is surrounded by too many whirring parts to ever take off completely despite offering plenty of ear candy for the home listener miss meanwhile summons a trademark off-kilter groove that queasily worms its way into your brain in the same insidious way as the originals woodwinds its ben s lacerating techno take though thats the obvious hit its jacking techno beat clears a path for itself and then uses a gnarled voice loop to make even more itd be the typically berghain raw techno business except for the whipping swirls of melody flitting around in the back adding an almost imperceptible depth to this visceral remake on digital duties sasha who provides the simplest version of the four he finds a way to make a chant out of the vocals and simply dusts the thing with glaciers of synths and an enormous house beat its got nothing on but stands alongside the other two as respectable floor fodder
s latest album is their third full length lp and continues with their fascination of marrying drumnbass beats with hard rock elements - distorted guitars rock riffs smashing cymbals and loud shouting vocals all bursting through the speakers at a mere 168 bpm minimum is as described by evan short - one half of - half a collection of 12 s that theyve released and the other half a collection of album only tracks morning light is first off the mark and has been released by classic drumnbass label timeless which is home to producers like goldie an eerie bassline accompanied by a lazy hi-hat introduces the track before the male vocals and dark bass drops kick in thrusting the tune into supersonic mode its been included in crazes live in puerto rico mix cd towards the end to bring his mix to a climax tonite continues on the same dark and mysterious feel this time replacing the male vocals with a whispery female vocal while it attempts to burst ear drums and rumble bassbins with its tear out bassline influenced by a slayer tune of the same name is raining blood featuring a guitar riff played by evan and is one for the heavily tattooed mullet haired ripped tight jean donning drumnmetal freaks out there raining blood has a real mediterranean feel to it with its pentatonic scale melody and in true 80s heavy metal style rip out a lighter raising guitar solo in the middle drumnbass is one style that embraces the efforts of the mc as the crowd mover and hype starter and is one group that showcases the rhyming styles of the local nz talent scribe has just become one of nzs biggest mcs and features on get ready - a guaranteed party rocker with a little reprazent feel to it (when they released their in the mode lp) tiki taane of salmonella dub is described by evan short as nzs choice for mcs in regards to drumnbass and he gets really aggressive on dont tell me like listening to linkin park lyrics on a drumnbass track - pent up teen angst and aggression being released on a hard banging tune dont tell me has a slow 2 minute buildup before the beats and bass kick in and from there its a rollercoaster ride featuring massive rewinds and bass drops heavyweight drumnbass djs like andy c have championed various tracks including ninja for his latest drumnbass arena mix cd - more big basslines rolling breaks with a dark and ominous feel basically continues the dark theme throughout the whole album with tracks like horror show featuring the use of a theremin to give that horrow show feel let it go is probably the only exception as it feels a little less dark thanks to the female vocalist overall is a well produced album however a few too many of the tracks give off the same feel and energy - perfect for drumnbass heads who cant get enough of that adrenaline charged 160 bpm plus rush personally though drumnbass works better for me in a mixed format than it does in album format

if one were going to be cruel about minimal as a style and it s inevitable that some people would want to be one might characterize it as music that strives to be so boring 90 of the time that the other 10 of relatively mediocre drama seems thrilling by contrast to do this is of course to miss the point minimal is pretty boring to sit and listen to in a non-club situation but the music s intricacies come alive in a way that is almost magical if you re actually dancing to it but it does cut right to the core of the dilemma faced by a dj making a mix cd do you showcase what you really do in a club or do you cater to the living room environment your cd will actually be played in the former approach (lets call it beyerism ) can be repetitive and offputting and the latter ( smagghadoccio ) upsets the purists and diehard fans it s not a dilemma that is successfully resolved by the majority of this year s minimal mixes which really have been fairly boring and fail to capture what makes the music exciting this mix is the first release from dance music s current xanadu berlin s panoramabar so you already know which way they re going to jump ideological purity all the way and that purity of vision expressed here by panoramabar resident has produced a hugely evocative document of just why so many of us want to go hear a dj play one record after another for hours on end many people will hate this cd for the exact reasons i love it i love the fact that brings in each track loud and early the way you would in a club there are no subtle transitions here each new track is clearly signaled and it s thrilling to hear for example the tripled snares of villalobos sieso snapping in rough and ready and ever so slightly out of time it makes me want to hop straight on a plane to berlin (even more than is normally the case) what the mix as a whole most evokes is the spirit of acid house and not just because the cowbell from s own toyah could have come straight out of a dj pierre production from 1987 it s stripped back it s raw and it s uneven and that s what gives it such energy as an interpretation of minimalism it s the polar opposite of hawtin s otaku fussiness and finally as a mix it also pulls together many of the divergent strands of house music that have rarely been bedfellows since the days of acid (and kids that doesn t mean the liberators okay ) early on there s lots of lithe sexy garage rhythms such as melchior s self-explanatory let s go deep and in particular the second track believe by d jensen (norm talley remix) a brilliantly leftfield choice for this cd and this audience that reveals the unspoken link between the current steely german minimalism and 90s new jersey divas as the mix progresses the rhythms get more linear and driving with the key point of change being the gorgeous detroit classicism of mono junk s channel b jammed in abruptly in a way that you instantly associate with a sudden change of energy on a small packed dancefloor the beginning of a run of tracks with driving offbeat hats dbx s city on the edge of forever evokes a more paranoid energy a theme developed a little less successfully by the next few tracks until the perky polyrhythmic minimalism of matthias kaden s pentaton lifts the mood and energy level again this starts a sequence of stunning primetime techno to which the only rational response is to jerk your body as hard as possible and to pray that it never ends in particular redshape s pink dust dust and shed s well done unfortunately end it must and true to the realist approach chooses to do this on an dramatic and sexy note with the dreamy wind-down of her own remix of gluehwuermchen fading into the grinding two-step of dj abstract s touch a perfectly chosen piece of uk garage/dubstep which wins a gold star for eclecticism if you love house right down to its dna you ll love this but probably best not to play it at a dinner party
the latest wave of experimental club music is written in the language of machinery: slamming pistons spring-loaded mechanisms wheezing hydraulics and the gleam of steel and glass virtuous scr the debut album from canadian producer tristan douglas (aka ) takes things a step further its a concept album that roughly tells the story of an ai we hear it come to life learn new movements and start to feel emotions all told through the starts and stutters of club music the concept is illuminating enough to add an extra layer of meaning and loose enough to avoid weighing the music down it results in one of the most distinctive albums in recent memory with some imagination on the part of the listener virtuous scr can tell quite a tale a l i c i a starts off tentatively before the drums lay down the records foundation: harsh nearly random percussive outbursts on our protagonist rises the two-part track has a portentous first section tersely chiming chords shattering glass and a more anxious second half where whirring machinery and panicky drums paint a disorienting picture like the robot is still learning how to move also introduces another basic tenet of virtuous scr though it uses recognizable dance music tropes its hardly dance music sometimes it doesnt feel musical at all rhythms come in sideways and leave just as quickly while shapes change and moods shift suddenly tracks become more idiosyncratic as the ai evolves over the course of the record you get knotty interlocked drum patterns on and bouncy rhythms on emotion and colour starts to seep in with trancey stabs on and wounded melodies on 65 22 202 53 the way douglas uses these familiar devices for narrative purposes is remarkable and the emotional thread running through it all keeps his process from feeling stuffy or detached even when he uses the most obvious sounds like the ha dance stabs on its purely on his terms that track is constantly morphing growing more unhinged until it sounds like a nightmarish version of lotics heterocetera on one of the albums more tender moments douglas throws in the saccharine jingle of a canadian phone company to underline the lullaby-ish feel the koodo sample is just part of the depth in virtuous scr on one hand its a funny easter egg that should catch the ears of canadian listeners; on the other its a clever example of the albums concept as if the ai were absorbing emotion and sentimentality through advertisements and corporate media you can engage with the idea at whatever level you want and it works virtuous scr is enjoyable without imagining a robot coming to life but with more time theres a whole world of detail to pore over virtuous scr exists in a lineage of producers mixing signifiers from different styles into high-octane hybrids but douglass approach is different where others scribble between the lines of genre he stands somewhere else on his own taking the sounds of dance music without mimicking its form much like the ai that takes in bits and pieces of the world around it to learn virtuous scr absorbs fragments of the club music continuum to grow into something complex and unique
feel like you havent had enough in your life recently since his entry in the dj-kicks series in 2011 danilo plessow has kept a relatively low profile nd its almost certainly lower than adherents to his dust-covered deep house would prefer luckily the a ep s first original material since the dj kicks mix finds plessow picking up right where he left off while not exactly groundbreaking for this guy a sounds especially recharged a pt 1 is almost bursting with thick bass swells and its tart finger snaps sound like they could make the track pop at any moment a pt 2 is a touch more playful trading in toasty deep house pads and a few critical sub-bass pulses recalling s peerless bassline dub of dj sprinkles grand central pt i finds plessow tickling your sweat glands with little more than a simple bassline and an insistent drum kit nd the breakneck keeps things chugging straight through to the runout lets hope plessow keeps up the pace
what is the logo supposed to be exactly a rat in a hazmat suit it looks like something you might see after humans annihilate themselves with nuclear weapons and even the scavengers that remain have to defend against radioactivity you could easily imagine as the sound of the mushroom cloud its a disorienting room-shaker that pushes rattling in-your-face drums and a weird reggae vocal sample underneath skyward synths i mean theres dance floor bombs and theres dance floor bombs: i would advise clubgoers not to look directly into the speakers if someone drops this whoever is they/he/she certainly doesnt like to waste time this is already the second ep for soul mekaniks wonk label which only got up and running last year the other tracks here nicely expand on the sound of without repeating its wagner-sized theatrics taking crispy deepish house and adding a bit more crunchy metallic sheen along with a tinge of post-apocalyptic menace is a deeper more locked-in affair than its face-melting predecessor but maintains an edgy wartime air using a peppy house groove as grounds for a number of tweaky rave-y bugouts that seem to rain down on the track from above like mortar fire a brief synth bleep morphs from a pleasant whistle-like ornament to an air-raid siren completes the eps trajectory from rave monsters to house bounce gone are the synthesizer attacks what remains sounds a bit like crosstown with a slightly more aggressive sound palette and the fx boxes on red alert a dubby work-out full of bang and clatter like misfiring lasers and kitchen utensils hitting the ground
slide guitar its not something you normally associate with drum bass but then again right now drum bass is all about the unknown english duo fracture neptune have always made lush and cinematic drum bass rooted in all sorts of rock music (utilizing slide guitar in the past in fact) a style nicely packaged and exhibited on their compilation retrospect: decade of fracture neptune is the lone new track on the compilation and its a real doozy finding its palpitating heart in the punch-drunk rhythm of offbeat chords and tenacious relentless drums the defining feature of is yes the slide guitar that weaves and winds its way between the drum patterns enrobed in rich reverb the guitar is as effective an emotive device as it is a melodic one occupying the same middle ground between bluesy lamentation and spooky western atmosphere that it does for post-metal bands like earth on the flipside is a collaboration with that feels muted in comparison even if its similarly unconventional rain puts the funk in neurofunk unscrewing those stuck-gear beats and throwing in growling lfo basslines that cut diagonals through the surface of the track leaving it shorn and misshapen when you can do that and still sound functional you know youre doing something right
ray philp recently pointed out an emergent somnambulant streak running through larry mccarthys productions as on his first entry on hemlock the bristolian disregards the fireworks of his previous efforts and dives into the realm of sleep is all insomniac anxiety with a drum that replicates the sound of a heartbeat as felt from inside the skull in the wee hours of the night mccarthy adds a lullaby-like series of keys and lets it bounce around in the headspace but its pretense of calm is disrupted by all manner of small noises reminiscent of how the slightest of irritants keeps one hopelessly awake is the eps most rhythmic track with bandying chirps and thwacks around a hollow beat just as the track appears to be climbing upwards to a peak mccarthy lets the beat stagger to a standstill it then proceeds again the track taking on a sisyphean sense returns us to a cramped darkened bedroom where the heartbeat of the first tune is replaced with a trickling pulse and tones that wiggle at the periphery but those little rips soon widen to reveal a new hole in which to plunge us while it retains its minimal sensibilities grows more hallucinatory by the minute an odd but satisfying conclusion
hearing a track youre deeply familiar with on a dance floor can be thrilling that thrill might be magnified if its a guilty pleasure therein lies the appeal of ejecas project which modernises trance classics and adorns them with pounding drums a few tracks from the project like ejecas version of mauro picottos i feel love on the first -inch or freefalls skydive on number two give me that thrill the same goes for the on 003 a version of sasha and darren emersons scorchio the original is among the most decadent of late-period prog trance classics a ten-minute ride through deliriously happy leads ejeca isolates the best parts and slaps a pile-driving kick drum underneath the result is pure pleasure but not all edits are created equal the future sound of londons papua new guinea is probably better left untouched while joy kitikontis joyenergizer flies too close to the sun with its screechy elastic synth its the kind of track that will make some dancers jump with glee while others flee for the nearest exit but at least its gutsy that leaves orbitals belfast a melody-rich classic that ejeca treats with the right balance of reverence and recklessness
the techno on bas s label tends to follow a well-established blueprint: sleek slamming and orthodox serbian producer milos martinov returns for a second ep on the label with two tracks that tinker with that formula both his contributions are syncopated but not with the kind of slinkiness that makes rhythms sound sexy or inviting rather his jackhammer swing is more like doubling up punches in spite of its roughness is actually sort of lighthearted: beneath the pounding kicks are slithering synths and rave whistles along with scatting vocal samples that give it an excitable momentum its head-banging techno with a playful side theres nothing so fun about where the drum programming is dense and the melody limited to harsh bleeps that fly off like debris from all the mechanical grinding both originals have a lot of personality squeezed into their ironclad bars which the remixes ditch in favor of functionality s rework of is a pitch-perfect techno banger while clouds turn into one of their rickety junkyard techno jams molding the tracks to their own style rather than doing anything enlightening with them

around the beginning of the year released ep on a rich active m lange of 2-steppy skip and vocal cut-up smeary purple synth glide and concrete-hard drums harking back while looking ahead is both the artist and labels follow-up: remixes of with a new title track which it turns out is as crucial as its predecessor isnt anything terribly new under the sun: by now the shimmering languid and other bukem-esque adjectives have made their own mini-tradition within dubstep and house; this track splits their differences with no apparent effort (it would fit right in on hotflushs back and 4th ) that ease applies to the construction of as well it builds to its climax patiently; in fact it probably wont even occur to you until nearly 2 5 minutes in when the vocals break down dub out and build back up that the track was in fact building to a climax at all its nothing ostentatious just a dose of drama to give the unabashed prettiness some heft braiden is on quite a streak and his rework of is hard and full of nice touches i particularly like the klook of the electro-cowbells but its the lesser of equals here real monster is mark of underground resistance whose reworking of recasts it in flashy dry ice: the purple synth washes are directed somewhere a little more classic-ravey or maybe just hands-in-air-anthem-like either way its a joyous piece of work so are the pair of digital bonuses both also remixes of : machinedrum gives it a fizzy-headed juke-gone-early-rave turn tweaking things up in pitch and concentrating eventually on a heavily treated classic-house piano line koreless goes for something a little glitchier but also affecting sending lines like help me and wont feel something without you into old-laptop orbit and letting its decay rate fill in the blank spaces of the sparse arrangement
finally a new release from the stable of dark progressive: records and it s about time after the demise of their distributor the label resurfaces vigorously with echoman s the brainchild of chris scott and anton fielding with vocalist graeme cheb stewart the flip side sees one of their alter ego (mooncat) deliver another quality tribal number there are two mixes here people grab it while you can cos if you don t someone else will the original a-side is a wicked layer of melodic synths over chunky percussion with the trademark that is darkness unfolds as a chunky bass impels around melodic synths to hurl the track into a whirl of harmonic synchronization tribal progressions add to the b-line that constantly builds and builds with lush piano keys the key change adds a layer to the melody that helps to make it feel very dreamy i know that may sound a bit strange how can house music sound dreamy isn t that for trance all i can say is to find this release and to listen to it and you ll understand the original mix is a perfect example of echoman at their best flipside sees a deeper progression into tribal territories to best describe the mooncat mix in one word is heavy the percussion is tweaked much harder and it develops the track into tougher terrain the programming and production is amazing with crisp fxs that s as clear as the nites sky it s fascinating to hear how creepy tribal can be at times; how hypnotic those drum beats and whirling slabs can alter your state of mind very cool smooth no one should expect anything less from echoman or records as mooncat new phunk theory or echoman the lads are the best at what they do i think it s safe to say that has return to show every man and woman that their back on top of the game
org is an mp3 blog that features tracks from the likes of giorgio moroder phil manzanera king sunny de and leo kottke its one of the many out there unconsciously defining the nu balearica that bands like studio mountain of one and eroplane are busy crafting odes to in this burgeoning scene it seems like those who cant make edit and thats exactly what has been doing for the past few years along with his dj partner nitedog in between their frequent parties in and around the los ngeles area this first collaborative release ( put out a solo 12 inch on rvng late last year) is a gem launches itself with sonar pings and a funky bass before adding some piano tinkling to the mix before dropping a vocal sample the best part you can hear the edit if you listen closely right after a moment of chicken scratch guitar follows a similar tack taking a smoothly orchestrated disco track and making it sing again may be the highlight though its a hard edged track with a delayed guitar knifing its way through the mix and an enormous drum track headbanger made out of what sounds like krautrock not bad

starting out with chunky retro-leaning 2-step workouts like 2020 and laika established himself as someone who could mince old styles in complex pastiches that somehow fit in futurist dialogue bass music but when he was scooped up by prominent indie it seemed like something changed: a track like look at stars had all melodic brilliance s best work but 2-step references were replaced by a cleaner more modern palette clean lines con ured chord progressions and midtempo structures by and large thats sound we get on s eponymous debut album theres only a trace garage aes tic that used define his work and while res still a definite skip here its a post-genre apparatus ra r than a continuum-referencing device is a pop album not a dance album all but three tracks have verses chorus lyrics everything instead pasting vocals over busy tracks or forcing melodies in between complex beats does everything he can make his tracks suitable for se vocals ( subtle harmonic layering on is something behold) the choice vocalists is for most part spot-on because all m are pleasant if just slightly generic s perfectly smooth tenor (think a less withdrawn james blake) meshes perfectly with s clean productions ( ) elsewhere vocalists like and little dragons provide a female counterpoint that proves almost equally fitting the latter two give album its most uplifting moments: with s childlike vocal has a grit and texture rarely found elsewhere on courtesy its grubby talkbox bassline s features records catchiest most irresistible chord progression the few instrumental tracks will provide some solace for those not impressed with s explicitly pop direction while hes not going back anything close jamlock its hard deny that tracks like pseudo-elegaic closer or fidgety bloomer are anything less than lovely itd be tempting say that has watered down his sound but in reality he hasnt hes simply found himself in a position where he can move in a lot different directions without it sounding unlike what helped him get re in first place isnt going break down any barriers in obsessively experimental world that it was bir d but its a thoroughly solid listen all way through which is a lot more than his supposed peers could say about ir debut albums
this record has hands-down the strangest press release i ve ever read with some nonsense about frica bordering on dodgy racial territory that i would avoid if i were german but when it comes to techno strange is pretty much always good so we can forgive them for that fter all there is nothing like strangeness and surprise on the dancefloor - that feeling of being blindsided by a track taking a new and unexpected direction matthias kaden doesn t make me spill my drink here but he definitely raises an eyebrow or two the ep is a deliberate step away from the perky stripped-down sound you d expect from this artist and this label towards a swampier dubbier and more layered approach the -side has a world music vibe with a sparse congo-driven groove and lots of echoey delay the long congo runs are great but might be a little too similar to other tracks out there these days on the b-side is a more progressive atmospheric affair with echoey stabs and frican samples that create an ethnic trancey feel it s a decent enough builder but the rhythm is a little too flat to make you want to move your feet to it but the title track is the one to check here uses a simplistic but powerful bassline as it s foundation and then brings in congo rattles and the occasional bar of funky live drumming to create interest - this cuts in like the biting drums from the shadow boxing drum n bass track way back in the day it s very danceable if stopping short of anthemic and certainly different that s a tally of one good peak time track and two more stylistic exercises for earlier or later in the night this release shows that in a post-minimal world is still a label to check on sight and that kaden is an artist with longevity and a lot left to offer i await the next release eagerly
is the first single to come from t kolai s forthcoming debut album teak all eye on uk based chillifunk recordings taha t elroubi and nicolas kolai (aka t kolai) originally crossed paths at washington dc s deep house night at club andalu in 2000 and since then have release a handful of great productions with this their latest display of talents side a t kolai main mix the original mix of by the t kolai is a rather slow yet smooth house number with a hint of tribal sounds it features some great vocal work that is of the south african traditional style that supposedly captures the soul of those that are exposed to it and once the bass gets kicking you really get the full feeling of this track the saxophone tinted sounds together with some blues style guitar work combine to provide some warming bar type music as well as smooth club beats side b facts mix + fragile state mix on the alternate side comes two remixes by fragile state firstly the facts mix which is a much slower chilled deep mix of the original ben and neil of fragile state have done very well in giving this mix such an amazing soothing atmosphere and the second - the fragile state mix - takes a more minimal angle adding some great warm piano sweeping synths sax stabs and utilizes the great vocals (together with some echo effects) to bring the sounds to life this is a rather mellow release that will surely be played in deep funky/cool bars all around the world great for winding down too
graham goodwins busy 2007 is shaping up to make him just as busy in he spread the wealth around to a variety of labels throughout the past year letting mule electronic soma karmarouge and us all in on the fun (he even inaugurated his own octopus imprint last year with two 12-inches as well ) credit that work ethic and the rising reputation of will saul and fin greenalls us with convincing roland ppel to remix goodwins newest goodwin ppel is a busy dude producing alongside christian prommer and peter kruder in voom:voom and remixing anyone and everyone with prommer in fauna flash ppels remix here is just as distinctive as his recent solo works on sonar kollektiv mining goodwins menacing original for every sliver of emotion he finds them but only after a three-minute intro of spinning his wheels and building tension once the distinctive bassline comes in however were off to the races: ppel spends much of the rest of the time gently building up and tearing down everything around it the source material for the epic ppel mix should hardly be regarded as chopped liver ut it shouldnt be bought on the basis of the warm reception of pple tree contains little of the luscious detroit feel of goodwins previous us outing deep cleansing washes of white noise synth ride ominously against percolating melodies unrelenting in their inevitable rise and fall its the 4 a m to ppels 4 p m its simply a choice of what youre looking for to decide which one to play
afrobeat and highlife records from the 70s have been picking up a lot of international attention lately and with good reason aside from the fact that this region and time period have produced a treasure trove of fantastic dance music thats just now hitting stern ears for the first time many of these recordings also offer a timely look back on a form of proto-disco polyrhythmic funk that kept clubs shaking long before tom moulton produced his first extended mix among the labels reissuing this material is samy ben redjeb the imprints head has traveled many times to the continent collecting thousands of rare pressings from regional bands that never garnered the international attention afforded fela kuti or tony allen st year began compiling redjebs extensive finds into lovingly packaged collections that came with highly informative liner notes that introduced an africa that never managed even scant connections to europe african scream contest: raw psychedelic afro sounds from benin togo 70s was the first to hit shelves and it was a revelation of just how much undiscovered greatness is still out there now comes the doun effect a set that focuses entirely on benins -rythmo de cotonou who recorded extensively over a thirteen-year period running from 1970 to 1983 the band blended james browns marathon funk jams with benins potent voodoo heritage which was born in benin and hugely influenced the polyrhythms from the area the doun effect is the first of two envisioned collections for the orchestre though the eventual lume 2 will reprise the groups recordings for albarika store their official label lume 1 collects the numerous rare cuts they amassed between 1972 and 1975 as they secretly recorded for fly-by-night engineers ny of these tracks originally came out in pressings of less than a thousand copies and werent recorded under the most pristine conditions but sound quality doesnt prove to be much of a deterrent here rather what makes this collection so essential is just how good this bunch of musicians could be while recording off-the-cuff jams to help their studio friends make a little extra cash this is fully-formed african soul music rich and diverse influenced in part by james browns african tours but equally by sato a regional poly-rhythmic blend and sakpata a rhythm associated with doun that was used to protect people from smallpox the band is as infectious as it is timeless benin hasnt gotten as much attention as geria in the excavations currently under way by labels like soundway strut and nest jons but the doun effect proves that there is much to be learned from the countrys musical heritage -rythmo de cotonou is every bit as tight and funky as africa 70 or egypt 80 but with its own unique signatures and fans of those groups will no doubt lap up every moment of this deeply fascinating incarnation of early club music
each of s albums has used a vocal sample as a skeleton key on his first full-length 2011s wicker steel 90s britpop figurehead louise wener waxed lyrical about englishness and crap suburban existence album gloomy and mystical reckoned with ali wells own home counties upbringing on rotting sound from 2014s power and glory mike patton explained that his musical ideas started out either as a joke or as something really horrible sure enough the album oscillated between dark comedy and grotesque industrial techno s equivalent appearing partway through the barren techno tundra of cant is a bit less poetic sample is from british pop artist peter blake talking about responses to his collage work: people said whyd you stick the things on why didnt you paint them and when do paint them they say why did you bother to paint them why didnt you stick them on cant win wells loops the quote in the tracks breakdown so that blake is doomed to endlessly get it wrong first by sticking then by painting at some point the kick drum starts up again and the whole thing trudges bleakly on rest of the album follows this depressive cue roiling anger of power and glory has been replaced with deadened drumwork and empty space and the last sparks of dance floor funk have been extinguished wells starting point was the micro politics of personal relationships and in places sounds like a break-up record with grim industrial shades (see featuring a deadpan ) but the last years various political upheavals led wells to turn back to the bigger picture title of will resonate with followers of current british politics compare its cold spartan stomp to the cackling david george from the last album so will (from a relationship or from the eu ) accompanying this wells sound has a distinctive new twist album began life among the salvaged radiophonic workshop gear at stockports eve studios on tracks like and spring reverb tails and smoky clanks try to float free of technos pulse on the likes of where sour piano chords spar with grubby feedback trails they succeed results are fresh and fascinating but rarely offer the aggressive hit you might expect from wells music when they come close as on the manic something seems different dark ecstasy of say power and glory s take body off has been replaced with a pummelling inevitability wells has resisted laboured connections between his music and british politics but his albums have nonetheless paralleled the way things have gone his first album appeared a year after the conservatives took power his second expressed growing anger his latest reflects a post-brexit curdling of the mood n recent weeks a snap election has been called and we may be facing a rout of the british left a hard brexit and decades of economic and social decay wells remorseless new album might be the sound of us marching towards this grim fate unable to turn away
is perhaps best known as a producer of shimmering ambient tracks his 2001 debut album in moll is undoubtedly one of the finest full-lengths kompakt has released helping draw up the blueprint for the label s distinctive ambient sound guentner s regular contributions to the label s annual pop ambient series are all too often standout tracks that repeatedly confirm his mastery over the form these releases on kompakt however only show one side of guenter; on mathias schaffh user s ware label guentner has been exploring poppier tech-house sounds for quite some time releasing five 12 s and a full-length album on his new album his fourth full-length (second for the ware label) guentner continues his tech-house explorations with just a dash of his trademark ambient textures thrown in and comes up with a fine album indeed opener all the time is bright bouncy and buoyant with a merrily skipping bassline a vocal loop a gently sung all the time occasionally surfaces throughout the track acting almost like a chorus during these choruses guentner adds gauzy ambient textures suffusing the track with warmth even though no other vocals are sung all the time feels just like a love song with its mixture of brightness and warmth something about you treads similar ambient house territory and soften edges is bright and bubbly with sparkling melodies and a nice swing to its hips the album isn t afraid to move more directly onto the dancefloor either ziggy kinder s remix of options (a guentner track on an earlier 12 ) shuffles onto the dancefloor with insistent basslines amidst gorgeous chiming melodies the track builds wonderfully over seven minutes and is guaranteed to have a dancefloor shaking its hips back in the days is surprisingly bass-heavy for guentner with his ambient textures noticeably absent yet is a driving track that should get a dancefloor moving swap and on my mind sustain the infectious grooves all the while maintaining a certain softness warmth and gentleness guentner certainly knows how to move it and groove it but never slams the listener with his beats steps off the dancefloor towards the end and slides onto a soft sofa in the chill out room with never want to stop playing that game ten gorgeous minutes of warm echoing ambience underscored by a gentle yet persistent groove the groove anchors the track ensuring it doesn t float away into the ether giving it a vital pulse the cd closer as we lay on the beach moves in similar territory although its beats almost begin to actively nudge the listener back towards the dancefloor again it s worth noting that the cd and lp releases are configured slightly differently the lp takes out soften edges as well as the ambient house closers never want to stop playing that game and as we lay on the beach and replaces them with the more obviously dancefloor friendly vinyl exclusive realize the vinyl also includes the ziggy kinder remix of brickbuilder another dance track the vinyl then is clearly aimed at djs for club use while the cd is primarily designed for toe-tapping yet ever so slightly dreamy home listening effortlessly moving between the sofa and the dancefloor the home and the club is lovely indeed
is a new side project from the london-based outfit nummer that focuses on straight-to-desk hardware jams the duos timing isnt great given how much mediocre music in this style has been released in recent years but just as last years reach ep tackled classic genres electro techno kosmische with flair also has the style and technical finesse to back up its conceit there isnt a huge departure from past nummer productions here mainly its in the high saturation levels and a subtle shift in focus from lush synth waft towards utilitarian drum workouts retains some tenderness in its pads luxurious things that billow loosely over a pressure-cooked house groove and get progressively rowdier; the latters hypnotic churn millsian but for its leisurely pace is a particular treat on the the duo throw caution to the wind pushing the tempo into the mid-130s and sending shards of percussion flying every which way you can practically feel the sweat dripping off the ceiling
arthur was a human musical instrument said david mancuso as relayed in tim lawrences authoritative biography hold to dreams he was a very old spirit he had been around the cosmic circle many times indeed russells music feels like its tapped into some deeper truth extending beyond eras genres and even intellectual registers his abstract cello compositions can sound as personal as a lullaby and his disco smashes feel equally in touch with minimalism buddhist philosophy and the paradise garage it makes russell who died in 1992 one of the most approachable artists to emerge from the downtown manhattan avant-garde scene during the fertile 70s and 80s but hes by no means the eras lightweight; in his own quiet way he towers over it that isnt to say russell didnt make difficult music its possible that no one knew that better than will socolov russells partner at seminal imprint sleeping bag according to lawrence socolov was becoming impatient with russell by the mid-80s though the former understood the latters genius his projects would take ages to finish if russell famously a tinkerer would ever finish them at all rather than refine the scrappy dance sound that had become sleeping bags signature he was wading further out into an esoteric wildly uncommercial style not long before socolov and russell parted ways in 1985 russell gave the label three different test pressings of an album made under his indian pseudonym called but socolov deemed the material too strange for release more than 30 years later a version of has been cobbled together from those test pressings and is finally getting its day on the racks even russell die-hards might be able to stand in socolovs shoes for a moment though finds russell in typically brilliant form its also his most extreme artifact bearing some of the scruffiest disco noisiest soundscapes and loopiest song structures of his career not all of the material will be unfamiliar alternate versions of russell classics fill up much of the record which helps things along a dubby cello whisper from another thought appears here like a drugged version of itself with slippery drums squishy low end and oodles of distortion hes (lets 2) doesnt veer far from walter gibbons famous mix of lets but its looser and punchier and russells cello occasionally bursts through like blood flowing from a gash is actually more straightforward here than weve heard before infused with a kind of rock swagger the song takes on an uncharacteristic menace in between these known tracks we hear russell exploring hazy freeform terrain beset by droning keyboards rattling drum kits and vocal lines echoed and smeared to the edges of intelligibility when russell sings the titular line from youll know exactly what hes talking about russells cello has never growled so fiercely and his voice has rarely boomed so ominously but his horn arrangements and keyboards maintain a certain balance and warmth y come to the rescue many times particularly on a sprawling jam continually pulled to a distorted brink the albums cathartic final track russell finally crosses over letting cellos jangle keyboards swirl and all manner of studio-crafted disorder gush into the mix but when you average out the extremes you still get is a trying record dont dive in here if you havent yet explored this artists output for the thoroughly initiated though shows just how far down russells deep end you can go
tom bioly and benjamin fr hlichs label has occasionally seemed to ride the crest of the zeitgeist they released john talabot and todd terje records just as nu disco and deep house took hold around the turn of the decade and they put out bona fide anthems like tensnakes coma cat and azari iiis reckless (with your love) but the munich label has otherwise followed its own course over the last ten years even when their music has coincided with outside trends like the space oddities compilations with library music it was more like the currents of fashion had rolled into waters where were already dipping their toes considering that theyve long worked with artists like woolfy vs projections probably isnt cashing in on balearic chill outs latest surge in popularity with their new compilation which is dedicated to what they call the more beachy side of the dance floor but if that concept sounds like a clich then so do the chimes breezy synths chanting and flutes in s plenty of other beachy signifiers find their way into s has funk bass and wah wah guitar with the swagger of a man in speedos saberha gens woozy sounds like its stumbling with sunstroke and theres gentle hand percussion in s other producers take a slightly different angle es deep house shuffler sounds like its paddling through outer space the almost subliminal voices blurred into map aches give the track a disconcerting edge setting it apart from sunnier sounds like the infectious piano hook in s is the only artist here whos released original material on rather than calling on their current roster the label called on artists who fit the aesthetic they had in mind no ones really pushing themselves or any boundaries here but that doesnt hamper the allure of their soft focus grooves
message on the back of rory mcpikes new record as reads keep it re l use hardware stay different statement surely rings true of the melbourne artists eclectic releases for forbidden planet and normals welcome not to mention his synthy ambient project rings round saturn but it feels especially central to the off bluff ep though these three tracks share similar sounds and machines no two are the least bit similar in style or execution mcpikes 12-inch spans lush jungle soundscapes gnarled drum machine workouts and cosmic house all carried out with the touch of a producer sticking to what he knows simply by virtue of its influences cant break free of pastiche; chopped drum breaks dayglo pads breathy vocal delay sirens and massive bass drops make it all sound too on the nose yet its nonetheless a fun 11 minutes of 128 bpm rave nostalgia that could add some colorful energy to the right set two b-sides also do well with their varied dance floor milieus rugged blown-out and playful comes off like an anomaly in mcpikes catalog while has the most in common with his previous records that tracks hues of sci-fi mystery and astral splendor drape over its sprightly drum machine bounce for a spellbinding jaunt with its clarity of vision and distinctive arrangement suggests mcpike would do well to narrow his focus somewhat even if he has the chops to spread his music far across sounds and styles

1 south eastern infirmary main 2 south eastern infirmary dub kasey taylor the founder of vapour records is no stranger within the community one of the finest minds that expose the world over to deep subterranean and vividly dark tracks his latest with chris meehan is no different with over 30 releases under the label s belt now there seems to be no stopping them is a wicked production that s a marriage of james holden deep dubby-basslines and lush melodies meets luke chable evil substructure and frenzy anti-climatic grooves a-side belongs to the south eastern infirmary main mix a chunky mammoth of a beast; submerging itself until your gates crash wide open deep layers of lasting impressions build on top of one another to create a mood of suspense and wonder while the iniquitous percussion notes and subtle key changes create a natural high within time the main mix become quite melodic at points without anything sounding closely related to the new age of trance yet expanding the dream of what trance should have become and now is as progressive haunting snares continue its cerebral assault and you find it hard to forsake yourself as you become lost inside the border between enjoying a track and the constant returning to a track is broken as the layer of intensity and hypnotic elements are hard to get away from i feel as though i am being hurled into a bottomless pit an abyss of groovyness b-side sees the even better south eastern infirmary dub sexy is the perfect word to describe this track lush and groovy this demonic track is entirely based on an unbelievable key change that will steal your soul a rippling b-line foreshadows what will appear as the key melody slowly creeps above while smack dab in the middle a sexy female voice whispers the word eternity that evokes the image of just that a vision of an everlasting note playing on and on and on; worth every penny as a stand alone track i have to say both tracks can make you feel happy in a blissful way how the hell did i go for two months without hearing this beauty i m luv in this track and you will too crown programming and production skills from both taylor and meehan that showcases what both men are all about glowing melodies swim across the shore but it s the entire whole that should not be ignored are you a dj got a vinyl turntable like music (particularly the deeper kind) then you must find a copy of this

the artists on tend to have a certain musicality that sets them apart look at shigeto whose live drumming stands out from the rest of his beat scene compatriots or matthew dear a techno producer who croons you could hear this quality in mike greene from the start his debut album kingdoms was unusually smooth and professional for 100 silk the d y outfit that released it greene formerly a keyboardist for la roux was snapped up by ghostly shortly thereafter and the nn rbor label has been tracing his development with eps for their main label and its offshoot spectral sound over those three years greene made his deep house and disco sound as exquisitely polished as possible and by the time he dropped her dream on live t robert johnson last year it seemed like he might be running out of ideas on he finds some new ones by turning to kosmische and space disco the change is most noticeable on the records second track folle which rolls into infinity like a classic lindstr m cut following a bright arpeggio over a six-minute journey this ones got some real driving-into-the-sunset vibes repurposing the melancholy that has pervaded most of greenes work into a dreamier style he channels that into icy talo on and where he adds chirpy sequencers and sleek vocoders (courtesy of jackson) is up there with greenes best tracks impeccably arranged with just enough groove to shimmy along without getting tousled greene finally lets go of that control with an 11-minute piece that slowly disassembles into a flutter of purring synths and careful tones ts easily the most striking few minutes of the album and its exciting to hear greenes greatest gift catchy hooks and synths like satin sheets laid bare without having to hold up the weight of a kick drum t would have made one hell of a closer too but its followed with the bland which feels like a retread by comparison therein lies the albums flaw: amidst the more bold material are boilerplate tracks like or sure the formers breathy vocal samples and ropy bassline are seductive but its nothing we havent heard from greene already the gussied-up politeness that has followed greene throughout his career is still an issue here making the less adventurous material sound slightly anonymous thats why the thick textures on folle stand out so much or why its so exciting when greene lets it all float away on there are more than enough of these moments to make the record worthwhile and even if greene might still have one foot in his comfort zone a step forward
hot diggy music on my front steps; i honestly cant say that ive kept up to date with the ins and outs within the past few years in the genre from euphoric to abrasive the style has manipulated itself into a new genre that i can no longer call as a pity really but i must say that i am surprised to see and hear two of aussies hottest producers taking a stab at some epic sounds on a remix that looks like a festival goers wet dream so i say take the first pill by for a normal dose or take the second pill for a more intense experience by and luke chable on -3 up first is steves original and the boy certainly is showing his knack at uplifting melodies a very bt-iesqe vibe as you listen with the melody arrangement but with a van dyk attitude horns blowing bass kicking and a simple melody rolling it all puts you back during the 90s nothing innovating but its still heartwarming at points to hear young producers still trying to relive past memories that have faded into obliquity it keeps a bit of mays signature sound of deep bass and rumbling snares ala open day with the melody teasing throughout never really blowing up for good measure instead he and chable will do that with the flip chable and mays blind at 43 and still rocking mix is much more uplifting than the original nice name for a remix as told by may himself through his site off the bat its chunkier beefier and wilder as it adds that chable sound that just rocks unfortunately as much of a bouncing wave it brings maybe it wasnt such a good idea for chable to take such command on the remix getting a bit too comfortable with his own sound its almost like cloud cuckoo part ten of a luke chable mix both are done the same its not even apparent that may had much impact on the remix and it sounds as though it was completely a chable working take account that young producers need to strive to find their own identify it may not have been beneficial to just have one remix a second one by may would have helped established himself away from chable sure theres nothing new or interesting about this release nor does it really show off the production skills of may but this is dance music and the main goal is to get people off their buns and onto the dancefloor and this sounds like it will
over the course of his 20-plus-year career ed upton aka has maintained a high calibre in his signature electro sound the three-part synth funk series for london label is a stellar example stacked against recent efforts on klasse and last known trajectory tha is the third synth funk installment and a bit of light relief switching from heavier material to funk- and jazz-inspired sounds the ep shows upton at his most playful with a collection of tracks that unabashedly avoid all inklings of seriousness downtempo cuts and are both pleasant experiments with old-school disco synths at a higher pace is with its bristly ghetto breaks lifted by a buoyant electro riff the most gratifying moments are in the weird space invaders -style samples of and especially the dance floor-ready in which sombre chords and a 4/4 beat give way to groovy acid and flutes only b-side cut is lacking as overblown synths make it overly theatrical at points
in the year s was released dance music was in the charts as much as the clubs crossover acts like prodigy chemical brothers and leftfield took their cues from the rave scene but were accessible enough for rock oriented crowds and drive time audiences drum bass however was more mysterious likes of origin s valley shadows crept beyond the underground (i recall hearing it alongside tawdry indie demos and britpop on bbc 1s evening session) but it was only in 1995 when the broadcaster launched a friday night show e in jungle that the scenes music was exposed to those like me who were too young to be truly plugged into club culture to a clueless ten year old e in jungle sounded like an alien language transmitting to a clandestine following who presumably understood what this wild strange music was about seemed to mark a drastic change was heavily promoted and won the prize goldies timeless released two years prior achieved widespread acclaim and ltj bukems 1996 lp logical progression was also a hit but neither broke through like did was the first id heard of the bristol drum bass project and it no doubt served as many listeners gateway into the world of prazent krust suv cycle cords v cordings and the wider world of drum bass that lay beyond with hindsight its easy to understand how devout junglists mightve sneered at the records all conquering success and broad sound palette but it remains a landmark of atmosphere mood and ingenuity tracks like and had obvious appeal with ear catching jazzy keys and double bass licks a prominent sound across the lp but the stranger cuts were the ones that offered a window into a different musical paradigm sheer space on for instance was a revelation bahamadias dextrous pivot between cool and deadly mc flow and delicate soul singing felt suspended in thin air over a brittle break and ominous double bass lick icy futuristic atmospherics of the tracks first half contrasted sharply with the cosy familiarity of the sunkissed chords that came later overall though its a creepy album opens with a chilling sample from the 1970 film beyond valley dolls before the arrival of boom bap drums and a devastating bassline this moodiness though was offset with warmth and beauty allees move on move on / the mainstream refrain during shines through layers of alien texture the lps many standouts leaps furthest from breakbeat conventions with dazzling drum acrobatics which vaults around globules of bass and hi tech synth abstraction has a low slung funk groove to die for and ends the lp on a breezy note thanks to a stunning sample of everything but girls each every e is a masterpiece with a beautiful problem when you strike upon something so vital what the hell do you do afterwards a two disc edition released in the same year included several b side tracks but s next album 2000s in mode and a solo outing from touching courted a less subtle jump up style was a general trend in drum bass seen in artists like dillinja whose deft mid 90s material gave way to brutish basslines and streamlined beats at the turn of the millennium n came s 2 an ill advised attempt to rehash the original with as put it at the time a new coat of armour s original two discs have been remastered for its latest edition while the third disc adds genuine value to the release s mostly made up of remixes of tracks made when first came out rigid focus after the drop on the origin remix of is a consummate club ready streamlining of the original krusts heads down bass rub on is a clear precursor to the wobblier basslines that were just around the corner all the remixes though two truly stand out: photeks smooth but sinister approach on and the twists and turns of grooveriders of se tracks offer some context to the stylistic shifts between jungle and drum bass that were taking place 20 years ago same cant be said for the fourth disc which would feel extraneous whatever the content s a live hardware mix chopping various slices of era material and some revisions that suffers from the same issues as 2 where a brasher modern sound and excessive new elements diluted the potency of the original material re are some awkward transitions between familiar tracks and some questionable inclusions such as the garish new track still the past 20 years hasnt dimmed the brilliance of the original lp additional remixes are welcome and the remastering has done these vintage tracks no harm when it comes to trying new things creatively with such classic material though it might be best to let lie once and for all

guillaume coutu dumonts ethnic samples are his trademark but his ability to charm with them that has set him apart from the main body of deep house over the last few years tracks on may not do this as much as the best of his back catalogue (the monologue on the is a case in point) but their forthrightness and less obvious touches ensure that theyre far from drab juxtaposition between the powerful rolling of the drums and the blissed-out pads on the title track is nicely balanced but theres just a bit more weight on the pads than you might usually hear giving an effect of comfortable pressure bongo solo towards the end meanwhile isnt worthy of that cringe you probably just had reading about it stringapella is what youd expect but worthy of mention its rhythmic edges and harmonic shifts suggest possibilities for being layered over other material and key-controlled youre the is headier but it finds a groove with a hammond organ washed out vocals and an inventive springy bass motif and runs with it lthough they may not be as out there as weve heard from guillaume before its hard not to see these tracks holding clout
with artists like patrice scott rick wade and bodycode releasing on yore label owner andy vaz should be commended for signing an unknown artist to his high-caliber roster lets hope that vazs adventurous a ring pays off because if it is to be judged on quality alone and in isolation from the name game will be a sure-fire winner inspired by classic us house and techno with a few nods to european variants this release is so accomplished and assured that its hard to believe its the producers debut starts with an assured opener with jacking to the sound of a resonating chicago bassline on the other hand lets sees the producer explore a more esoteric house-techno gray zone where spaced out sounds and hypnotic repetitive sounds predominate however neither track can compare to centred on a detuned synth line thats equal parts portable/bodycode and (the criminally underrated) repeat orchestra and leavened with a series of ur-style interstellar of blips bleeps and blurps this lopsided offbeat track inhabits a unique place inspired by the past and current innovations has carved out his own place in the house/techno firmament
while (real name adrian sandoval) has been djing in his native los angeles since the early 90s only recently has he hit his stride as a producer in the past two years hes released most of his music through modularz his own label which has also featured material from the likes of silent servant and fanon flowers marks s debut on the spanish label semantica and shows off his tougher take on 4/4 techno with reduced pummeling drums working their way through all four tracks clocking in at over eight minutes rolls on and on (and on) until halfway through when a noir-ish chord begins to strike on every other beat suspending an anxious melody that rises up in the tracks waning moments also shows a penchant for drawn-out melodies but this time the riffs are even tougher as they bounce among skittering bits of percussion on the flip final track underwhelms; its too static especially compared to that one a dynamic blend of sixteenth-note shakers and funky distorted grooves is the records best moment its a nice expansion of s sound and it offers further proof that semantica which at six years old now boasts almost 50 total releases is one of underground technos most consistently eclectic imprints
r dh d dons what looks like black metal corpse paint on the cover of the first sign that theres something dramatic happening here indeed for his debut album the berlin artist looks beyond his heady and hypnotic style of techno towards something bigger and more theatrical rearranges techno tropes brooding basslines anvil-sized kick drums into cinematic soundscapes opener has shades of the lan parsons projects sirius the classic instrumental that was used as the theme for the michael jordan-era chicago bulls nd like that 80s prog rock oddity the synth tones that r dh d employs on are lush and detailed but the ominous bassline is a little too on-the-nose the same goes for which introduces the lps first 4/4 kick pattern its as claustrophobic as any modern techno though the bleating john carpenter-like organ marrs the shadowy atmosphere r dh d strives for t its best the lps rich palette of blacks and greys is more engrossing than that of most of r dh ds contemporaries the sort of loopy techno track for which hes known is boosted by drone textures and rasping chords the -assisted is one of r dh ds heaviest techno tracks yet r dh d has adjusted to the album format without departing drastically from his established sound he breaks up the lps techno with experiments like one of the finest examples of the close tense mood hes going for its michael bay-like horn blasts hover at the edge of taste but its as entertaining as the action movie it could soundtrack is one of the years most epic techno albums but it often lacks the tension and subtlety that made r dh d one of the genres rising stars in the first place
two super talented musicians in gaetan schurrer and barry jamieson team up as and they deliver a two disc release on the imprint the features 4 very complex and upbeat productions that are sure to make a big impact disc one phat as starts the ep off with a bang creating a big chunky affair full of thick beats twisted effects and a evil gritty baseline that takes control of this beats of a track if you like your tracks big and intense then this is not to be missed what the funk follows and this is as the title suggests more of a groovy production the beats are still intense however with some smooth broken beat percussion driving the track alongside a smooth baseline and some acid riffs disc two rizing is certainly one of the most interesting tracks in the ep featuring some retro beats and percussive elements as well as some nice string patterns and melodic touches to a track that has a early 90 s feel thanks to the pads that feature throughout web-o-matic is a pretty intense production featuring stabbing and rolling deep baselines vocal hooks and an array of sounds and effects that all seem to combine very smoothly the smooth string patterns give the tracka nice feel to it as it concludes the ep off very nicely a strong release here from as these two lads deliver 4 pretty upbeat productions that are full of rich sounds and dirty moments
passenger records sister label (one of the many sister labels in s ranch) has certainly carved a niche for itself in the genre slowly shying away from the party-style bassline breaks it started off with to now where it fuses the sounds of electro hip hop and even house and techno for their latest release have invited a couple of their favourite breakbeat producers to give their interpretation of addiction/red out - release 3 on s roster roxillers chris carter takes on addiction and incorporates a drum beat with a 2-steppy shuffle to it and drops a bassline using the same melody as the original but on a massive warbling electro tip i remember when you would say yes i seem to recall a massive female vocal laid on top of the original which is suprisingly missing in carters remix my suspicions however lean towards an uncleared sample which probably explains its disappearance but it was an awesome vocal punk funkers jds drop their take of red out on the flip and for those who havent heard the original its s interpretation of the classic rip groove bassline featuring documentary style narration from a pilot explaining how the blood rushes to your head jds take a massive 303 line and place it on top of a more subtle beat compared to the original making this a very deep electro version of the tune with the original narrative vocals placed in the jds blender as the tune progresses jds slowly but surely increase the pressure on the electro 303 hook so by the end of the tune it builds into a massive rave-like beast after comparing this to the original 12 i cant help but feel somewhat disappointed as the original had so much energy this ones for fans of deep brooding electro styles

there used to be something mythical about cadenza every release seemed a secret communication from the mountains of switzerland by way of chile they didnt come often but when you held the wax in your hand you knew it was something to be pored over something worthy of lengthy consideration nowadays not so much as you might expect with the increased output there has been a precipitous drop off in quality but there are still some good ones among the bunch and unsurprisingly the latest with involved is one of them here the label boss teams up with for a track that evokes the bouncing minimalism of something like bomberos for much of its length opting to revel in the tranquil and hypnotic power of its synth riff and metronomic guitar the duo play around with the melody giving it over to bells strings and other instruments while constantly fiddling with whats going on underneath as well while not quite as head turning as say orange mistake its comes closer than nearly anything the imprint has released this year and team up on the b side for cabr n yet another chanting song in what seems like an absolutely line of them what sets this particular one apart however is that this isnt a lovely floaty chilean woman singing gently about independence its a forceful group that is wedded inextricably to the rhythm no counterpoint just pounding reinforcement to an already heavy tune not that this makes much of a difference: and s tune slots neatly into the percussive house of the moment something a cadenza release would have never found itself being accused of in years past well produced club fodder play it at home at your own risk
an unknown artist fits right in with the rest of the mathematics roster in the of is a spacious jazzy jam session with meandering keys over a chunky distorted beat it could spool out for another 15 minutes or so and still hold ones interest bonus track at the end contains straight-up sun ra-inspired space synthesizers more than just an interlude this piece dissolves into bursts of inspired noise on the b-side for a is decidedly lo-fi but intricate piano lines and sweeping treble strings join to create an uplifting almost orchestral techno tune finally the title track is gritty acid a la hieroglyphic being steady kick drum lays the groundwork for dancing bass and roving midrange
having played at fabric two years before he could legally drink there is no ing nue his debut ep for rightons lah lah lah proves that oth tracks are two prime cuts of urban house kicking off with dumb its weapons are a shuddering bassline that rises and drops like a bungee rope a dubby itchy synth refrain and swirling ethereal detroit pads ut its bout that grabs you by the throat and slams you against the wall while the hubbub of a distant party bubbles underneath a neo-rave hook kicks in with a sustained assault colliding into a titanium-strong kick/bass drum combo that rises in its intensity to near breaking point this is vibrant tech-tinged moreish and thoroughly modern house

either love or hate boy personally am still waiting for him to apologize for the abject at atrocity that was afeller skank (yes can hold grudges for decades ) but at the same time you cannot deny norman s flair for a pop hook hence why his famous remixes for the likes of shop or rmada are somehow still standing the test of time proof of his ongoing talent at r ing look no further than his southern fried imprint gladly purveying us with mainstream brattish house and poppy semiprecious electro pop moments on a regular basis southern fried tested is the label s latest double anthology of some of their most recent and not so recent cuts himself (under his guise) and the label s own underrated could say the compilation has guilty pleasure stamped all over it but to be fully honest there is nothing to be seriously embarrassed about on here: commercial big room house rarely sounds so shameless and enjoyable cd sees going for the label s most instantly recognizable and famous tracks (e g s and his much loved lo s remix of s unlikely dance hit re for s the s ) while opening and closing the whole thing with thus turning the mix into an unconcealed albeit maybe a bit too predictable and safe for some tastes populist ride those looking for the label s slightly less known stuff will head for cd on which m gandey skillfully crams almost thirty tracks into about one messy hour n a dance world where sounds and sub genres are out of fashion before even seeing the light of day it is actually more than nice to hear again for example the rea produced and two of my very own favorite dance singles in recent memory: funnily impudent they sit perfectly well next to s brassy to be a or uch s more jockish cuts such as shees at the b my e and p n with ss remix of ys ree originally released in 006 as a single southern fried has a truly gorgeous electro pop gem on its hands: those plaintive opening synths and melancholic lyrics could really melt the heart of even the most cynical skeptics and labells detractors altogether weirdly enough turns out it seems southern fried might have a key role to play in the actual nno pop electro house nn rave renaissance the british dance scene seems to be going through (again) these days having one foot in the pop charts and the other on the turnmills dancefloor but no matter what you think of the labells owner himself ittd be silly to deny yourself some genuine fun as showcased on this compilation because of some old unresolved issues you might or might not have had with housemartins
s a label it seemed that turbo records tiga s own montreal imprint was about to go the output route: a once relevant label dying from a slow and painful death while facing general indifference nd then four kick-ass releases this fall (see tomas arfod sweet light and oyz s new stuff) are re-injecting life into the label s corpse while reminding us of tiga s unique flair for electro bombs not much is said nor known about d i m (the press release reveals tiga himself doesn t even know who it is) but as an introductory greeting you could really find worse main track sisyphos is a huge digitalized builder: nothing much is happening really except numerous tweaks here and there on the effect board for seven minutes on top of a martial techno beat: think erotic discourse but more muscular and masculine -side is built from the same mould except slightly well noisier very versatile the end results could both work well either as set openers closers or as 3 a m pelvis-bangers and will surely please electro and techno djs alike seriously if this is any indication turbo is back in business and with releases such as this it could easily claim back its underground techno crown most exciting comeback of the year then

seems like an ideal artist for they both share a knack for heaviness that verges on the abrasive and they both cherry-pick ideas from various genres without ever sounding like one thing continues where the track wip s last appearance on left off serving up four variations on his lumbering take on uk dance music each track on gets its own side of vinyl and the ep is built on basslines that sound like theyre trying to shake the needle out of the groove two of the tracks reinforce s typical sound: is classic with its wobbly kick drums and dubbed-out horns but the quaking low-end and repeating vocal sample are extra threatening meanwhile takes one of those dark keysound-style rollers and slows it down so that every drum lands with purpose the other two incorporate acid into s brew: on squelchy leads pile up like sludge while adds a 2-steppy skip to the equation like the rest of the ep they offer subtle variations on the formula that are different enough to keep them interesting
whether you fall for the inevitable local backlash against the urist friendly watergate club its certainly assembling some telling promotional clips for both in outsiders with this years mix series for the second edition theyve called on resident home wner where onur zers watergate 01 was a strictly minimal affair s working from a more broadly colored palette far more in line with his own release earlier this year though he sifts older tracks like the clubfooted house of s s broad shouldered in the mix centers around some of s deft club home st outs a well crafted sequence fit for house parties lengthy autumn drives or just sweeping up around the home unlike many of s more prominent mixes limbers up not via stretches of polyester house or jiggy funk but with contemplative star gazing cuts fuzzy vision trance of four s miss s snowy static take on s offer a distinctly cozy almost ambient take on the mix opener extends a soft invite a chance take a look out at the spree or in whatever seasonal perch open you t doesnt last long with its disorienting hum cry chugging beat s thats a cuts through with a getaway offer the lippy funk of jus stirs up a small physical revolt of its own black detroit night in s breaks the mixs warm liquidity but again chooses a track thats not necessarily designed around its physicality; s playing above the neck as much as below the hip using its loosely confined ne highlight how well it plays solitude o but its reverberating synths begin ripple outward push at the edges of its own claustrophobia where the insistent disco funk of the s works keep you s is debilitating house a dark lullaby sleeplessness long empty hours but its tobias s mix of s own that provides the late centerpiece spacious gently propulsive in how it reshapes his favored remake choice though it closes with loose pocket house s of the 94 cid jesus remix of s for the most part is child happy melding emotive techno with some of the years steamier cardiac fare course it aint really comin from the bedroom: it was recorded live at the club in ugust heat but there are as many headplay moments as those that make your legs twitch s be commended for a mix that for all of its core biggies is still markedly distinct from the years other big mixes thats reason enough find as many times places pretty strangers settle in with with as any can think of
considering their recent spate of techno releases its easy to forget what turbo used to sound like scottish duo are here to bridge the gap between old and new with their first proper wax release on the montreal label their gang 49 on this years excellent new jack compilation was like gesaffelstein stumbling around tresor and continues in that manic direction coating prickly electricity in barbed wire the title track is a snaking field of distortion bounded by frantically panning drums; think turbos most aggressive electro and run everything into the red until its a quivering mass of overdriven frequencies randomer steps in for an even more hedonistic remix twisting the thickset static into his own trademark piledriving thrash techno while blawan associate sunil turns the titular vocal sample into something rather rude-sounding and minimizes its serrated swell into searing acid lines flipside common bounce is built from the same filthy and jagged cloth with a meek drum pattern thats quickly overtaken by a corrosive bassline is the most interesting production here taking a broken piston breakbeat and couching it in a techno wireframe recalling the barely controlled chaos of in slightly more flattering light
on last years bless warren harris angled his return as as a reconnection with his production roots the album did contain a few stray prog-y fusion numbers but it mostly had the familiar markings of his style: sweetly sung samples warm rhodes loose percussion in contrast the first installment of the welcomes ep series which features four knobbly downtempo pieces seems designed to surprise sounds like an intro crafted to create atmosphere that might later be filled with four-on-the-floor rhythms but it actually points to the records general mood the familiar pads and rhodes are present but their consonance is distorted by irregular percussion and uncharacteristically staccato bass is remarkable for its many understated melodies but also because it contains a rare instance of rupture in harriss music: a clipped rimshot that sounds like digital glitch and bleed into each other the soft chords of the former echoed in the stabs of the latter also features one of the more unusual basslines three slowly churning notes without a hint of legato or slap is the most propulsive of the bunch but its still a far cry from the absolute serenity harris has pursued on earlier recordings with any luck these tracks herald more unexpected music
ive always been greatly enamored by body riddle chris clarks 2006 opus for warp the record blended techno jazz kosmiche idm hip-hop into a maelstrom of unhinged electronic music it made you feel like anything could happen at any given moment and it would still somehow make sense listening to the third album by i have to wonder if ryan west shares my affections the london musician got his start making symphonic breakcore and chiptune in 2007 which has over time matured into a more serious analog-based sound recent records like odyssey and sonne posed west as a crossover electronic artist in the vein of clark and jon hopkins (indeed theyve taken notice of his work) is the first full-length in that style offering nine lovingly crafted and expressive compositions that cherish mood as much as bespoke timbres so the albums only major issue stems from the overall feeling that youve heard its music before or at least something very close to it in one song you might hear a synth thats tweaked like one in clarks herzog or one that flutters and pulses as if an echo of the bassline in hopkins open eye signal probably the closest resemblance is the centerpiece unfurls moody jazz drums and muted synth beds that evoke body riddle closer the autumnal crush albeit with less gusto and conviction which winds up being another of s downfalls: for all its well-crafted sounds and depth of emotion the album rarely goes anywhere unexpected bold or even all that exciting in fact west holds back at the worst possible times songs like and swell to a near climax before inexplicably receding from the precipice restraint can certainly be a sign of maturity but like any tool you have to know when and how best to use it despite its shortcomings is a fine album for those interested in analog electronics and curious what can be done with them outside of a club environment west has a strong command of his machines and how to arrange them; his biggest strength is making fully fleshed-out productions from only a handful of sounds (the way naturally gathers together a simple beat one jumpy synth loop and a few starry pads and briefly sneaks a guitar in is especially nice ) but now that has made it clear west has no trouble building vibrant electronic music from scratch it should be interesting to see if he can use those skills to uncover something wholly his own
with a string of compelling 12-inches from rising acts like innergaze ital and magic touch 100 silk the clubby imprint of the la-based not not fun label has quickly become a name to watch with a debut ep from 100 silk broadens its palette expanding from bedroom-y dream disco to include distinctly housier pursuits the title track is a grade-a chugger that wears its hand-me-down madchester grooves like a snazzy second-hand coat: a slow-mo disco-house groove honky-tonk piano stomp and a drugged-out steamroller style i half-expect shaun ryder to show up as catchy as is its brother what steals the show at least for me because it departs from the cosmic playbook into a much baggier world governed by unpredictable sampledelic weirdness twinkly piano notes and sneering pitched-down vox whirl in and out of the frame suddenly giving way to bluesy twin-saxophone riffage and sputtering handclaps composed of two feel-good instrumentals the back half of the record belongs to the same aesthetic universe as the first but remains on its own planet rides a breezy percolated groove into jazzy-keyed balearic bliss but a relentless low-end and high bpm keeps it on the dance floor it succeeds where its b-side cohort comes up short as the title might suggest aims for similar regions of solar-powered ecstasy but sounds like it got left out in the sun too long and could use a nap the soprano sax is a bold choice here (isnt it always ) but its kenny g riffs are simply egregious an ostensibly ironic ha-ha moment on a record that doesnt need one
follow up a fine brace of reworkings for terje saethers recent breed ep on their label with a clutch of ultra deep remixes of their own the duo of nadja lind and helmut ebritsch have a swagger about them at present bolstered by the original mix here rolling along to a snappy rhythm with a feint whiff of 2-step its punctuated by subtle rhodes and piano stabs and minimal flourishes fellow berlin resident helly s take doesnt quite have you in a headlock like the original; theres no denying it gives off a warm glow from its afterburners as it jets off into the deep house cosmos but itll be a little too sedate for some melbournes mark baumann who runs aussie label pinksilver rolls his sleeves up and gets stuck into his duties in his markojux guise to a nagging prog trance-like undercurrent baumann adds frilly piano motifs and what sounds like a cat on slow spin in a tumble dryer its pipped at the post for the go-to track on this ep by yapacc though as befits a man who has designed and demonstrated equipment for synth and module manufacturer mfb its technically adroit low-slung tech funk with neat ambient touches and frequent textural shifts
s first three releases from nyra october borai and christopher rau tended towards the monochrome focusing firmly on beats over hooks the label combined depth and rigour in a way thats proved popular with djs like spencer parker and nick h ppner jocks who tend towards the long-term effects of layering and groove rather than tracks with immediate impact with that in mind this label debut from venetian producer fits s remit perfectly lying somewhere between subterranean grumble and elegiac deep house theres a deft contrast between the sides both tracks on the a unfurl lush pads amid percussion that twitters over plump subs with offering a slightly more expansive approach to melodies than bs offerings are trackier especially is minimalist almost to a fault milking its gurgles and moans until you long for the introduction of some new noise and though has more to distinguish it you wont be whistling it the morning after but then this is music that values atmosphere over the individual moment

swedish vinyl-only label kept it deep and dubby in its first year with releases from veteran producers norm talley and js and three artists ness nax_ cid and claudio prc who represent a key element of italys techno scene then theres described as the secret project of a well-known german producer he or she handled s fourth release and now returns with the second half of the two-part series maurizio is mentioned by the label as a point of reference and this is apt as lengthy dub techno is the name of the game here the eight-minute 2 1 is this records more upfront cut with punchy chords and percussive trebles while a short sliding synth line lower in the mix helps keep things interesting for headphone listeners 2 2 my favorite of the two tracks is longer slower warmer and more submerged its aqueous chords anchored to a velvety low-end ll in all nothing revelatory but with a less-is-more approach and an emphasis on crisp tight sound design both tracks should do just fine in the mix
thoughtful might be last descriptor a producer wants ascribed to ir music but its strangely apt when discussing s latest ep arcane theory its not a knock and its not a platitude arcane theory is a compact three-tracker that strays in and around many conventional house-isms but manages a depth and ingenuity in sound that is purely his own and its a result diligence and patience as much as anything else: its s first release in over a year and only his third release ever the result is what you would expect from such a slow-brewing producer: exceptionally fine-grained house with every kick synth and snare shaped to a tee strangely one closest referents might be vangelis oth producers crouch behind emotive synth-work thats highly expansive and visual while is a little less panoramic in his vision (it is dance music after all) hes on to same ultra-landscaped energy and spatial elegance every sound loaded with gobs texture case in point: highlight a flanged-out lounge groove that in a more creative and sensual universe would be ultimate convenience store track a tireless loop phased synth lines that sounds as good front-and-center as it does in background next time takes this long lets hope he comes back with a soundtrack
cinematic has been a purveyor of deep techno and house since 2008 despite remaining a relatively unsung enterprise over the past few years the imprint has worked with a host of producers from the more cerebral end of the dance spectrum including patrice scott fumihiro hoshi john tejada and john beltran the north london labels third release of the year comes from label debutant mullers is something a bit different for cinematic: emotive vocal-driven house paced by weighty kicks and claps and cloaked in ambient swirls it just about steers clear of mawkish indulgence instead offering a nice depth references interpretation is an altogether tougher reprise that loops shards of the vocal around condensed percussion while ramping up the originals ambient qualities into driving trance propelled by an undercurrent of tunneling reverb mobias is significantly darker with hieroglyphic turning in a stripped-back alternative
after searing through dancefloors in the northern hemisphere s summer across the ocean now comes to life with a set of remixes by max graham dean coleman and samio under the watchful eye of records the original delivers 12 minutes of many glorious and uplifting moments laden with a healthy portion of infectious melodies and a shaking bassline the continual slow build of the elements help reinforce the strength of this track the main breakdown features an old school piano and lifts up the overall feeling nicely though quickly overshadowed by the strong bassline and melodies max graham is up next with his manta ray remix as it takes it up notch with smooth production full of grit and energy apart from providing solid beats and sublime melodies max delivers a unique and devastating bassline that will surely turn a dance floor on its head an epic breakdown really boosts the quality of the overall feel rather impressive to say the least label favourite dean coleman shows his colours with a memorable remix full of great rolling melodies and huge breakdowns bundled with loads of emotion dean stays true to the original and features piano samples throughout while overlaying a chugging bassline and drums the special addition of a gorgeous middle eastern vocal gives this mix a little variety moving on with samio as he returns to deliver deep seated remix full of dark pulsating rhythms and trickling melodies whilst pulling in that emotive element from the original the mix just rolls along nicely and when it turns down into the breakdown things turn a little sideways with some new sounds but it soon moves back into the main dark bassline which is quite a standout here reliving the summer is what this release is all about put quality and quantity together and you have a hot package varied remixes by all involved and it s quite hard to put my finger on what s the hottest all i can say is give this a listen
ive never been to a discovery party but if their fledgling label is anything to go by it seems like a good time after a west african detour with analog players societys coule a the nyc crew return to breezy 4/4 form with vincent runetto jr aka a local resident whose first ep minces lo-fi new york house with the sunny skies of some imagined disco paradise with its wonky synth lines and light jog of a drum pattern something about feels weary like its been out in the sun too long as it develops though it borrows italos cool midnight glow with a catchy lead and a doo-wop bassline is even more sedate with a mumbling vocal and some jazzy instrumentation it looks to the dance floor with half-lidded eyes perfect for an opening set fort a rit whose emotive disco resembles s remixes he ups the tempo but does little with the track other than reinforce its low-end if anything thats a compliment to runetto it says a lot when a new artist outshines an established producer
the first song of three on this debut by (aka addy weitzman and maurice knecht of montreal) is synth pop with an ear clearly on hot chip ut while the song aims for ingratiating it falls somewhere closer to blah re are some good lines ( sky is always shining in / its always raining diamonds in ) but the keyboards plink too politely for their own good on the other hand stays with you or at least its hook does a mournfully intoned whoa-oh-oh that harks back to early 80s rit-mope with its stuffy head held high it goes on too long but thats the nature of that particular beast when ewan gets his hands dirty here everything else takes a flier he improves considerably sharpening weitzmanns vocal line by grafting it onto a lean electro-flavored groove with spooky keyboards conga flavoring and pumping disco bass in s hand the movement from the verse to chorus flashback swimming through this fantasy / going to and never coming back moves from offhanded to insinuating especially with the backing vocals assuming new prominence s catalog wasnt exactly short on revelatory remixes but now it has another
rare case of truth in labeling: the title cut from this two tracker by the somewhat mysterious actually does consist of two chords and is indeed deep as hell as a matter of fact ut the rather prosaic moniker fails to mention one important point which is that the tune is absolutely gorgeous the chords in question are inviting and pillowy-soft a slight tremelo enhancing their inviting nature ut the track aint no wimp an angular four-note bleep pattern vaguely detroit-esque lends edge to the sound as does a somewhat monstrous sub-bass throb dd a touch of creaky analog dub trickery buried well into the mix and seemingly emitted from some far-off corner of ones perception and youve got yourself a beautiful track that would sound fantastic as the sun comes up at some all-night rave the flip-side track works a similar territory its another deep and cushiony two-chord treat but if anything its even more dreamy and seductive losing the slight rawness and glitchiness of in exchange for one of the most sublime string pads youve ever heard its a simple yet dazzling number itll be interesting to see what else is capable of this particular ep though dazzling is a bit of a one-trick pony but if we had to guess wed wager that he (she they ) will be delivering the goods for some time to come
were not sure how they did it (roses chocolate sour diesel ) but the minds at managed to sign up mr harvey assett for a proposed string of three releases for harv watchers this is no small event despite keeping up a relentless djing schedule the mans not put anything on wax under his own name for ten years or so clearly though harvey left his heart in left field oth tracks on this first 12-inch emanate an oddball inventiveness an investment in risk and surprise and that innate unpredictable sense of what works thats followed him since the days of tonka hi-fi two decades ago for someone whose reputation has been largely built around weirdo disco and cosmic out-there beats the opening beats of might seem unexpected ( wait is harvey doing a minimal track ) ut before you know it that spindly little germanic groove with floating kompakty blips gets its wig split by a violent burst of looped guitar feedback a clownish near-delirious rupture that absconds from the scene leaving a speedy disco vibe and a girl celebrating iiiiiiigggg guns minimal and house elements continue to deftly dart around one another opening and closing little portals to other worlds the vocal tossed in like an rthur russell absurdity the hendrix guitar full of sudden flaunt and wail this is what innovation sounds like: youve never heard it before but it makes sense right away this counts double for oots the deeply blunted alearic voyage on the flip which arguably steals the show harveys shown his mastery of a number of different styles but as far as psychedelic beach jams are concerned there are few who can touch him this is partly because he can cobble together a trippy chill-out track without invoking a number of commonplace elements like mellow chord changes or funky smoothness oots instead relies on a dub groove and a phased-out hi-hat working double-time southern rap-style backing up even more guitar-shredding and some echoey female toasting simultaneously chilled-out expansive and edgy the track foregrounds a sense of contemplative exploration no wonder the girl keeps repeating locus solus the lonely place here feels like some sunbaked mediterranean island that harveys steering the gunship towards with a hairy grin and a captains hat
jonny burnips career so far has been marked by a fondness for chicago house originals but he also has a healthy disregard for convention that takes his productions somewhere else entirely its five years since the londoner released king of the witches one of the more interesting releases on dfa in recent years it was warm tech-flavoured disco a style hes been finessing ever since with releases for the likes of unknown to the unknown launches the label with a pair of tracks that are among his more conventional offerings the aphex twin-esque title of is misleading burnip instead dips back into high-stepping mills-ian techno replete with laser bursts spanking pianos and eq tweaking its duracell-bunny energy levels are carried over to but here burnip switches tack building muscular house out of garagey hi-hats distorted vocal loops and frazzled bass synths theres a lot to like about s punchy approach to production
rarely put a foot wrong theyre among the uks most prolific techno acts these days spending their time turning out effective club tracks the trios latest offering is the second instalment in sound of sheffield a four part digital only series that started in march like most of their recent work the three tracks here are solid and will provide any techno dj with a variety of peak time material gets things underway with an arpeggio hats and an acid squelch its fast paced and simple but progresses nicely through a few understated breakdowns and a snappy intermittent snare two versions of distaster follow both feature syncopated drums and a tougher more minimalist aesthetic than the opener of the two variations at panorama bar is the cut youll want to cue up it kicks harder than anything else on the record carrying a more straightforward beat without losing any of the originals moodiness
s new single for a r t less is an intriguing affair with six distinct tracks instead of the usual two or four it feels more like a collection of short stories than a single or even a mini-album more so since the tracks are not bound together by any defining style or mood and instead play out in their own untouched worlds nonetheless it is clear that weisemann has used this release as a way to experiment with his signature sound for example several of the tracks including the opening title track are brief beatless and highly evocative as if trying to mark out a mood in haiku or as sonic glyphs and 2 in particular both sound smooth and evanescent plucked melodies and pale ambient winds stir deep passing emotions whereas the beautiful chiming chords of samurai play off a gentler living innocence in contrast is an epic banger that sees weisemann doing his best to appropriate the berghain sound despite the alluring roughness the high end percussion works too hard while the bass kick marches rather than dances is another epic track and the most traditional sven sounding moment deep sultry and haunting it betrays a hint of venom in its core overall may be something of a mixed bag but it is one that suggests the mark of a mature artist trying to expand his own possibilities
the next release on features a track each by tony thomas and mastik soul showcasing their tribal sides first up is primitive by tony thomas and despite the nice drum patterns and tribal elements the track certainly lacks a cutting edge usually present in tony s work turn it over and mastik soul deliver accurate drumming and again it really is aimed at those who love their tribal drums as it doesn t really offer anything outside this square primitive drums follows which is essentially a percussive tool full of drum beats if you love your tribal music and i mean really love then this is for you if not then look the other way
the opening track acid attack from one of stockholms busiest and brightest young producers john dahlback kicks off with an electro-house rhythm before a bristling bass/synth really starts driving the piece along an off-key arpeggio soon comes throwing the listener off by playing a kind of cat-and-mouse game with our senses the driving bassy synth pushes us on with the arpeggio counteracting things to create confusion this tug of war develops almost becoming the pattern entirely throughout the track this track is quite a head-turner and should create a stir inside a club when played out (6/10) shuffle attack has more of a rock feel with its drums on the intro the addition of metallic-abrasion to the clanging pipe-beating noise quickly develops the track into a cheeky electro number with stop/start funky kicks the synthetic-rock vibe is completed by the addition of a warbling synth all this comes to an brief end with an unnerving suspense-filled interval which uses psychotic chord arrangements that just build up until the drums intensify and bam - were back into booty-shakin electro business very catchy indeed (7/10) the final installment in this package arp attack is a fairly straight-up electro-house beat put alongside a warped bass-synth(again ) weirded-out elements creep in as dark touches create an apocalyptic feel and things get murky shuddering beats and plenty of hi-end means this is a very busy track however it still manages to hold on to some portion of a steady groove until the track fizzles out not as lively as the second track but useful (6/10)

considering cant is released the same month as another new 12-inch the red rope ep its not surprising that they have similar temperaments oth plates blend industrial intensity synth pop romance and rave-informed pacing so assiduously that easy categorization isnt possible nevertheless there are a few key differences where red rope is introspective and despairing cant finds noah nthony in a particularly extroverted mood as he unleashes two long-form cuts that are thanks to their unremitting momentum downright mind-altering the new order-flavored title track (imagine a crunchier permutation of the lue monday template) is the most club-tailored thing has released so far shadowy and elegant with a finely calibrated murmured chorus cant actually feels self-conscious of its own superiority its more than a great tune; its the sound of nthony reveling in his bold command of what most of us would agree is a truly iconic sound isnt as audacious yet its snarled interplay of corroded tape manipulation furious synth patterns and abstract laments means its significantly more complex the piece contains the kind of heavy layering and ever-evolving motifs that reveal different dimensions with each subsequent spin
chief engineer at erlins manmade mastering appeared on r s latest critics roundtable exchange to give a crash course in the abstruse process its an edifying discussion for sure one from which i gleaned three fundamentals: mastering aims to (1) shore up a tracks sound design (2) balance its mix and (3) more or less ensure things dont sound like shit not surprisingly these are the very qualities that distinguish xaviers own productions in the particular the two finely crafted tracks comprising this ep oth sides are tightly focused affairs in possession of considerable drive muscle too but its never too bulky or thick ltostratus snares and hi-hats are so compact they more or less live inside the gargantuan bassline really striking are the meticulously etched growls and howls that play demonic counterpoint while consuming one another in pulsating fashion ll in all theres a subtly rocking feel to the groove that has me thinking of the more visceral moments to be found on mark es stone reaker album from last year the title track in contrast is a bit more lower chakra in nature lunging more and more suggestively as it progresses its architecture is also more complex vertical and spacious deep reverb-stained voices (classic techno pitch-shift style) spit stuttering gobbledygook that xavier gradually transforms into a kind of funky pointillism rittle metallic chords try punching through; either they succeed or wind up melting into an electric blur that further accentuates the syncopation
the witch doctor of twisted tribal house steve lawler seemed the perfect fit to add a little funk to a lost dusty vinyl that murmurs a spell when played in kate hudsons excursion into voodoo hell the drum beat makes you imagine some madam santeria tapping away on a tanbou fires blazing in the bayous of louisiana while a catchy melody perhaps a little too brass carries the track forward keeping your head bopping over all this a dead priest rants on about the devils house asserting the sinister flavor that lawler is attributed to his remix is one of those slow down groove along save up that energy and wait for the next big tune while theres nothing extraordinary buzzing in it its nevertheless good fun in lawlers dark house on the b-side the richard dinsdale remix kicks off with eerie bits of whispered dialogue from the film segueing nicely into some nifty deep house the tribal drums are more passive popping in along with the preacher s devil s house rant which is sampled even more heavily yet it s the whispers which dinsdale distorts with a delay that really sets this mix on fire as some slick synths peak into a wicked groove that never gets too big but doesn t need to either its a faster steady pace creepy cool and kicking this ones for those strange cats that wear their sunglasses at night even at the clubs
after a strong ep on uk outpost perc trax denvers takes a turn on scottish experimental imprint broken_20 though a veteran the techno industry finesse is still a new name on the production side things here he shows a wandering eye with three very different styles techno some more convincing than others first thing youll notice about is how waify it is; the track is framed by flimsy hi-hats that sound forged from razor-thin blades yre not quite in time with the kicks which would have been jarring if everything didnt feel like it was padded with styr oam returning to the tough sound his perc trax ep is deeply droning techno that keeps one foot firmly above the fog at all times its free-floating woodblocks bring to mind sandwell district but its grotty thump is totally singular; this is a brand techno that prefers the atmospherics a humid rainforest over a clanging warehouse testing listeners patience emerges from three minutes near-silence to a deliberate wade through post-punk atmospherics like its s tly whispering every percussive element here finesses restraint is elegant rather than hesitant a few broken_20 associates jump on board to give the tracks some healthy sanguine makeovers greek duo cassegrain strangle the subtlety out turning its dusky ambience into a de facto chord progression for the percussion to trample over label boss tvo beefs up two ways: first with a heart-flutter pitter-patter that gives it some welcome low-end oomph and secondly by turning the track to dub techno jelly but its colony party associate tengui who wins the eps crown with a noise/drone rework that unfolds slowly over its ten minutes like a wide yawn into a churning abyss
s was a fitting last word for an album that used house and techno to illustrate quiet musings on heartbreak and devotion its a dance track that refuses to drop holding back the full weight of its sanguine bassline and clubby thump just as underplays his sadness when he sings i cant tell you how hard it has been since i left you the song is also an ideal candidate for a beefed-up remix and carl craig doesnt disappoint with his floor-ready version of but his production filed under the c2 alias fails to bring the original into any unfamiliar territory: its content to simply give heft to an already strong song its not until craigs big brassy groove is over halfway through that he changes up the structure and sound pallette introducing a woozy breakdown of anxious strings and discordant organs ahead of the triumphant finale there is a payoff but everything beforehand is a little underwhelming for an artist with some truly remarkable remixes to his name

youd be right to accuse james t cotton of a slavish devotion to a sound but that merely sidesteps the fact that cotton is tadd mullinix dabrye and sk-1 mullinix is hardly a one-trick pony hes one who simply divides his music between his aliases instead of grouping them all under one moniker the cotton name for those not familiar is mullinixs tribute to ron hardy (and the music hed play at chicagos music box) is the frenetic acid pop that never was a tune that doesnt let up for more than eight minutes culminating in a chorus of voices wordlessly singing the melody follows the down-to-business acid house its flightier and more melodic a miniature with surprising muscle the flip rick wade figures out how to translate into his signature rhodes-heavy deep house it gives up the ecstasy in favor of smoothness and loses something in the process regardless of its source material it does the same thing as many of his previous releases only with a sample of someone saying on time its uninspiring and the same goes for its partner on the side a jtc called which does little to excite beyond its obvious referents nods to the past and adds a wrinkle or two but doesnt have much new to say at all
wallop recordings latest release has a puerto rican flavour with a track from carloz lopez and john ender rios chunked up in tribal flavour from the start pushes a slightly progressive tone with heavy vocals and droning synths that beckon us to listen further while rhythmic percussion continually alters making it slightly reminiscent of early swain and snell releases the dirty mood set makes this perfect for the peakier end of a set on the flip is a neater x-man dub that takes it much deeper than the original with the same energy infused percussion in contrast to a darkened mood of eerie synth phrases that float around in the background this is another solid release in a string of recent ones thats begun to get wallop fired up again
with so much new music out there you may wonder why resident advisor is reviewing a cd limited to 500 copies that was conceived not as an album but as a suite of music for a sound installation at a recent exhibition at berlins haus der kulturen called doofe musik lieder zum tr umen bet uben und vergessen (translation: dumb music songs for dreaming numbing and forgetting) the answer is because it is by a man who under the pseudonym gas arguably created a new idiom for electronic music working at the interface of ambient and 4/4 techno his immersive work was unusually atmospheric and emotionally-charged its use of repetitive loops in a fog-bound landscape of fathomless bass and muffled kicks laid the groundwork for everything from the field to much of todays dub techno r ckverzauberung 9 isnt a gas retread but it is instantly recognizable as voigt with its slushy sound-quality warm vinyl crackle and use of repetition to foster a kind of transcendent mindfulness still the tone and structure are different where gas evoked german forests in autumn r ckverzauberung 9 calls to mind a pristine beach where waves lap against the shore under clear blue skies also its even more militant in its repetition there are no kick drums to add momentum just four or five intertwined loops that run on and on through the five tracks seemingly unchanged for minutes at a time in its execution it recalls manuel g ttschings e2-e4 but stripped of any flashiness or excess fat of course its all part of voigts plan to lull you into a false sense of stasis skip between the tracks and the way voigt mutates the fragments and patterns hes working with becomes obvious 9 2 has the feel of a warped dub-reggae record worn stoned beatific endless but by 9 4 those brass samples have through tiny adjustments become almost jaunty its not so much those major shifts that matter so much as the way that if you can lose yourself in r ckverzauberung 9 two things happen the first is that you almost begin to aurally hallucinate imposing your own interpretation on the loops and hearing each few bars differently the second is that when voigt does introduce an objectively minor new element the impact is momentous such is the level of your absorption the cumulative effect of all this will depend very much on your own headspace if you fight r ckverzauberung 9 or if you listen to it while doing anything else it can be nauseating claustrophobic oppressive instead in the same way that people talk about being in the right frame of mind to take lsd you have to open yourself to the kind of mindflight it enables one which only you will be able to articulate
though hes lived in london for years knowles is a quintessential welsh producer the sparse and hilly country where he grew up tends to foster heady sounds: there are hardly any clubs so djs earn their chops playing intimate events mostly filled with other artists and music obsessives (this includes the mighty freerotation festival) perhaps as a result of this knowles records are perfectly mixable but also dreamy understated and not conventionally party-friendly made for the dj in other words if not the club (the same can be said of the music he and joe ellis release on their label untilmyheartstops ) his new ep on bristols nicely captures this singular quality knowles and both specialize in deep and offbeat grooves which is very much what we get here creates a kind of bobbing motion through an irregular kick pattern with a single clap in every other measure the brilliant title track is a kaleidoscope of angular rhythms cloaked in ghostly ambiance and dotted with thick bass tones my heart stopped beating has a touch of portishead to it thanks to a sad piano and sultry vocal snippet which frame a muffled stepping rhythm all three are gentle and immersive and for my money the best tracks yet from this under-appreciated artist
lately its been a guessing game as to which style marcus lambkin will tackle next but you can usually count on him to pull it off on its the irishman taps comedian-turned-vocalist (who also appeared on 2013s excellent we got a love ) and looks towards some of the older shit robot records offering up a tough slice of house informed by dfas classic punk-funk sound its is a simple track with a wiry bassline snappy handclaps and a synth that washes over everything whenever lambkin needs to let off steam is the real star here though he begins with a kitschy spoken word before lifting off into a soulful refrain its remarkable how he jumps from hook to hook transforming the tracks mood without the instrumental changing all that much johnny tones down the more flamboyant parts of its flattening it into a dirty lo-fi lockstep and while theres something to be said for the contrast of soaring vocal against s rigid grinding in suppressing the tracks uplifting side the remix is nowhere near as captivating as the original

brighton-based producer has so far avoided the more generic end of the current 90s garage-house revival since he arrived in 2011 via throwing snows left_blank imprint hes gone on to release through dummy and church and his latest is a three-track ep through further developing his lamenting sound underpins a hum of ambience with rattling woodblock percussion before a looping female vocal moves the track towards balearic waters heads assuredly into steppier territory while goes deeper with mellow elongated chords providing a spacious fluidity laurence citizen blake remixes installing slinky tones and shuffling pads to give an early 90s east coast feel thats certainly likeable but slightly predictable may not brim with the fresh thinking as prior offerings but does manage to maintain some of s early promise

s mark brydon and rosin murphy are coming out with a new album and the first single to be released from it is complete with hot mixes from the likes of timo maas it could be their biggest single since sing it back original the original version is a highly orchestral affair on a latin vibe it features nice use of acoustic guitar to create a flamenco feel with the strings in the background adding a dramatic effect to the song not really one for a dance floor though timo maas main mix on a dooms night style no the man behind one of 2000s biggest remixes has gone for a more funky summer house feel with his mix the wicked slap bass line is what makes this tune so danceable eventually adding in more elements like some funky guitar pity the summer is about to end here as this would make an awesome closing tune martin buttrich remix timo maas production partner who helped timo out with his remix comes out with his own version another funky house version with a melody line that feels like it has been sampled off a 1990s diva classic ie ultra nate crystal waters or one of those us ones max reich vocal mix a bit of a floor stomper with this version keeping in the elements of the original tune but mixed up into a four to the floor thumper im definitely down with that timo maas remix
a fair few hailed ed davenports on nrk as one of the debut artist albums of 2012 the berlin-based brits new label is named after said release as is the second ep from his inland project picks up where last julys eponymous ep on falkplatz left off focusing again on deep horizon-spanning techno this feel is most prevalent on the title track with davenport using elongated chords to create a spacious environment for the percussion to atmospherically build is a tighter-packed and somewhat inferior alternative version with less depth and a more driving tempo restores the early serenity by suspending euphoric pulses over subtle yet effective claps while completes the package in a trance-like haze throughout the ep davenport resists epic crescendos or rushing breakdowns instead an understated momentum is maintained giving the release an immersive and timeless quality
continues its flirtatious relationship with techno with yet another modern classical remix ep ut whos complaining taken from a new album luxembourg pianist and composer that combines the compositions of ach and john cage the ep features worthwhile reinterpretations from lawrence and (who was credited with post-production on the album) mvo serves up a slice of spaced-out spatial techno with his remix of note development nr a discombobulated kick drum finding the tracks unsure footing in a dense fog of droning samples using panning and soundstaging tiny echoes and other percussive products are shoved into odd corners and the melodic samples are flattened out into thin layers that sneak between the chiseled rock of s programming theres also the short development a recording gently futzed with to pleasing if insubstantial effect on the other side lawrence lays down a gentle tinfoil beat over that gets kicked around the occasional handclap and ascending rocky bassline the mood is unsettling as dissonant chords lurk beneath the surface but the halfway point they break out into gorgeous melodic streamers that sound more like the lawrence we know while techno remixes of modern classical might seem gimmicky the legendary german label shows time and time again the possibilities for synthesis meshing the crystal-clear textures of their recordings with the considerably dustier beats of the remixes

currently living in portugal finnish musician jari marjam ki aka is firmly establishing a melody-driven tech sound of his own his earlier productions for kickboxer kayra and pimio found their way into the bags of djs such as gui boratto dominik eulberg and jussi pekka and on his latest cut for bloop hes lending a little more depth to his forms is not too loud and not too soft built on top of a deep groovy bassline the filtered vocal and frenetic ticks set the pace for a great record that ll work well accompanying early cocktails at the bar on the b-side s k is a string laden affair built around bells and percussion but itts still mellow stuff unlike previous tracks such as loytotavaraa and koko kokkoo there are no growling stabs of bass here but it suffers a little from the lack of grit cosmic aka steve barnes works the remix for a turning the original into a chimera-like track filled with sci-fi effects distorted vocals and itching melodies thatts got peaktime or after hours written all over it itts a great track good enough even to compare to the mighty cosmic h in the right hands
mob records has established itself as the purveyor of international breakbeat with releases coming not only from the uk but also from the usa australia hong kong italy spain and sri lanka the latest release from the label comes from from mexico who drops off a neat party rocker on mobs doorstep - continuing the international flavour comes rico tubbs from finland who gets roped in for remix duties the original version starts off with a fatboy slimish style big beat which sounds like its been crossed over with rennies unforgettable break from his remix of zeros emit (especially noticable towards the end) and its not long before the funky disco guitars and fartlike bassline kick in accompanied by a soulful female vocal sample that makes you say oh mama theres a busy backdrop of subtle horns and buzzing tech sweeps which make this tune sound very full rico tubbs remix on the other hand takes the form of a b-boy electro rocker as he beefs up the horn sample and disco guitar riff at the beginning rico then incorporates an electro flavoured synth hook and plays around with the female vocal sample for those who have heard his remix of sotos ghetto blast ya which hasnt been released yet will be able to hear ricos trademark production and steppy break
s debut album released last year after a nigh-on two-decade career felt more like a collection of singles than a long-player it proved what we already knew that watson is superb at bucking house jams but revealed that hes less adept at the nuances required for an album his return to the shorter format for the special editions offshoot of semteks dont be fraid label sees him back on firmer ground hallmarks of watsons sound are front and centre throughout the stomp and wiggle of roland machines loops pushed to breaking point and synths that whine like foxes in heat but theres also a layer of grit that makes seem dated if not outright revivalist take the is the eps most rambunctious cut which centres on an acid line burbling above a one-note sub tried and tested trope sure but watson deconstructs it in the tracks closing moments and just prevents it from being too staid is more functional its rolling drums lightened by a riff that doubles back on itself as though trying to lose a tail this is loop techno delivered with a grin in contrast sits somewhere between chez damier and mr g with a clatter of bongos and a sticky low-end though executed with panache ends up a little too safe to really wow
eric estornel had a mammoth year in 2011 under the nom de production it was a long time coming to be honest producer has been making tracks for years honing his craft in the studio mostly releasing tracks as a quick look at his voluminous discogs page will confirm: dude is a studio hound with hardly enough labels to house his prodigious output ( arrival of his ellum audio imprint last year almost seemed long overdue ) took a backseat last year as estornel gigged on the back of his life index album and eventually notched a 5 placement in ras top dj poll but there were gigs throughout the year and none of them bigger than the live set presented with cd showcases estornels performance at the closing party for sven vaths weekly white isle shindig and things kick off from almost the first second which samples mutabarukas contribution to bobby konders track of the same name starts like a breakdown and ratchets things up until the kick drum and the full bassline arrive at the same moment and provide relief you can almost imagine the crowd at amnesias arms rising in unison mutabaruka seems somewhat important here given the success of s housier (and as a result poppier) leanings it seems like there are more vocals than you might imagine a live set to have contained say four years ago most of the tracks contain a vocal of some description to hold onto whether it be mutabaruka pitched down repeating words like jazzercise and house or just disembodied snatches of voices syncopating against the pounding beat in fact at times its hard to say whether youre listening to or (indeed two tracks make it on the mix and the ) thats not much of a problem funkiness that has propelled estornels tracks over the past 24 months or so is the same no matter which name theyve been under has a dark heart but its bassline still slithers same for sound design is busy in the same way as his dumb unit and treibstoff 12 inches without sacrificing its swing minimal techno or crosstown house: it all just sounds like eric estornel
latest project from berlin-based scot danny berman (best known for his house productions as red rackem) is a band that riffs on the cross-pollination of post-punk disco and euro electro which inspired a brief period of wild creativity in york circa 1979 making like the lost link between liquid liquid and lizzy mercier descloux bermans collective which includes members of crazy p and the vocalist city hayes lovingly recreate an era in which improbably you could have caught grandmaster flash esg and clash all playing on the same downtown manhattan club bill trouble is weve been here before and not just in 1980 between 2000 and 2006 a slew of reissues from the label ze and compilations such as gommas anti-ny and struts disco not disco examined that period forensically inspiring a new generation to fuse dance music and scratchy art-rock labels like output and dfa and bands as diverse as colder young pony club spektrum and franz ferdinand were all invigorated by the idea of playing funk like punks t was pivotal moment in recent music history six years on what do add not a lot at its best punk-funk of whatever vintage is raw and intense music teetering if only in a faux-naif way on the brink of collapse berman however (like trevor jacksons playgroup who pulled it off with far greater playfulness) seems to be more interested in that point where ny art-funk went overground its deviant spirit seeping into pop/rock albums made by grace jones tom tom club and even the rolling stones at the legendary compass point studios in the bahamas was mixed on a vintage desk used on both public mage limiteds metal box and phil collins n air tonight which is a neat pointer to its good and bad sides its yin and its awful 80s yacht-rock yang at its best in the nagging insidious and jittery stand-out create a pleasantly dank atmosphere: a sonically strung-out world of troubled nightlife creatures for whom clubland is an existential crisis elsewhere though punk gives way to polite jazz-funk is more gilles peterson than gang of four and ugly retro flourishes is curiously noisy but you may struggle to get past its cheesy balearic pianos and its attempt to bring back the slap bass likewise and are disfigured by the sort of squally fm rock axe work that in a sane world would be sealed in lead and buried at sea forever
the title of s latest ep is relevant to the two pieces of music within oth show a fetishism for repetition or as he calls it static structure problem is without being relatively unique or timbrally rich like acid the repeated elements quickly become tiresome the samples in fulfil neither of these requirements; youll swear youve heard the tech house-style hats and claps before with no real melody to speak of zimmermann keeps things moving by playing with the basic elements: delaying the claps into barely perceptible build-ups changing note lengths or filtering the bass on the -side multi employs similar tactics right down to the generic percussion this time however miniscule blips ping-pong their way across the spectrum occasionally gaining comet-like tails essentially both tracks are throwbacks to the mnml of yesteryear a style most of us seem happy to leave in the past

ann arbor fixture todd s shapeshifting abilities are well-documented on this three-tracker for kentucky label he traverses various styles of off-kilter house with characteristic aplomb moves from focused and succinct to woozy and elongated with the title track being by a clear distance the most floor-geared of the bunch a pounding kick sets the tone and bouncing pianos a legowelt-ish analogue synth line and a call-to-arms vocal soon complete a deliriously funky brew occupies the ground between those two moods with the enlivening effects of layers of jaunty keys and effects offset by lugubrious bass and drums the nine-minute november meanwhile goes for an aquatic jazzy feel a lingering almost ambient workout it pairs clip-clop percussion with atmospheric bass and keys bringing a cloud-gazing close to a package that starts in peak-time mode
like his fellow workshop affiliate kassem mosse s previous tracks on instra:mentals eps have been mechanical sleepwalks fatigued drum machines dragging themselves to the finish line which is why the german producers second release for the imprint comes as a palate cleanser: revs up with the usual flattened splat of the snares but the bassline is a playful musical thing the track sounds jovial as much as can anyway and as it rolls along it collects countermelodies and vocal wails until its a jiggling mass of catchy motifs and driving percussion the two flipsides dont quite share the melodic buoyancy but theyre bouncy regardless hobbles on an unsightly blend of bleeps and smeared chords and s typical games with reverb and delay blur the lines into a psychedelic haze less alienating is the most familiar track and while its nothing new it comes as a reassuring close to a strange ep faintly industrial loops and synthesized strings coat the backdrop sealed in by a warm cloud of sub-bass all topped off with lightly jazzy keys that strike a chord somewhere between inviting and coldly mechanistic which is something you could say for the whole ep really
aka andrew macpherson hails from the same fertile funked-up montreal hip-hop scene as lunice and sixtoo/prison garde (the three also produce together as nouveau palais) but despite earning a sizable local cult his recording career has been in gestation the longest of the trio here he finally makes his debut on glasgow funk institution a suitable home for his smooth liquid soul paints macpherson as an artist working in that crowded field of filtered funk nostalgia compression-as-retrospection though his production and songwriting feels more informed by modern r b than the usual 80s touchstones makes for a grandiose intro with its glossy chord vamps and indeterminate stomp but the real show begins with the fantastic s the other thing about : dude can sing his angelic but processed voice shouts over a compressed squirm but the chorus is all crystal-clear croon lost somewhere in the nether-regions of straight-up r b and bass music as much as busy production works in his favour highlight for mellows out with gently lashing arpeggios and a slinky garage beat: his vocals are emphasized and laid out in the open and the songs subtle sepalcurean pulse prioritizes sensuality over velocity is a fine debut for a producer who has been waiting far too long for his close-up but its a flattering one mincing r b with dance music and bolstering it all with his strong and soulful vocals is a unique talent in a very overcrowded scene

a new label helmed by qu cohort kicks off with a perversely slight but thrillingly schizophrenic release filled with four tracks all of them raw s is house reduced to a murmur a blippy bassline (just this side of the slap bass style favored by dudes who move their necks a lot when they play) tapped out almost as an afterthought some spare clacks and a bit of adenoidal synth all thin and wispy in the distance qus follows with not much more though the few parts in it are made to glide and bounce from side to side especially the desiccated drum sounds panned from left to right and back again res an almost psychedelic sparseness to the first two tracks and then a definitely psychedelic psychedelic ness to the other two that follow both by and in the up the energy and sense of sinister edge runs an extremely squishy and almost atomized acid line over a steady house stomp with static electricity hi hats over top and some inscrutable tribal vocals caterwauling in the middle in the is slower but more insistent the whole thing singed and still smoldering after whatever happened to make the situation so a ghostly voice dripping in echo makes you wonder as it repeats over and over after that we clean the kitchen
rmon bazile keeps some good company his debut single as was released by chez damier and ron trents prescription label and soon after jus-ed also released an early single when bazile set up his own label deepblak he introduced the world to the brilliance of eric douglas porters work as frikan sciences but where frikan sciences suggests a space where house broken beat hip-hop and spiritual jazz all swing together is decidedly of the head-down deep house variety res something about baziles fourth album that fails to fulfill the promise of its title (not to mention match its stunning cover art) while his collaborative album with porter sketches of space showed off his cosmic jazz side and the cassette-only ncient tones was more experimental is hardly different from previous records thats not inherently a bad thing but the ponging fx and quickening techno pulse of a track like feel less like striking out on a bold new journey than plunging down a familiar chasm ditto the throbbing menace of which goes even darker for nearly ten minutes things brighten considerably in the albums midsection with the three strongest tracks set in a row has the type of skittering drums that bring to mind frikan sciences but the kicks and rippling keys are wholly baziles own and the slow arc of strings gives the track a dramatic edge pity it fades away before the four-minute mark strings also waft across the moody pads of giving it an elegant sheen that neatly offsets the snares and deep bass quickens the pace again and feels recharged after the two slower tracks with dribbles of melody shooting around the claps finishes with bazile at his most eclectic hiccupping drum pattern (and counterpoint of congas) works well with the resonant floating lonnie liston smith-style chords of m deftly mixes a jittery acid line and a dreamy shimmer to nice effect cooling down the pace s a whole might feel somewhat aimless but its back half is still a worthwhile detour
isnt like many other labels ts stayed at the forefront of uk electronic music for its entire lifetime tracing an erratic but intuitive thread through dubstep uk funky footwork and grime always staying one step ahead of everyone else reflecting how wide its purview has become s tenth anniversary release is mammoth but compartmentalized: four separate compilations each highlighting a dimension of the label with one disc of new tracks and another of old favourites 10 1 showcases its clubbier side f it was hard to classify on their fifth anniversary back in 2009 now its basically impossible new tracks have some things in common: and share trilling chiptune sounds while s and s show off the vaporous textures s been fond of lately this is cold computer music which makes the footwork tracks that come later all the more alluring crews stuttering rhythms fit the labels style but the warmer textures of and feel like the analogue soul inside s digital body nevitably the shadow of the late hangs over these tracks especially the two new bits with him: the frenetic and the topsy turvy as with kode 9s rinse cd the first disc shows how footwork has come to dominate s club impulses older material meanwhile unpacks all the other influences that went into the labels sound immense dread of s still hits like a woodblock to the face just as the wonky lopsided bleep of s still perks up the ears when its unforgettable refrain hits sheer variety is impressive in itself second half which runs through s lopsided boogie t and s grime workouts and ends up at s kwaito masterpiece would make your head spin if it all werent so funky and fun thats another thing about no matter how dark tense or conceptual its releases become its a dance label at heart much of the music on the first disc could be considered experimental but its never stuffy take helixs remix of kode 9s already psychedelic footwork tune this one brings the original to a new level of rhythmic incomprehension but its still thrilling japanese producer gets even weirder with laying down a blizzard of 8 bit synths over cascading rhythms that touch on both drum bass and footwork taking touchstones from familiar genres and refiguring them into something completely new its like a microcosm of the label as a whole
this one has important written all over it; not only is it s first original material since 2009 album ciao but its the 100th release for one of the past half-decades most defining house imprints appropriately enough cements the labels style into something (excuse the pun) picture-perfect and presentable squeezing one of dance musics most colourful characters into the desaturated world of its warmed-over fleshtone chambers hasnt undergone a drastic makeover here; as it turns out hes more sympathetic to crosstowns deep house than you might think earlier sexor -era work is a key reference here case in point: the flipside is a remix of 2004s from the ass by uk producer subb-an and its just about the most archetypal crosstown production imaginable originals excitable fidget is flattened out into a throbbing bass-heavy crawler barked vocals nudging the groove along while the mechanical bassline flails with an antiseptic sterility its exactly the kind of thing that would merely float by in one of subb-ans subtly catchy dj sets droll dry pulse of is built around a similarly punch-drunk swirl its a perfectly capable mix of his electro work and the recent pounding techno of his turbo label the proofs in the stunning heart-in-mouth breakdown ridging the gap between past and present its reinforced with a hypnotically anesthetized bassline that slots it neatly alongside the work of artists like maceo plex of course the montrealers ever-divisive vocals make an appearance this time monotonously bleating lyrics from when doves cry they dont add much other than torpor to the already sleepy melody and hold it back from banging highlight to pleasant tension-builder
jay shepherds label has never been anything less than a reliable outlet for club-ready house and disco what separates it from other labels in the same field though is the craftsmanship as evidenced once again by this new four tracker alongside one of the two rmadillos martin dawson theres a frazzled disco swagger to kind of that you just dont get without really knowing your way round a studio has a prowling bassline that when paired with some almost churchy glowing electric chords and the odd owl noise could easily soundtrack some tripped-out 5 m walk home through the city a stands out for the various machine noises that wire it up: some are fuzzy and glow-white hot some are bendy metal bars and some twinkle like fairy dust dexterous production like that is hard not to admire and maybe this pair know that because 3k is slowed to a crawl and loaded with even more beguiling noises for you to wonder at: panning yelps zipping whooshes and laboured chords colour the airwaves with a measured precision they also make you want to dance of course which is just as important
new orleans native has been djing professionally for over 14 years with his upcoming release entitled about to drop on piliavin and zimbardo s he will undoubtedly be making a name for himself on the production circuit as well is a darker toned progressive track and while it s debatable as to whether or not the three versions of the production will appeal to dj s outside of the tribal/progressive scene the excellent quality and composition of the song is undeniable the original version is the best of the three it features a vocal echoing throughout the track in a voice that can best be described as deliciously evil another vocal runs throughout the production creating a somewhat dubby undertone the bass line rides low over a pounding kick drum as various thunderous synth lines and effects fade in and out of the mix first up on the flip side is the kingkade remix this remix is definitely a dance floor stormer even if it s hard to say that there is anything new going on in terms of the trancey bass line and somewhat predictable progression disregarding originality kingkade know how to keep a club packed and the dance floor sweating this remix is no exception finally there is the victor stereo remix which adds a tech house flavor to the original version the bass line on this interpretation of the track definitely reaches more toward house influences yet maintains the dark voice crowing over a looped vocal sample and delayed synth note what makes a release worth picking up is how each version takes similar elements from the original yet creates entirely different finished products in terms of a completed track all three versions clearly stand on their own and could arguably be played in the same night without one noticing that they are of the same title (barring of course the growling vocal of the song s name really the only giveaway) has released some impressive vinyl in their short existence and s is no exception expect great things to come from both the producer the remixers and the label if is indeed any indication of what lies ahead
james last the late easy-listening singer and bandleader from germany was renowned for making happy music as edges towards its 50th release with debutant id say prins thomass label has done a lot to earn the same distinction every note of chrome-finished arpeggio and gentle glockenspiel chime on todd terjes eurodans is as giddy as the first hour of a summer holiday; when the fat disco drums and laser melodies of fellow norwegians blackbelt andersen and yvind morken fall short of euphoria they happily land on contentment likewise is a lot of fun but it works hard to maintain its easygoing demeanour the title track mines the generous electro-funk and r b of west coast boogie as does a lean punchy house track pushed along by slap bass cowbells and synth notes that bounce off the beat like super mario gets two remixes both of which tease out a different mood from the source material chmmr reduces to an austere funk jam with a rubbery bassline credited here as dj birger dj burgers drip-drop skin percussion and rearranged synth line simmers down the original too but only slightly where sounds as if its reveling in a moment of joy dj burgers remix captures the anticipation of it
cold spring fault less th s debut album for warp had plenty going for it namely sensitive instrumentation and songcraft but overall it felt slightly anaemic lacking the edge and hypnotic tension that made crooks and lovers so easy to love the two main exceptions were the songs that featured king krule meter pale ne and r archy marshalls croaked howl stood out against the wistful instruments and soft-focus electronics r gets remixed three times here with varying success lee s version sounds like the original crusted with old sediment his now-signature haunted electronics replacing the live drums and pained vocals s remix is amorphous and evocative but it seems a shame to gut the track of its emotional core kyle s dvo dub version also loses the vocal in favour of a deep groove but it feels like a slightly awkward marriage of styles onemans remix keeps the vocal part intact but dilutes the electronics so that jae (who also features on the track) and king krules downbeat deliveries are the focal points dj turns in the best remix reworking into a colourful house jam he wisely includes the vocals only five minutes in his sparing application of the hook rendering it more affecting than the original

this double sided split release is the debut for and urridges new label cum party series the idea says urridge is to provide an outlet for a particular brand of smooth deep but uplifting techy house music whether it be on record or over a series of late afternoon shingdigs which urridge has arranged in nyc and l over the past summer and beyond udioflys sunrise jogs along on a bed of tribal percussion spanking kick drums urgent synth swells and a theatrical voice imploring do you hate to be asked what things mean slinking up against it is the label owners its predictably epic; a slightly eerie ten minute long sensual erotic dream of a tune its like some twisted victorian music box sat on top of ryuichi sakamoto style synths complete with gentle pads and a theremin interlude not a combination you hear every day which perhaps explains why it sounds so fresh deep and unashamedly thrillingly so
just as reemerged this year label boss mark barrott moved to the forefront as a producer in march he dropped an ep as the sonic esthetic a release that spanned from the slow acidic rumble mendicant dventures to the fluttery neo-kosmische the paradol chamber but now returning uncredited for barrotts unleashed the kind sandy-haired beach anthems that might have been a mission statement for the label had they arrived back in 2009 silky pads coast over beardo flute melodies on the excellent it seems to want to submerge itself in the surf and float to the horizon held ashore only by the earthy groove bird songs chirp into a gong-like backdrop before nimms of nd begins its slow ascent into a heady eastern getaway that sounds like a bubble club/lindstr m collaboration is quieter its sprawling guitar astral flutes and synthesizer melody sounding like an alternate soundtrack to de palmas body double its a beautiful and beguiling close to another standout ep for and further pro that one its most intriguing sonic beach bums is its owner
ntwerps ilker soylu has a thing for vinyl-only labels couple of years ago he launched phil a highly collectible imprint known for limited pressings colored wax and a bumpy analog house vibe thats in keeping with the labels birthplace rotterdam now he kicks off a vinyl-only arm of te m his more techno-oriented label with a split ep between himself and his countryman peter horrevorts (he also has a thing for sub-labels: te m has also spawned te msplit te mtomorrow te mone and te mdeep ) the music here is rougher and steelier than phils releases by and large but a similarly murky confused vibe is evident horrevorts arranges vinyl hiss and lo-fi percussion samples into a dry crackling groove that faintly recalls early perlon releases although the squishy production has more in common with bnjmns creative compression tactics; languid synth vamps and horror-film strings keep it from dissolving into dust on philogresz the drums and clipped samples also hint at a minimal heritage while judiciously placed synth melodies recall cobblestone jazz jammy approach s with the -side track the sound of the record is unusual and slightly disorienting with dry clicks pushed high in the mix and bassy reverb sucking at your heels from below but you get the sense that its intentional dont offers a more restrained take on similar ideas with jazzy synth leads melted over hissing snapping drum machine grooves and weird amorphous chords that throw everything further off kilter
writer robertson davies once said: world is full of people whose notion of a satisfactory future is in fact a return to the idealized past and hes right even the most forward-thinking among us will occasionally succumb to the good-old-days syndrome wondering why the world be cant be as it was in some imagined halcyon youth in any artistic endeavor trading in nostalgia can be tricky: how can we pay tribute to the glories of bygone days or at least our romanticized versions of them without turning our back on whats to come his debut album buy ticket take ride the english artist behind the label magic feet doesnt exactly solve that problem nor does he try instead he embraces the past so enthusiastically and so seductively that many people will gladly follow his lead record is a journey through the analog synth-pop landscapes of places like sheffield and downtown new york circa 1980 res a bit of d sseldorf and akron ohio tossed into the mix as well the pulsing opener sounds like a collaboration between early devo and mid-period kraftwerk dare -era human league sets the template for robo-disco tracks like and you half-expect phil oakey and susanne sulley to start trading vocal lines which was previously released on andrew weatheralls bird scarer label takes a slightly darker route into ebm (also previously released on instruments of rapture) slots somewhere between cat stevens was dog a donut and safety dance sans the annoying lyrics ory is the best bobby o-influenced cut ive heard in a while pitch it up a bit close your eyes and just imagine yourself inhaling poppers under the biggest disco ball youve ever seen not every song works quite so well takes the same jackboot rhythm that makes so great and buries it under a fuzzed-out guitar line and a chanted refrain of we want your soul sometimes the broth is spoiled by too many clich s monotone vocal of your sounds like a male response to dominatrix sleeps tonight (though to be fair the tracks electro-funk groove is so slinky that you may not care) best track here is the closer originally released in slightly different form on is it balearic recordings its bubbling acid swooning synths and deep-tuned bass are of-this-millennium in a way that proves bratley is more than a one-trick pony n again if youre as good at your trick as bratley is being a one-trick pony wouldnt be so bad

novamute was key during technos early days releasing landmark records from the likes of plastikman speedy j and luke slater returning after nearly a decade earlier this year its back with an ep from whos currently in the throes of a renaissance besides keeping the ebm flame burning with nitzer ebbs douglas mccarthy fixmers hypnotic techno and trademark sound design has found a home at ostgut ton his second ep for the label landed this summer another quintessential berghain record is another space-themed techno record but its approached in true fixmer form title track is for the dance floor with tough kicks and swirling synth lines its turbulent and high-energy classic fixmer rest of the ep is more adventurous is physical with a relentless buzzing loop that feels like its drilling into you elsewhere sounds are slowly modulated into droopy dips and squelchy peaks throwing chaos into the regimented rhythms is the most abstract track where air escapes from vents and whooshing noises gesture towards some kind of lost in space scenario made all the more dramatic by alarm bells and tense atmospherics

a brooklyn producer and the drummer in yeasayer made his debut on have a killer time in 2013 with the pretty if underwhelming n1 is a more complete exploration of the same steve reich- and arvo p rt-indebted style its elegiac mood benefitting from being fleshed out across several movements following his grandmothers death the ep was apparently made using field recordings from his grandparents tennessee farm prior to its sale with its drama-laced pads and flickering keys is a more caffeinated take on n1 s title track its s highlight was started on the front porch of the farmhouse during parks final visit there though its very pretty the contrast between deep pools of bass and dynamic keys keeps it from being too dewy-eyed dials back the pads to reveal a relatively spare palette of eastern-sounding keys the winsome title track meanwhile is well executed but inessential incidental music and serves mainly to emphasise the many points of progression elsewhere on the rest of the record a 12-inch-only remix of it by australian producer bell fares better by adding some smooth background propulsion but it struggles to completely break free of the originals slightly mundane feel
one label that seems to be getting good attention of late is institution records and this release here on their imprint by is sure to increase that attention with a very successful remix job done on echofalls shiver coming to mind in particular try to turn the heat on with their original works in time to reflect the original mix does the job quite nicely thank you very much smooth breakbeat patterns flow throughout accompanied by the lush trademark melodic tones of s production sound nice smooth pads help create the smooth aroma of sound that fills the air in this track and it seems to blend very nicely with the other elements of the production on the flip is the interestingly titled dirtydoodoofunk straight outta stronghadia mix don t ask me what that means as i have nfi but all i know is that the production is just as leftfield as the title the beats are not necessarily tougher but the added elements such as the rumbling baselines and scratches help make this a pretty unique interpretation interesting to say the very least but most importantly quite good quite a solid couple of tracks here by and quite a nice overall release from well worth the extra few minutes at the listening post at any good record store
screen recording shave definitely held their own in the last year or so with some solid releases from the likes of chris fortier especially and they look to continue their tradition with a release here from snake sedrick andro 2 original production sin the works here both that should hopefully send you in a good state liquid state is first up and it shows some good form with solid beats early on before moving into some smooth melodic tones the main breakdown early on sees the main melodies go solo introducing the beats and the bouncy baseline to kick in thereafter and take the track to full throttle on the flip there is a noticeable increase in intensity with solid state the baseline rumbles a little more and the mood is set with smooth flowing atmospheric hums the track stays at a smooth pace throughout with no real massive builds not a bad release with the a-side probably shading it marginally
berlin producer michael schwanen keeps busy enough helping run the booking agency omega oz playing in the trio beachcoma producing as that you might figure hes just knocking out the tracks based on this ep thats pretty safely not the case the three originals that make up s first half are meticulously laid out sometimes so smoothly as on the tugging title track that they can slip past you jacks harder not in a back-to-olde-chicago way just surging bass and ringing cowbell to push things along lives up to its moniker somewhat by indulging in wispy filters that hover over the track though the low end digs down so far that everything else floats atop it by definition both remixes of give it a softer focus dave dks version is foggier all around: theres a hesitancy to his three-note bass pulse and flat-four kick that makes the gauzier synths even more relaxed with restrained snapping and shaken percussion like gilt on the musics edges undos mix filters the synths till they undulate like waves and does the same with the handclap-like snares or snare-like handclaps whichever it is john hands in the most confident of the remixes he treats the central synth lines of to a light coating of wah-wah giving the track a dubbed-up feel while still situating it firmly in house terrain

the london-based irish producer came into the spotlight with his 2016 debut roadworks part 1 on funkinevens apron records full of muggy club tools bent out of shape it felt right at home but his next 12-inch for the label was more reflective of the music that fills his long-running nts show this adventurous streak goes even further on s latest release issued through andrew lysters new label is an odd delight reminiscent of powells early tracks disorienting modular frequencies veer in and out of focus as a marauding bassline and knackered new wave drums jostle for attention everything grinds to a near halt several times amplifying the sense of chaos the organs strings and indecipherable vocal snatches in s breakdown evoke 60s sci-fi paranoia suggesting a mystery that goes beyond the title the two b-side tracks show that retains a taste for blown-out hardware jams is the more satisfying tune a concise exercise in gurgling electro pitched somewhere between drexciya and chbb
pick a dj then choose a city it sounds like a previously tried and tested idea for a cd series however before you jump to conclusions let me explain different to the global underground formula the decks the city cd series is actually set in home town of the dj s behind the mix as apposed to selecting a dj flying him/her to an exotic location to perform and basing the cd from that performance volume 1 takes place in new york and is mixed and compiled by irish ex pats marcus dominique who run saturdays at the big apples legendary centro fly club in keeping with the clubs new york house music flavour the 65 minute mix delves into the deeper end of the house music spectrum with offerings from the likes of derrick carter dj sneak hipp-e tony bushwacka chorus by bushwacka is one of the albums standout tunes and helps set the tone for the albums change in pace tony senghore s - hey chica (derrick carter mix) encompasses tougher sounds and along with hipp-e tony s shine see the album peak before dropping back to the deeper house roots an album with a definite prepared set feel to it to catch a moment in time glimpse of the current new york house scene pop this in your stereo shut your eyes and cast your mind to the big apple decks the city is a very true representation of the current sound championed by these two dj s at the moment
theres something very about while the south african producers name labels him a sensitive rocker the title of his eight-track ep reminds us that he makes gqom durbans version of south african house the press release however clarifies that actually makes a style called sgubhu which shares many stylistic parallels with gqom i suspect only scene insiders can truly tell the difference (sgubhu is perhaps a little brighter in tone ) still names one of the tracks so maybe thats the best way to describe sgubhu but is less the future than an alternate reality in which gqom has achieved big-room status it has a trance-like breakdown and a jazzy central melody thats halfway between a guitar and a fender rhodes that may sound tacky but theres a pop quality along with a driving rhythm that makes the track supremely fun you can hear this sense of fun elsewhere like in the flute sound in the near-baroque drama of s strings and the marimba melody of the rave hoover and steel drums on offer light to what can often feel like dark music its exciting to know that this scene is evolving even if it takes a refined ear to hear it
german imprint plastic park sign up greek producer for their seventh release a low-down moody track entitled not over yet from the start a constant 4/4 beat sets the pace while delayed hits disguise a darkened mood lurking in the background gradually a single pad chord works its way in filtering up as percussive elements are added while all the time the bassline provides a steady upbeat groove after a brief drop out of the beat a sublime melody takes over creating a dreamy outlook as in creeps the pads once more and continues to flow over itself till the end the parham dominic remix shifts it up a gear with a fuller chugging bassline and punchy drums along with a smoother hypnotic synthline that develops gradually while energetic percussive rhythms put more of a swing into it its a clean and neat production with a slow unnoticed pace but could do with being less formulaic in its delivery
jacob long and daniel martin-mccormick go back a long way over the past 15 years theyve played together in some half-dozen bands from the respected latter-day dischord act black eyes to more recently a techno duo whose first ep has just arrived on martin-mccormicks label though long has released music on before (namely last years mirage ep ) this new 12-inch marks the first time he and martin-mccormick have ever teamed up in the studio came together over three days last february a time when like many americans long and martin-mccormick were reeling from the eric garner verdict something they say greatly influenced the record new york winter left its mark as well: the duo recorded these tracks while snowed in at martin-mccormicks blindingly cold home studio you can definitely hear this introspective and compellingly bleak reflects the mood a winter afternoon thats gone dark too early two the tracks are ambient ( iniatiate ) three ride sleek techno grooves ( ) all are cast in lovely textures the chords are shimmering the pads icy the kick drums smooth and thick my only complaint about is its political pretensions speaking to juno plus martin-mccormick explained the duos somewhat loaded name this way: even though the music isnt overtly protest music or overtly political these ideas were still important to it so the band was like a sleeper cell given the definition sleeper cell this feels a little dramatic especially coming from the authors such a fine and subtle techno ep

one of the major players in the realm of nu skool breaks chris carter is renowned for his tech-infused and sometimes percussive flavours often standing out from the rest of the pack chris has been associated with various breakbeat labels such as tcr en:vision and botchit scarper and it is with botchit that he puts out his latest mix cd - - with the most blantant use of the breaks pun since krafty kuts slam the breaks on mix series opens up with chris remix of jason sparks im in you featuring the vanity set on vocals its a traditional rave style breaks number - melodic synths rave style female vocals and squalchy acid bass sidled with some hard breakbeats plump beats and fattening basslines feature heavily on jhz mark audios marshmallow with which carter lays down the intro to deekline wizards tribute to old skool acid house tinged with breaks 4x4x4 4x4x4 has a tough housey vibe with killer synth lines and well placed drum fills that command attention on the dancefloor and is featured here in the original botchit breaks 5 version chris brings the rave breaks element back into the mix with his remix of the lawgiverz passion carters remix lays down a rolling techy break while keeping the tweaked up synth melody and feel good female vocals - with carters remix adding some more techy tweaks and stabs to the mix overall from here the mix takes a darker tone beginning with jhz bringing out the dark tear out breakbeats and rumbling bass on azures its tough and should bring out lots of aggression on the dancefloor backdrafts road hog makes good use of industrial sound samples and heavy squelchy acid bass and finally aquasky vs masterblaster end the tear out session with the fart-like basslines on disco biscuit taken from their massive beat the system lp finishing up the mix are two carter tracks the first being xing (most likely pronounced crossing ) - melodic tech breaks with a sample of a sublime jazz tune layered on top - crossing borders between jazz and nu-skool breaks carter then slows down the tempo for the ambient semi circle - showing a little influence from the likes of the orb atmospheric synths minimal beats and textures permeate the entirety of the track leaving the listener feeling a little comatose for me its a really bad way to finish the mix and im finding that im searching for the rewind or (even more so) the stop button if hard techy breaks is your thing then there is definitely something for you in while it is an adequate selection of tough beats and breaks carters mixing ability just doesnt seem to cut it when it comes to the slice with a few poor transitions between tracks - marshmallow to 4x4x4 to hootenanny and whats worse it just leaves you feeling somewhat shortchanged on semi circle on a more positive note as a producer chris beats are worth checking out if the breakbeats released through botchit scarper are your sounds then the lawgiverz bass instinct is worth forking out the cash for tracklisting: 1 jason sparks featuring the vanity set-im in you (chris carter remix) 2 atomic hooligan-6am beigel 3 jhz mark audio-marshmallow 4 deekline wizard-4x4x4 5 soto-hootenanny 6 lawgiverz-passion (chris carter remix) 7 jhz-azures 8 chris carter-echo babylon 9 backdraft-road hog 10 sicknote-strech 11 aquasky vs masterbaster-disco biscuit 12 chris carter-xing 13 chris carter-semi circle

with a new vinyl-only offering from the denver duo of and john tyler sets its stall out confidently and quietly with their first release is a four-track ep from which doesnt so much knock on your door as shuffle unobtrusively onto your front porch and wait for you to stumble over it in some online stores the tracks have names but they werent deemed of sufficient importance to add to either the sleeve or the vinyl itself an introverted approach that carries over to the tracks themselves liveliest of the quartet is undoubtedly but even that is only a shade more than a ponderous murmur its bass lead stumbling around unconfidently overall mood of the ep may be relatively dark but its often lightened with colourful freckles whether its the frog-like grunts of or sinister squelches of its music that has clearly taken time to craft and is proof that you dont need to make noise in order for people to pay attention
tech house is an odd scene because it tries to cross pollinate and unite two strands dance music that tend naturally to gravitate away from one another the headlong speedy rush techno and the slinky warmth house on the other hand tech house has its own very particular aesthetic endless hypnotic grooves and an avoidance the rollercoaster ups and downs that typify most other djs sets connaisseur pretty much epitomizes the modern strain tech house in that the tech part in their equation is minimal techno and the house part is innervisions esque neo deepness for this their first compilation there is one disc new tracks on which the songs fall at various different points along the spectrum from tech to house at the techy end there are some real big peak time tunes s uses a powerful us style bassline married to housey but edgey sounding and paranoid chords to create a very nasty but very dancey combination you could imagine tenaglia playing this in a parallel universe where he was still good takes a more electro y route with but it has a strong jerky appeal biggest tune is probably however and s fast and pounding with pulsing trance bass nagging percussion and a stephan bodzin feel to the production ever it s distinctly sweeter in approach than bodzin with a very direct and very trancey melody taking centre stage at the housier end there are some really idiosyncratic tunes: and s uses an indistinct vocal snippet layered up with bells and s t tones to build up to a trippy oscillating climax s captivating and completely unexpected and might be played dixon if he were feeling experimental and zoexenia s can t is equally unusual with its matthew herbert goes to cologne vibe but perhaps a little less successful as the fascinating intro gives way to a slightly cheesy vocal where the compilation is less successful are the tunes that sit in the middle the spectrum neither one thing nor the other s has a fantastic rolling bassline that you could imagine featuring in a remarc production from but nothing else happens in the track so it can t sustain interest for its entire length s is more successful in that it uses only a few simple elements with bass figuring heavily again and builds effectively to a jacking if not anthemic peak and this leads us to s mix which is the disappointing part this compilation re s such a diverse wealth styles here which could have made for a very varied and interesting set particularly when combined with the connaisseur back catalogue but somehow manages to make all the tunes he chooses sound very similar (and indeed he noticeably avoids the housier side connaisseur which is arguably the more interesting one) mix is frankly not terribly exciting although it might qualify as hypnotic i suspect this is because too much tech house all together can become a bit a gray mush a bit like fusion cuisine one needs to leave nuggets pure house and techno in the dish to make it truly worthy a gourmet s attention in the final analysis the cross fertilisation different styles that connaisseur are purveying clearly gives rise to some great moments but also has the risk becoming a little bland as the mix cd demonstrates

recent releases on have felt especially meditative with label boss peverelist homing in on the quivering dub heart that lies at the core of his music a collaboration between him and outboxxs hodge is no different this one comes in two versions both centered around a dizzy melody thats laced with flimsy synth trails and of course bells whats most striking about the dream sequence mix is that it has a straight kick drum while peverelist and his livity sound crew have been moving ever closer to house its rare to hear it executed quite like this (id chalk this up to hodge ) on this mix everything is ephemeral and threatens to flicker away permanently as the central melody pans in and out and the bells chime ominously the system mix is more like the peverelist we know and love: dub effects are liberally applied the tracks bassline nearly blots out everything else and the drum pattern is broken and tattered it doesnt quite reach the majesty of the dream sequence mix but it doesnt need to its another excellent addition to peverelists discography primitive and futuristic all at once
the imprint from the uk get set to unleash for their next release as the production outfit get set to enter as their name suggests expect some house with a disco feel first up is the peter presta tuff pumpjn mix chunky from the word go the track builds in the first few moments with some crisp driving beats and a deep rumbling baseline the disco filtered vibes soon shine through however and take the track to its peak where it lies for a few minutes and then slowly concludes short and sweet and straight to the point on the flip is the brandon riley cold filtered mix the track also builds with some good drum patterns and not before long a twisted filtered loop takes the track into overdrive in a less subtle way then the a-side did more driving and more intense this remix is but for me it probably edges the a-side which is quite impressive as it is a pretty solid release here by the disco bumbz with both sides definitely not lacking in fun filled disco vibes and driving beats
if faced any doubts after rising to prominence in 07 theyve put them to rest in 08 ir quality control has remained startlingly consistent with their slowly expanding stable of artists churning out slab after slab of the finest dub techno western europe has to offer take for example mark stewart the man behind the moniker; after a flurry of activity earlier in the year that saw him drop the acclaimed metanarrative release the absolutely massive rise 12-inch and deliver the final installment of his long-running warehouse sessions series all before spring managed to hit its stride youd think his hand might start to get a little weak at the controls youd be wrong fter staying quiet for the latter part of 08 stewart closes out the year on a high note with his latest 12-inch for a languid dub techno cut thats part asic channel and part carl craig hits all of the claro hallmarks uilt around a few choice chords swaddled in dense clouds of delay feedback the mix is propped up by a sturdy beat that sounds as if it were recorded through a subterranean tunnel it could easily be a metanarrative outtake on the flip is a different beast altogether taking a more aggressive approach and placing the emphasis firmly on the jacking 4/4 pulse if the was purpose-built for the afterhours come down sees stewart at full-peak intensity giving maurizio and co a run for their money while this might not be the most remarkable thing stewarts ever released as its also far from the weakest showcasing two very different sides of his sound its a fitting closer to a year that has seen him at the top of his game
this is a great piece of old school meets new school breakbeat with deekline throwing everything but the kitchen sink into a groove that should appeal to everyone with dancing feet david elliott supplies the catchy vocal hook with a phat bass line and some beats to do damage underpinning the music dont know about four wheel drive but it certainly feels like a handbrake turn through a pirate radio station its fair to say that no-one sounds quite like deekline at the moment and if youre a fan of the plump djs youll go for this big style
s is by no means the most exotic record awesome tapes from africa has dug up over the years the album doesnt come from a vintage era nor does it make use of non-western instruments or scales produced on fruityloops and first released in 2009 with its roland-style drum hits and splashes of digital synths offers a more contemporary sound still it fits the mission of brian shimkovitzs label: to unearth recordings previously available only in africas cassette culture ishmael abbey got his start as a dj in the ghanaian capital of accra eventually rapping in the languages of twi and ga over his records instrumental breaks soon he was adding live hits from a sampler and a yamaha dd-11 drum pad creating rhythms on the fly this would become a production technique once he started making his own tracks which he did somewhat late in the game at the age of 39 hovering in the vicinity of 140 bpm abbeys tunes are digital interpretations of neo-traditional dance music found around accra namely gome kpanlogo and gyama he replaces the hand-played percussion patterns with precisely programmed drums and those potent rhythms are s principal focus in fact many of the best moments come when abbey strips his productions down to darting sequences of kicks snares claps hi-hats and cowbells the approach is exemplified on and on the albums closer which adds sporadic chants and sparse raps to the tunes rhythmic core on tracks like abbey fleshes out his lively beats with simple melodies using digital woodwinds and midi guitar here as well as call-and-response vocals from his daughter which he often pitches up an octave the title track reveals a darker side in a nod to abbeys detroit techno and chicago acid house influences icy digital synths lace s hypnotic percussion later further explores those western electronic influences slowing down the tempo to lay bouncy synths atop a tom-heavy drum sequence is generally rough around the edges some songs drag on and there are production quirks that stick out particularly a reliance on basic software sounds and the warped chipmunk voice that appears on more than half of the albums nine tracks and yet those same qualities make this a singular collection was popular in its home country when first released and now its inclusion in the awesome tapes from africa catalog brings a vibrant sound to the larger electronic community

and are long established live techno acts their approaches might seem polarised to some: orchestrates a bank of small controllers and portable keyboards while a trio who resemble a rock band on stage use guitars and drums as well as analogue equipment as performers though their styles overlap ive seen swing a synth like a fretboard; on the other hand can play with reserved hypnotic precision like a drum machines circuitry made flesh both remixes here are amped up versions of the originals whats surprising is that it wasnt only who turned the dial clockwise: s remix of a track from s under construction album swaps the originals icy broken beat for a metronomic 4/4 smack airy synths and scraps of modular sound orbit and expand around a crunchy electronic bassline like a cloud of gas it swells euphorically before the song gently reverts back to its bare rhythm s overhaul of is a growling thumping house record splashed in organs and atmospheric synth it submerges the originals brighter chords in a milky formula of reverb and delay but otherwise closely matches the original mood whatever their creators differences both tracks share an energy that dance floors will connect with easily

following up their amazing party-breaks-meets-ragga beats bobz mix cd offer up a new full length artist album for (formerly breaks) is the title track to their fifth album release and once again the zone fuse together sounds of ragga dub and dancehall with a breakbeat outlook oh and throw in a few surprises as well original mix the original tune incorporates a percussive breakbeat with a deep dubby bassline echoey keyboard stabs and a typical off-beat piano riff that weve come to expect from reggae the break switches to a 2-steppy dancehall beat during the second verse dropping a sub-smashing bassline to wobble the speakers vocals are taken care of vocalist earl 16 as he tells a story about how much the small island of jamaica has offered to modern music and during the chorus hes accompanied by a sweet trumpet riff a spooky hammond and a middle eastern melody its definitely a winner for summer and features proper use of instrumentation and musicality king at the controls mix king at the controls control de worl on a much darker tone is the remix done by beefing up the sub-bass line and adding in new variations to the melody this time the vocals of earl 16 are replaced by echoed stabs while the rhythm concentrates on a looping break electro hooks and harder drum breaks brothers bud mix this mix is a winner and definitely my personal favourite brothers bud utilise a faster and more uplifting breakbeat with more than enough energy to ignite any dancefloor the vocals are kept intact and for good reason - theyre catchy and add flavour to the song the middle eastern melody plays a bigger part in the tune accompanying earl 16 during the verses and the trumpet licks play their bigger part during the chorus in the middle brothers bud drop a wicked b-boy electro breakdown featuring a harpsichord doing a solo on a cheeky mozart learns how to b-boy tip mafiatone mix member and wicked producer in his own right mafiatone represents with his own take which leans towards 2-step breaks with a heavily syncopated drum break adding a new dimension to the rhythm earl 16s original vocals are chopped up and a gruff ragga mc spits out new lyrics to suit the new beat an echoey hook is layered over the top and the bassline is given a noticable wobble to shake the subs
sometimes bringing biographical information into the picture when discussing music is merely a narrative crutch but in the case of young italian producer its hard to resist making assumptions apparently growing up on a steady diet of r b and hip-hop herve ats corti discovered idm and set to work with his laptop music on his intriguing debut album easily betrays all of that ful deep house rendered with an ambitious and particularly amateurish hand s first album on bosconis extra virgin sub-label is an occasionally enchanting effort by a promising novice is a watercolour portrait of blurry sedate deep house but its a kind of house where the tracks throb with their entire bodies rather than pivot on the weight of the kick drum part of that is by design: built up heavily from samples tracks like and almost owe as much to the la weirdo-hip-hop tradition as any number of deep house touchstones chords become twisted up in the heaving structures with melodies manifesting like drops of humidity on the glassy surface is vaguely psychedelic and soporifically-paced giving it an ephemeral and ethereal feel only underlined by the ghostly vocal samples often utilizes aesthetic comes to a head on mid-album centrepiece where the jaunty beat skips like a dirty record and corti goes wild on the decibel fluctuations creating a disorienting vacuum that his music seems to disappear into momentarily before popping back out as good as new that last trick is perfectly indicative of cortis scrappy irreverent spirit: on several other tracks he pulls the levels down to zero and back up again obscuring beats and leaving bits and pieces of melodies unfinished if it sounds neat at first its ultimately frustrating and annoying like a toddler fascinated by the volume knob on a stereo receiver its the work of an artist whos still learning his craft still learning the boundaries of taste but his seeming disregard for convention also leads to some genuinely stunning music pulls the rug out from under the luxurious dubby swell for eight minutes of pleasant pulse like hollowed out slowed-down trance overlaid with a new-agey monologue that sounds like it was taken off some relaxation tape i cant really decide if its brilliant or hopelessly cheesy (like a lot of ) but its hard not to fall into those lush supple homemade grooves anyway
s immensely long overdue album has been more hyped than a tyson comeback fight once proclaimed the son of god it is clear to see why an album from such a prominent figure in dance music would be so drooled over especially considering the fact that he has called upon the help of producers such as james holden junkie xl charlie may just to name a few since his early origins has always been a musical dj/producer preferring melodies and rhythm in his work an approach that has given a magical aura in the rare times that he steps up to the decks the magic has certainly rubbed off in this album and following from impressive productions in the past like arkham asylum and xpander his modern production work although quite different in it s approach certainly reflects what he has achieved in his illustrious career after a numerous amounts of listens to this album what will strike you is that it s not a normal track by track album more a voyage from start to finish mixed and produced to perfection not one stone in the making of this album has been left unturned so as a collective whole this album is nothing short of brilliant individually it goes a little like this: is a short and soothing welcoming creating the right atmosphere with simple and subtle effects continues the flowing vibe with it s eerie melody building into a momentary sweeping array of strings gives the album its first beat as such with subtle synths and floating jingles building the album slowly but ever so smoothly is a personal highlight of the album encompassing a slightly more up tempo beat with a churning baseline overridden with a looped guitar synth and elevating melodies pure genius sheds a dirtier smudge on the album with a screeching baseline and quirky drum patterns while maintaining a higher end provides a bigger beat with swirling effects probably the toughest the album gets in the entire duration bolieroom follows in a similar fashion with some more break beats topped with twisted and tangled electro funk sounding synths building into a melodic breakdown deep into the track clearly has the influence of james holden giving lend of his trademark roaring baselines and tingling melodies over a more traditional 4/4 time signature takes the journey back to its roots by giving the concluding chapters of the album a break before the grand finale losing the drums bringing the atmosphere levels up a notch to a climatic flow of delayed melodies to a new dawning so to speak this is quite simply a beautiful piece of work is a more dance floor friendly piece with a pretty standard kick with hats jumpy baseline and bouncing synths the album concludes with the brilliant flowing chords with a masterful drum pattern pursued by a trademark melodic arrangement ending with exquisite strings some may think this album is revolutionary some may think its ordinary i think it s neither quite simply put it s a collection of beautiful music from the heart of this album evokes very similar feelings to those you may have after one of s memorable sets feelings of joy happiness but above all feelings that put a smile on your face classically trained musician dj and producer tom middleton once said in a seminar that the three key elements to a piece of music are melody harmony and rhythm they are three key elements that are featured in abundance with s
s journey from digital to vinyl has been a slow and patient one however seems like the perfect year-zero for their move into wax hauls digital releases have been solid but this release gives the impression that the label has learned a lot and is moving forward with a deliberate plan garish art aside the partnership of callander and tornado on the a-side is an obvious reflection of hauls melbourne charter and while alexkid is no australian his contribution offers an interesting contrast as well is one of callanders more enjoyable productions but not because its necessarily easy or funky with so many disparate elements the arrangement is incredibly intriguing and the stabbing kick drum is barely able to rein in the sounds shooting off in every direction tornado takes callanders beats ambles through a cosmic introduction and lets loose with a groove of his own crafting with so much material to work with tw has done well not to get carried away alexkid styles an immediately upbeat track but it fails to go anywhere without the daring of the original or the narrative of tws remix the -side seems more like a tool than a track the venture into vinyl will definitely grant haul a new level of credibility locally and internationally its not a 12-inch that will blow you away but its production alludes to a promising future

hails from graz ustria i dont know much about graz other than the fact its also the home of disko404 the label founded in part by himself the house producer has a history of leaning towards the jazzy side of things which continues with his labels second release though here its infused with a gently swung garage slink the result is something that doesnt sound out of place within the rapidly expanding uk underground particularly where it crosses over into glossier deep house territory the jaunty bears resemblance to uk breakthrough star huxley as disembodied voices chatter to each other in clipped half-syllables would be bordering on fluff were it not for the tracks deceptively massive bassline is more willing to take on a few scuff marks a boisterous take on speed garage with scatting vocals and grungy lfo blasts eating away at the skittery rhythm bristolian conjurer bass pulls things back to about 132 bpm but capitalizes on its dubstep potential for his remix in his hands becomes a staggering mutant of horn stabs pained lfo and incredible waves of quaking sub mj cole having a bad day
whole is greater than the sum of its parts a clich but one that aptly describes mark osullivans s from a long country apparently inspired by osullivans impending fatherhood as well as an interest in gaelic its an engaging electronic selection a concept album that doesnt seek refuge in pomposity but on the contrary takes you places without sounding formulaic leads us in gently but firmly a bass kick and a plucked string marching through an orchestrated backdrop with a tightly coiled percussive break to keep things under scrutiny warm squelch and analogue synth funk of is the opposite; its a simple groove that would work well with a well-chosen vocal things start building with which increases the momentum and the depth but runs aground on the evocatively named steam strings feature heavily on this record and nowhere more so than on a track that calls to mind a madrigal-playing string quartet its a piece that in its melancholic restraint hints at the disorder to come meanwhile is a slam dance in the eye of the storm with a bleak vocal repeated under a barrage of low-end filth mines a similar vein at a higher seam while idub cools things down with a portentously optimistic arrangement maybe its just me but the squelches and squeals of would have likely sounded better earlier in the sequence (if sequence is at all important here) album does end on a high though with which contains echoes of some of the other tracks but builds on them to create a euphoric march across the steppes recalling the heyday of mid-90s techno in feel and intent osullivan has crafted an inspired blend of the fragile and funky s from a long country speaks for itself without needing any specific context; osullivans subtlety is evident throughout on what is on the one hand deceptively simple and on the other unerringly complex a very accomplished piece of work
one year three albums and a few aliases later what else does bjarki have to say by the looks of bbbbbb the label he co-launched in february the icelandic producer is en route to something unrulier than before on nina kravizs label bjarki has nailed breakbeat idm and techno but where those records were often murky and meditative bjarkis latest 12-inch as takes a wilder approach the ep begins with 4 and an alice in wonderland reference what if i should fall right through the earth and come out the other side where people walk upside down she asks mid-sentence alice gets incinerated by breaks at the mid-point the track veers from moody breakbeats to a glitchy meltdown is less chaotic but still scraggly with metallic chords fluctuating bass and a skippy sequence that sounds like its made from suction cups the melody on is a total brain pleaser adding a tingling sensation to the shadowy techno below and end the ep in a more spacious manner the former is spectral and creaking while the latter is warm and psychedelic another project another win for bjarki

martin heinze k has gathered praise from unlikely circles of the electronic music scene his glitchy but floor-friendly drum bass has appealed to various sections of a fragmented drum bass scene as well as receiving compliments from various leftfield and eclectic electronic music purveyors this year he signed to the hospital sub label a move that is sure to bring his experimental drum bass outings more exposure this release features two comically named cuts in s trademarked style the title track sets things of with a strong electro-sounding beat and glitchy clicks and crackle peppered around a tech synth line reminiscent of lauded scottish drum bass duo konflict ll this is woven around a chest punishing sub-bass has a similar electro tinge here the beat and the bass line compete for the listeners attention and its easy to get caught up in the rhythmical complexity of both elements which morph throughout the track ut while s edits and cut-ups might be hard to get your head around on first listen the groove is apparent to the rest of your body from the moment the first beat hits creating inventive and dance floor-friendly drum bass is no small feat in s appreciation for the rhythmical cut-ups of the so-called drumfunk scene taken together with his glitch and idm influences end up being something like a futurist take on the mid-90s jump-up drum bass sound of ristol in that respect his wide appeal isnt surprising at all
three releases in with new yorks and its clear that were just beginning to see what hes capable of doing with stony sampling prior releases have showcased dense effected loops that forgo easy grooving in favor of sheer stupefaction and with he spikes this formula with bits of rupture these house tracks bulge at the seams acknowledging the pleasure of the loop while pushing back against its regularity even the relatively straightforward a steppers groove built around scraps of barry whites im gonna love you just a little bit baby cant keep itself together as the samples trip in and out of time and the drums knock around with unquantized indifference the sleeve notes say these are live recordings and its true that they sound as if half-composed and half-djed is the real achievement of this combination even though it sounds like a dj gleefully clearing a dance floor it begins as a jerky rhythm resembling an old hotflush release but gets subsumed by a backwards vocal sample after banishing every element michael jacksons voice snaps into focus and carries the track to its echoey conclusion is just as bent on confusing the listener: its snares say jack but its low-end is so distant that its difficult to distinguish kick drum from bassline creating more atmosphere than propulsion the title track a deep roller with no sense of mischief about it is the reward for s taxing aspects those who see as being concerned more with soulful fuckery than moving a crowd might consult the b1 before jumping to conclusions the ep displays a healthy skepticism of the sometimes transient pleasures to be found in repetition but this one shows that is as susceptible to carefree grooves as the rest of us
much like the title of kerri chandlers a basement a red light a feelin compilations colin mcbeans approach to house music holds that you only need the most basic ingredients as long as you get that last part right even when he deals with little more than a kick drum and a bassline his music produced as mr g is always infused with feeling and not just giddy escapist euphoria either: his last album personal momentz and 2012s state of flux were inspired by the death of his father and close friend lev van delden respectively it gave the records as much emotional depth as they had dance floor punch in contrast night on town is as the title suggests purely about the club meaning it doesnt have the same weight its a slimmer collection of eight tracks which feels more like six when you consider is under two minutes and sounds like the bonus beats that wouldve been wedged into the end of a double pack in fact much of night on town couldve been b-sides for the great singles mcbean prolifically released on labels like running back and dungeon meat it all never comes together as a cohesive album and although his music has always made a virtue of simplicity many tracks though far from awful come off as sketch-like and unfinished rattling percussion and viscous dub bassline of seem to wander through an urban jungle but they never arrive at a destination has a similar problem letting its ebm-style grind stick to one place rather than gallop on mcbeans trademark grooves res still some solid if unspectacular stuff here such as the menacing bassline of (gs producer has retained his rough analogue edges: works like a steam-powered jack track and actually sounds like a piston vocal loops that brought soul to some of his best work ( song for my cantor and angels (ascending) ) are gone however and so is that ineffable touch that ensured mcbeans tunes were funky and not just functional is the closest thing to a classic mr g track here but even it doesnt make up for a flat album
next up on is a 2 tracker from a finnish based production outfit believer bangs its way in the early stages as furious electro rhythms march alongside a fast paced drum beat soon enough the epic trance synths soon make their appearance in a melodic form but soon make the path clear for a smooth stringy breakdown midway in not for long though as the synths gain in impact and take the track to peak time highs on the flip is thunderous kicks and stabbing pads of savannah the tempo is at a high with this track as well as it progresses with a mid 90 s-esque acidic synth pattern the string breakdown occurs midway through giving the production a well earned break as it is pretty much high octane stuff throughout not bad but not all that awe inspiring a release for it appears that they have lost their way slightly with this release
theres not a techno equivalent of the reinheitsgebot the strict purity laws for ingredients once laid down for germanys brewers if there was one s now available on digital after a vinyl release last year would likely bear such a stamp such purity is obviously tough to achieve as this is the new york-raised detroit residents first ep since his ur debut the brasilia ep back in 2008 flash it seems is as frequent as the olympics the title track is a rollicking tech funk express train with a quicksilver live bass running along its length classic fairground-style synths spanking stabs and melodies that spiral into the atmosphere and float back down again is an altogether simpler affair harsher too with its chattering hi-hats latin conga underpinnings and twitchy percussive string phrases bringing up the rear are the military drums heavily-filtered native merican chants and squelchy rave keys that are chief weapons stripped back high-spirited and honest itll be too straightforward for some but its difficult not to be won over by the exuberant funkiness of it all
when jamie teasdales solo project emerged out of ashes of dubstep pioneers vexd it was an unabashedly colourful sort of dubstep then when jamie vexd morphed into those edges got softer and with this years videowave ep y threatened to melt away completely leaving behind gaseous gasps of melody this is e r that s debut album emerges from ano r rebirth for an already chameleonic producer while it shares synth preoccupation of previous material owes nothing to dubstep instead modeling itself after 80s synth music indeed from moment album begins its gentle ascent with its clear that were not in london anymore the regal synth scales are weighed down with a weary kick drum and track fades into where staggering thumps are buffeted by warm gusts of machine love the contrast between heavy and hollow with wandering intransigence of synths is one of albums most attractive dimensions outside of film-calibre melodies mselves the downright cinematic turns on a track like flood are troubled by stuttering snares that sketch out borders around it mselves clashing with a lurching kick that gives song its semblance of forward motion: it makes tense moments tenser and gut-wrenching more visceral the drums glitch and jump off on footwork tangents ( ) or mutant hip-hop scales ( ) on only constant being nervous speed with which y twitch theres nothing even close to a median bpm but every track feels like its feeding off some well of tireless uptempo energy percussion is rarely main focus but those tracks where drums do dominate like restless suite or fidgety funk of are welcome anomalies grasping points for those who might not o rwise cotton onto albums preference for sweeping grandeur this might be sci-fi music especially sounds like something out of a fictionalized dystopian world but no matter how wrapped up in those futurist tropes it gets its always bogged even fur r down by decidedly human regret and loneliness this is melancholic music and those rare peeks at humanity resonate through cold metallic structures almost uncomfortably it happens mid-way through album with a canny rework of carly simons why when not coming back vocal filters through chugging flanger its enough to make you do a double take its an album made up of familiar elements but what makes it so engrossing is how it twists m into something alien and unique: this is more than just vangelis goes footwork as one ra commenter put it its just jamie teasdale an already accomplished producer freely chasing his inspiration and coming out o r end with near genius in process
sometimes a track that is destined for one market can have a massive crossover appeal in another this is exactly the case with this release on records by london artists absolutely canned by the likes of sasha in particular this release provided many a peaktime moment emotional landscape on the a-side was the particular track that caused the most fuss a culmination of screeching sounds intertwined with a heavy baseline builds the track up leading into the introduction of vocal snippets taken from bjork that peak at the breakdown while sounds filter in and out the rattling drums build until the kick and heavy baseline enters yet again taking the track out while the vocal still floats in the background hammer tongs on the flip was almost the forgotten part of this release but for the techno fans that like their beats quite hard and pounding then it will definitely appeal the pace is furious with the drums rattling alongside a filtered vocal sample sounds come into the production deeper in creating a pulsating soundscape quite a good debut release for and a release that has certainly put them on the map thanks to the great support this release has received
the 17th release on comes from tim scott and vocalist danielle gillieron under the guise of this release don t stop comes with a gold digger mix and vocal mix to please those who like their vocals and those who prefer it left out on the a-side is the dubbed gold digger mix it s a chunky progressive record that relies on electro influenced stabs and a tribal drumbeat as well as deep and subtle baseline that gives the track a smooth and not too obvious groove it s a pretty impressive heads down track that only uses slight vocal lines the original vocal mix on the flip however is definitely one for the ladies as they say a pretty solid musical affair with tight drums and minimal baseline work the vocal does a lot of the work from pretty early on a breakdown midway sees some high toned synths enter while the electro stabs gain intensity and from here on the track hits its peak as the beats come roaring back in a pretty solid release that doesn t amaze but is far from bad either a pretty good vocal helps things along and on that note should really help this release

haven t put a foot wrong since they put out their debut single twelve months ago last month s doozer ep on frankie rec is getting lots of playlist action while this their second ep on swiss label should guarantee that if djs arent playing now they will be soon the ep is a genre-hopping exciting ride into funk is a minimal track that s irresistibly quirky and full of groove and it should appeal to m_nus fans while is forgive me floppy funk with thudding drums and a big vonstroke-esque glitchy electro hook the best is on the flip though is more organic sounding with live drums and a jaw-dropping live bassline with its the amusing is to boys what horses are to girls vocal its difficult not to love this lastly is which is probably the weakest track but that s no issue when everything on the four-tracker is gold a harder electro-tinged piece with some glitch and bleep on another 12-inch it may have fared better but comparatively speaking it doesnt cut the mustard this is a winner for morris audio subsidiary and it should garner many new friends on myspace

ian hodgsons moon wiring club and jim jupps elbury poly are distinct over an intimidating number of albums hodgson has explored weirdo electronics while maintaining a perverted command of the dance floor jupp has kept within the parameters of repurposed 60s and 70s library music producing a different sort of kaleidoscopic listening experience through records laden with synths and otherworldly melodies nd yet the two projects share uncanny similarities y each represent alternate realities with their own backstories psychogeography and visual identities when you listen to a moon wiring club or elbury poly album you pack up your things and leave the present pair first collaborated back in 2010 with youth nd recreation a two-track drift between their respective worlds that came out through s 7-inch series this reunion is for a different 7-inch series other voices evokes caretakers 1999 lp selected memories from haunted allroom ut where caretakers world is dreary terrifying and decaying is luminous and foolishly fun its cheeky like luke viberts wagon christ project with bizarre samples and a silly ending is more serious finding a sweet spot between new age serenity and a last call to sway on the dance floor samples swim among the synth wash as lethargic machines reel out a rhythm
s rad velc ep does the rare thing of being utilitarian and fun at the same time and it also has a bit of something for everyone is probably the screwiest of the lot with an off-kilter beat designed to be noticeably strange but not overpowering enough to throw you off its more pleasantly quirky the kind of subversive techno one should expect from a former ai records affiliate there are more subtle perversions going on behind and the way teases his little displacements a few additional bass hits here a ripple of crystalline chords there helps reset the functionality of his forms finishes the ep on a dour and thundery note with dredging bass spikes of synths and a sense of drama all around

as a remixer you cant ask for much better source material than s piano live drumming digital bits; in short character theres lots to play around with and infines open-minded approach has ensured that an unlikely cast of characters turn up to do so minimal godfather robert is first and hes in an ebullient mood slicing the original into constituent bits that only make complete sense once the kick drum enters into the fray s more than happy to let the piano do the lion share of the work here and as a result the mood is perhaps most reminiscent of his oft forgotten peacefrog releases omega man this aint; dont be surprised to hear this the next time you see luciano play youd expect such melody from mondkopf who fits neatly into the emo electronica box of infines multifaceted interests his remake sounds a bit like what you imagine nathan fake would do with slathering the original piano line in layers of colorful synths a dreamy reverie thats only briefly interrupted by the almost industrial edge the drums take in its final third wareika maintain the sunny vibe but allow you to breathe deeply instead of smothering you in it the track doesnt hold a candle to much of their original material which seems looser in comparison ut as lazy sunday techno goes itll get you by fine
hough only exists supposedly in the minds of damon albarn and hewlett the band has often grappled with the real world 911 featuring d-12 and erry hall was written directly after 9/11 kids with guns from 2005s mon days tackled teenage gang violence but the world now seems as surreal as anything in hewletts comics its most powerful figure an insane clown who would seem more at home in the pages of ank girl than in the white house although albarn deliberately excised specific references to him from s fifth album donald rump hangs over sometimes the attacks are direct as when spits about living the american dream as long as you dont look like me on or when on pleads: tell me wont die at the hands of the police other times the jabs are more satirical its not hard to work out who is pretending to be when preaching about building walls on f the albums themes are overwhelmingly american so are the guests y bring mixed results s hyperactive flow is the perfect foil for s languid vocal on s electro pop fills bobby womacks shoes nicely on and s soulful voice makes s discofied bump slide along on the other hand the talents of and are pretty much wasted either barking nonsense or warbling pointlessly in the background of their tracks sound as confused as s ill-advised hybrid of hip-hop and 4/4 lyrics on might be s darkest but the album has lots of bright music albarn says he thought of it as a party mixtape which translates on via dayglo synths rubbery basslines and catchy hooks apart from which sounds like a cartoon version of zzanine -era massive attack theres little hint of the dub influences of earlier albums albarn also seems more absent his faint wavering voice sounding lost in the echo chambers he sings about on one of the few moments in which he takes the starring role spite its lengthy cast list misses a genuinely surprising guest appearance like mark e smith or lou reed on 2010s plastic beach closest you get is noel gallagher as a backing vocalist on where savages belts out an anti- rump anthem hat albarn seems to have made peace with his old britpop rival is almost as much a message of love and unity as the song itself when those two were trading insults in the 90s their reconciliation would seem as farfetched as the world that now occupies

a year after inaugurating his label with modern passivity returns for a second record the stakes are dialed up on with five full-bore acid and electro jams and a production approach that could be called violent n fact the opening track works almost like a litmus test clearing (or scaring) away listeners with weak constitutions lightens up after the gnarled squall of but not much at its worst the style comes off like a caricature of severe hardware-built techno ( ); in slicker groovier tracks like and the process yields a substantial pay-off but even the records less compelling tracks have a quirk or two that work in their favor theres the modulating drum machine in which barely cuts through the mess of searing acid squelch and distorted synth moans to give it a cogent beat; the way the ruined kick in turns from a 4/4 to a smeared throb and back again is mind-bending but those small pleasures ultimately cant match something as impeccably crafted as s frantic drum pattern or the dystopic sci-fi feel in s robo-speak with tracks that good couldve left the rougher stuff to one side
sleep d the production duo who run butter sessions keep things local y nurture australian talent helping to establish melbourne as an independent scene rather than a stepping stone for local producers on the way to europe ir recent collaborations have also stayed close to home recording two eps this year with albrecht labrooy the duo behind the local label analogue attic four producers share a taste for expansive live sets and dense atmospherics and their styles fuse on this polished release from a scene hitting its prime albrecht labrooy bring a soft-focus ambience to the productions with synths that swell and drifting piano figures from the dj sprinkles playbook on sleep ds signature is heard clearest in the eps sophisticated rhythms ranging from gentle hand percussion to elastic electro on and the surging kick on the only peak club cut whole ep is sequenced like a mini-album with a beatless intro and outro peaking with the wistful melancholy of the title track where murmured voices are only just audible over the patter of the rain
with interest in the chilean overlord of after-hours weirdness at an all-time high following last year s marathon gypsy horns-sampling track fizheuer zieheuer it was perhaps inevitable that a spate of cash-in reissues would follow originally released as part of a various rtists ep in 1998 is ricardo at his most straightforwardly banging a turbulent kinetic slice of super-charged tech-house that doubles back on itself to become progressively harder and tougher for all that it still has villalobos trademark loopiness written all over it a determination to cross all the i s and dot the t s and subvert the dancefloor with his perverse imagination as far as is humanly possible nd it is this latter element that the remixers here have chosen to exaggerate good s rework is stuttery and busy full of ghostly disembodied handclaps driving bass and acres of reverb some cool filter effects liven things up a bit before the track finally settles into a likeable robotic groove about six minutes in franklin de s offering is a dubbier affair; distorted bell effects and phaser stabs play over powerful sub-bass amid a suffocating atmosphere of rubbery pitch-bend chords and small electronic farts overall the track sounds like a drugs party full of lairy annoying aliens this release shows how aiming to sound far-out and inventive just isn t enough; the two remixes have an over-cluttered and inconclusive feel where the original settles for something much simpler with far more impressive results

if there was any doubt no matter how small that s productions were beginning to tread water then this taster for his new album brings the doubters back to reality with a jolt t a time when those who were inspired by hoods timeless 90s catalogue are in danger of sounding too reverent and polite hoods latest single is a refreshing antidote forsaking subtlety for a ruthlessly effective dance floor approach sounds like the aural equivalent of a skillet to the cranium its cheesewire percussion threatening to shred the speakers which it play through once its joined to a repetitive metallic riff hood simply filters the combination until it reaches an inevitable but nonetheless thrilling climax lpha is a less intense experience but it isnt a walk in the park either from the outset pounding relentless drums and firing percussion prevail but a few minutes in hood delivers the coup de grace n eerie synth line gradually appears but then its left to hang in the air adding to the drama just when the suspense starts to become too much to bear hood drops his trademark hissing hi-hats to drive lpha onwards and upwards if his long player attains anything near this standard itll be a serious contender for album of the year
diplos project may be inspired by dancehall but ultimately they make world-traveling pop music informed by edm excess their records are overloaded with collaborators and crammed so full of ideas that they usually end up fidgety and half-baked but their biggest hits pon de floor and original don among them have shown the collective are capable of writing strong pop songs their first release since last years patchy free the universe is their tightest material yet the ep opens with which is so uncharacteristically clean and uncluttered its almost stunning augmented by the shake of you guessed it an aerosol can a motor-mouth verse from rushes things breathlessly ahead like the bus from speed : if it slowed down it might blow up (or at least fall apart) guests on the feel-good reggae jam which has a hyper-percussive breakdown while the mr -featuring apes tnght with apocalyptic hi-hats and angry brass all of them feel taut and controlled even the dancehall-edm of the collaboration feels reined in and guest on which outlines the overstuffed side of : a synth lead scratches up and down the track theres an out-of-nowhere autotuned breakdown and towards the end the increasingly crowded rhythm feels as if its about to burst it may sounds too hectic to hold together but if anything the track is proof that are learning how to manage their shambles
a man goes to berlin and falls in love with techno daniel fishers story would be vanilla if his music were as such but the new yorkers idea of the citys sound is a more playful than usual after launching with a collection of tingly techno last year he returns with the labels first real 12-inch it shows off a neon-streaked take on steely german techno and comes with a shot of berlin cred thanks to berghain resident norman with its creepy vocal sample is the ps dingiest moment the parts already sound as if theyre echoing through a cavernous nightclub ven this one brightens up with an unexpected dusting of piano which also features on the flipside alternating between meditative and cathartic in val the piano is paired with trance snare rolls and jackhammer samples more uplifting builds its own sugar rush letting the piano frantically bounce around filling in the space with shrieking vocals and letting it all fall away into a windswept breakdown that couldve been lifted from a scuba track unlike so many converts to berghain-style techno theres a sense that anything could happen in a track bringing the berlin stoicism norman smooths out into a grayscale tool with an unassuming rhythm and vocals that reverberate like anxious whispers fisher originally commissioned the rework in a fit of excitement after seeing dj at berghain but on he actually manages to outshine his idol
the new sub label of dj deeklines rat records is definitely focusing on more of the rolling breakstep that is coming out probably deeklines answer to the success that dj quests cyberfunk and its off-shoots have seen side a baddest dj rave-step definitely going back a few years is this tune with its rave stylings - deekline and crew were pushing the breaky happy hardcore sound in the mid 90s and baddest dj definitely pays some homage to those days kicking things off with some ambient strings and repeating the much sampled baddest dj on two turntables the breaks kick in along with some bass stabs after the intro the tune loses the beat and creates a build up to one of the simplest yet effective breaks tunes to come out in 02 simple in the fact that it does not have many elements involved - rolling drums and bass are mostly prominent throughout with a few stabs and the strings thrown in here and there effective in the fact that this tune can cause some major damage as youd definitely have ravers going nuts at how old skool this is after a breakdown in the middle the bassline changes to a very familiar rave styled bassline then goes back into the original whoever drops this would be classed as the baddest dj and it wouldnt be a surprise if it was played several times throughout the night methinks this is an old rave tune redone into breakstep styling side b dope style dont be fooled by the wierd intro using some abstract sounds - bleeps and bloops to easily confuse the djs mixing it - dope style incorporates some old skool breakbeat mentality similar to what dj quest and his cyberfunk crew do helped out with some ow vocal samples cut in throughout the track unfortunately it gets a bit weird with the bleeps and bloops thrown in here and there the best part of this tune is the double bass bassline and the rolling breaks which may appeal to some ears baddest dj does it for me on this one and its becoming very hard to find now so if you do see it get it as quickly as possible
have always seen themselves as outsiders the weirdo cousins to oslos holy trinity nd yet with all the leftfield eccentricities their music often fell in the shadow of prins thomas lindstr m and dd terje after all its still space-disco no matter how far out there it goes on s first record since 2012 knut s vik and p l nyhus seem to embrace the sound releasing four tame uncluttered tracks in the nordic disco tradition turns out they can play it straight quite well there couldnt be a better song to set the eps tone than funky and bright dance music as true to the norwegian school as can be it could soundtrack an afternoon train ride through the countryside or give an easygoing house mix some extra propulsion the title track follows suit albeit with a restrained energy and wider instrumental palette; the strings add dramatic flair to an otherwise uncomplicated song is more techno-centric than the rest but the duos buoyant rhythms and starry melodicism win out over the low-end throb reprising those ideas for something more slippery grooves around a meaty disco bassline with its ubiquitous accoutrements hand claps bells synth arps woodblocks etc its both uninspiring and satisfying for its simplicity
marks dominick fernows return to new york after living in l and traveling the world as vatican shadow its also his first major work as since 2013s through window an album that showed fernows interest in techno bleeding into his original alias not so this time: on this double-album fernow looks back over his prolific two decades of work from fierce noise to dark ambient brasive affecting and more melancholy than ever this is the most wide-reaching album yet it seems was meant as a statement addition to its length it comes lavishly packaged through prestigious canadian metal label profound lore fernow also tapped extreme music producer rthur rizk to help dress it all up this professional sheen is clear in the records guitar passages like the gorgeous closer mong which has the nylon lustre of fade black -style metallica those moments feel like a holdover from the original plan for the lp which was to build something made from acoustic instruments and rocks collected around new york s inspiration struck however ballooned into something much bigger brings together all the contradictory impulses we now associate with : beautiful synth lines fizz and bubble beneath squalls of high-pitched noise while fernow howls over top its a tough ten minutes and a warning: if you came looking for vatican shadows techno it might be time to turn around and leave brutal contrast on is the foundation of album veers through some of the harshest noise fernow has put to record in years ( ) and more measured passages pairing epics like the two-part title track with briefer bursts of energy lp hops between ideas and experiments in the tradition of the rock music double-album and even within individual songs things are rarely straightforward res pop potential somewhere in the 80s radio synths of for example but fernows throat-shredding vocals make it sad and despondent though fernows delivery obscures his lyrics many of them are addressed to a you chronicling an intense relationship and underlining s on-going obsession with human connection noise music often seems alienating but is a self-proclaimed album of love songs if in its own violent way on fernow screeches i want to rip out your lower back / and wrap my hands around your neck before finishing with and kiss you on he screams ill meet you there his voice cracking and tearing with each iteration its a desperate appeal for contact that undergirds the writhing pain and fury of this shows how far has come from a project that once seemed like an attempt to make the gnarliest noise possible when he isnt reaching across the void fernow looks deep into himself and his past his writing reaches a new height on the records haunting centrepiece named for the brooklyn neighbourhood he once called home is an extended rumination about suicide over a bed of acoustic guitars and gently rippling synthesizers connecting some of fernows earliest experiences in new york with the wiser self that came back to write fernows deadpan delivery channels sorrow in a controlled way that almost feels more intense than when hes screaming reaches a depth beyond what we usually associate with noise music and like the rest of it stitches together bits and pieces of fernows hundreds-strong discography into one visionary and harrowing piece
fresh from their joyous saturday im in love compendium hamburgs iynamic label here present two new acts two singles and a solomun remix; three accomplished explorations a number current trends germanys mt8 gives us ltweibersommer which blends the bounce sebo k with the skip johnny without wholly capturing the delights either no matter for the robust tones soon collapse into neat melodic hooks taking a surprising yet not unwelcome course towards minimal trance the expectant fizz that flutters around the breaks lifts this from standard melodic house fare po faced solomuns take on all this is to flatten the emotion spreading the remaining elements liberally over a snaking chilean esque rhythm with cowbells castanets and strings brought in for further decoration the energy level steps up for by ukraines rive which lays a prescient tribal sample over a beefy drum track which sizzles like electro house like enfants or more so watamu beach the core is a fragment chorus chopped looped and processed but rather than rely on rote repetition to create meaning the ukrainians are impatient twisting the voices until they swell and crash like waves these are all solid pieces but is outstanding the marriage electronic and sampled elements nimbly avoiding clich and packing a real emotional wallop
fter debuting on hakim murphys machining dreams label murphys partnership with fellow chicago beatsmith gets down to business with a 10 inch for mos deep nd i certainly dont use business lightly: on murphy and the man born velez provide each and every classic drum machine hit you need to get moving and not one more much of the track feels a little boilerplate the upper register 303 melody feels a bit too familiar as does the cloudy half time synth line up top but the way the bassline stutters on its lowest note amidst a cavalcade of 808 claps is likely to set you wiggling regardless goes solo on the flip and while is more novel its a bit less successful velezs production tricks are fancier when hes sitting stag at the controls i cant quite make out the origin of that filtered ultra shifty sheet of noise the whole track is coated in but the mix is a bit of a mess: his dynamic deep house melody cant help but be squashed beneath the brash bombastically arranged drums

theres no question that our age in which we are inundated with sound is unprecedented in history in 1982 satoshi ashikawa included this cautionary note in the liner notes for the original version of the late s music for nine post cards urging listeners to mind the effects of their sonic environments as assiduously as they would architecture interior design food or the air we breathe 35 years later is the antidote to our buzzing phones and a brutal 24 hour news cycle a reminder to slow down and take in the quiet profundity of life yoshimura started work on in an unassuming manner he stared out the window and played the piano attempting to mirror what he saw in short one measure phrases while at work on this project he visited the hara museum contemporary art in the shinagawa ward of tokyo inspired by the clean white minimalism of the museums architecture as well as the trees that rustled in the courtyard he envisaged the nine pieces as environmental music for hara an offer its administrators accepted it was only after visitors frequently asked how to acquire the music playing throughout the grounds that ashikawa and yoshimura launched a record label sound process to release it in so doing yoshimura removed this music from its intended environment but the nine pieces would bring an atmosphere of quiet grace to any setting the static beauty of yoshimuras nine pieces which revolve around simple fender rhodes figures have the ability to bring a sense of comfort into the hustle and bustle of a morning commute or a long flight (as huerco s noted in interviews surrounding his 2016 yoshimura indebted ambient lp for those you who have never (and also those who have) ) but a sense of place remains central to on snow yoshimura quietly intones: snow this is tokyo the music on and its natural follow up pier loft isnt without precedent the interplay between minimalist synths and electric piano echoes that of robert fripp and brian eno on evening star (though a more exact sonic comparison might be the latters 1985 lp thursday afternoon ) the second half of music for nine postcard captures the well balanced melancholy of erik satie and his friend claude debussy yoshimura made the record his first solo album in his early 40s and we feel this weight of experience as well as a lack of the assertive qualities of youth that dissipate with age and wisdom theres an interesting contradiction in the current presentation of this music by a label run by two portland musicians maxwell august croy and visible cloaks spencer doran who revel in the inundation of sounds ashikawa warned against but theres a generosity of spirit that comes through on this reissue (as well as chee shimizus presentation of pier loft ) this isnt a mere collector curio is timeless music with the ability to enrich lives and environments
following on from his summer release on 2020 midnight visions east londoner closes out a buoyant with his second ep on in as many years cross its two tracks sees continue his contemporary broken beat revival merging the genres staggered 4/4 framework with his own ruder dance floor twist on swaps the vocoder on 2011 favourite set the tone for the smooth all-natural vox of the singer who alongside and paul lack makes up the collaborative lack orange juice project openly admits to the purposefully foul treatment of his other half the raw honesty of his lyrics sidling up cosily alongside the organic sounds of the supporting kicks and snares s the vocals retire midway through the track as if suddenly liberated from traditional singer/songwriter convention lets loose with futuristic synth stabs and bass squelches think vikter duplaixs manhood with a more fiery underbelly possibly composed once the relationship had turned sour on the flip t employs similarly springy percussive foundations propping up a combo of breathy choral vocals and a healthy measure of s signature bounce t one point the bassline transforms into an interlude of thick acoustic guitar which though at first feels slightly out of place soon melds with the surrounding elements to form a cohesive dynamic whole
is s debut solo release but the name may already be familiar to some recent faltydl collaboration king brute was a brief but pleasingly gnarled glimpse of what might be in store from the producer this single for r s expands on that promise but only a little as these two tracks demonstrate theres plenty of overlap in sensibility between den and his better-known partner both have a restless mode flitting between grooves and ideas where others might commit to a single loop but where in faltys music that restlessness often feels friendly dens music is all small-hours paranoia s dead-eyed jazz chords and rolling syncopated percussion recall early 00s est london broken beat or perhaps a breakbeat-indebted dubstepper like toasty its aflutter with interesting ideas even if as with king brute before it one wishes they were developed more thoroughly group bench is longer but more frustrating it sounds like dystopian techno caught in purgatory doomed to erratically re-run its opening 32 bars heavy-handed hi-pass filter action doesnt help much either
ripperton and sam s is one of s most interesting labels their secret is simple: theyve gathered a group of great producers from a fertile swiss scene (ripperton himself agn s ) and put their music in the one place as well as unveiling new producers like minz along the way for this release the mysterious whom some will remember from her 2006s epic long distance collaboration with ripperton on num brings more dark perspectiv goodness the vibe is detached and melancholy with a little touch of trance which is to be expected on a label run by ripperton and quality is also to be expected from perspectiv: the sounds are simply deeper and richer than most of the competition with icey melodies poured over cavernous drums is backed by three in house remixes two from agn s and one from the lesser known half of the labels management team sam s rework is not radical stretching out into a more frenetic loop but keeping a lot of the flavour of the original agn s one of the most prolific producers in the minimal scene lately opts for a rough and funky interpretation with his mix which is the rawest and most uptempo cut on this ep yet his mix is even better a tight loop with an array of sounds crammed in from chirping synths to dark dramatic strings its a really swinging re work which provides a great alternative to s more pensive original and completes another excellent perspectiv release
contrary to his worries that clubbers might go home from one of his sets this year at not remembering a single song that they heard sebo s 04 mix is full of the sort of personality driven tunes that seem to be so lacking these days smartly opens up their vinyl division by placing two of them on wax for eternity the first is sebos house edit of s exquisite one of the highlights from the dubsteppers great lengths album from earlier this year sebo flattens out the beat which was formerly a syncopated twitch and gives it the sort of throbbing house energy that his sets are known for plenty of chords play throughout with dubby chords breaking through to further the sense of play ut its the constantly moving bassline that provides the hypnotic sense of movement even if you know in the back of your mind that you arent going anywhere at all s is found early on the disc and its creeping tempo reflects its warm up pace like much of s best work its easy to lose track of how few vocals there actually are despite jonathan illel being the obvious center of attention more than ever though illel is a mere instrument in this downcast epic of small changes and twisting tension you might not remember this one in the morning but in the right hands youll likely remember what the dj brings in right after it
one of s favored tricks is to use the bassline to introduce or anchor a new melodic passage hell keep a track locked into an entrancing monotonic groove buoyed by a one-note bass pattern and suddenly the bass will unspool into a heart-tugging riff it feels a bit like being dragged from the heavens back onto the dusty earth and thats also how i often feel when listening to this three-tracker of gorgeous dreamy emo house: im floating in space far away from my problems then something concrete a melody or vocal digs into my heart and pulls back into the confused messy realm of human desire on the title track a wavering male voice emerges out of bell-ringing bliss to croon im sorry i didnt wait around to say goodbye i guess i didnt want to wait around to see you cry the voice is slightly meandering almost stumbling as if the words are uncertain and hard to get out when this sentiment simultaneously gentle and cowardly gets latched onto a warm disco house beat it turns into raver break-up music perfect for morrissey fans on mdma the other two tunes here form a neat trifecta with each a welcome variant on mixing the melancholic with the psychedelic this kind of aesthetic interplay gives additional urgency to the records more spaced-out sections which become additionally cathartic ecstatically overcoming the gravity of conflicted emotion even if for just one blissed-out weightless instant when filtered pads surge forth and synth notes seem to echo into infinity on are trance tones spiral over a haunting rhodes chord progression and i feel like im barreling into the unknown future in a first-class cabin
after a limited release at the end of 2006 its second time lucky for with this ep already picking up play from the likes of sebo k and efdemin its easy to see why too there are four tracks here and all four are dynamic and pulsing exercises in electronic depth this is techno music done with flair and individualism first up is an instant introduction into moellers huge sound vast dubby chords bounce back and forth and duel with effects that sound like howling winds its a fine beginning to this ep and best of all its just one of the four excellent tracks here next comes a rippling wilderness of dub and detroit keys this is epic: nine minutes of mutating rhythms and melodies that are shaped and crafted with the utmost precision once again the title is so utterly broad that the artist is either setting himself up to fall on his face by failing to match its grandiosity or else is just supremely confident that his track is the embodiment of these words thankfully with its the latter: on the b side continues the dub odyssey with a slightly more locomotive feel and is destined to start dj sets all summer then last of all comes already featured on efdemins ra podcast this is a monster of a different nature here moeller creates one of the techno tracks of the year a juddering bass heavy workout that growls spits and shakes for almost eight minutes to call it the meanest leanest dj tool of the year is to underrate what is a brilliant track in its own right and a scintillating end to this fine ep one great track on a release is rare two is exceptional but here moeller has created four tracks which if you hadnt heard of him till now announce him as a true artist and one to watch for a long time to come

those who knew tom scholefield for his visual art might have been surprised by his debut album had it matched his work for the likes of fellow scot hudson mohawke regional surrealism would have been a maximalist splurge of lurid colours and hd digital shapes instead scholefield retreated into the dank mossy spaces opened up by another scottish act boards of canada four years later the two strands of scholefields output are much closer together title of his second lp mirrors hudmos butter in its indulgent connotations; the music is melodic and glowing with euphoria thats not to say there arent some odd touches opening pair of heat-warped swooner and the gloomy suggest two wildly different directions that scholefield doesnt subsequently follow later is a sickly confection surrounded by more decorous tracks but where regional surrealism thrived on these sorts of twists and turns and was a stronger album for it most of sticks to a kind of formula its precedent might be oneohtrix point never (another collaborator of scholefields): smeared synth numbers like and suggest rifts with a dash of idm whimsy scholefields innovation is to chuck ideas from his raving past into the pot: 90s hardcore the sugar rush of happy hardcore or trance its a potent mix but not a particularly refined one melodies sometimes feel clunky and the textures a bit flat on the wistful lead line isnt enough to alleviate the plodding pace things pick up when scholefield makes bolder gestures orens with its janky piano-and-diva loop is s sweetest moment and its most rave-referential its wave of euphoria breaks onto an enormous detuned bassline and filtered crowd noise tumbles across the stereo field its a moment of outsized flair thats miles away from scholefields earlier productions and perhaps halfway towards something better
something a bit different for the back to mine series when you go round to the house there s not much in the way of raw dance music but plenty in terms of entertainment and the novelty value of some of the songs songs like nina simone s cover of my sweet lord which omits all the krishna references or the relatively unknown soul from songs:ohio you d be hard pushed to find a more passionate heartfelt vocal around the dub style gets a look in the peerless lee scratch perry and the upsetters opening up with cloak dagger the early days of rave get a reference at the other end of the cd with mmm s donna a bleeping electro monster in between the styles of music vary wildly psychedelia is an expected inclusion thanks to sam gupal and piero piccioni the former starts out in subdued manner but throws off the shackles emphatically while the latter has some weird and wonderful organ sounds the nitty gritty dirt band give a full-on hoedown with the riotous nashville blues one to charge round the room too and at the other end of the emotional scale come joy division and the magisterial decades proof if ever it was needed that synthesizers can evoke feelings too a good selection then and an insight into the components making up the style it certainly opened my eyes to some new music always a good thing
for the trance heads consistantly deliver the goods with recent releases from lustral and accadia look to continue the quality trend with their latest on the a-side to disc one is midway s remix from the outset midway keep the tempo upbeat with a twisted stabbing synth the subtle vocals filter the air as the melodic elements then take control a breakdown features midway into the track and with it comes a melodic line of big room proportions a late night mix this by midway with a big buzz around this rework already on the flip is s original mix not as upbeat as the midway remix but packs a punch nevertheless following a similar pattern with its 4/4 beats followed by a layer of 2 melodies one a subtle base like melody overridden by the more obvious guitar like melody a solid production as shown by midway who seemed to keep the same formula with their remix on the flip why change a good formula as this original mix seems to have on disc two steve murano steps up to the plate on remix duties for side-a not as upbeat as the mixes on disc one and with a more electro edge overall nice beats and the aforementioned electro synths open the mix as a breakdown soon dawns equipped with some lovely strings and the guitar like melody of the original the track then takes a turn for the twisted as acid like bleeps take control a very interesting mix with a hint of originality greg murray s mix is on the flip it s another 4/4 incarnation with neat drums and a smooth paced trance feel to it use of arpeggiated melodies through the beats and a use of sweeping synths and the original melody in the breakdown make this a record that doesn t seem to capture the originality and freshness as its brother on the flip interesting nonetheless overall this is a solid release from one must feel that some secret ingredient to a truly great record is missing it has quite a catchy melody and as such may appeal more than it has appealed to me worth a look

not to suggest that are in any way taken yello but its hard to listen to the new york duos second single (and first for df ) and not think of that swiss duos single you gotta say yes to nother excess dont get me wrong it doesnt sound anything like the song but as a motto for music-making justin vandervolgen and douglas lee always say yes to any and all sounds to the point of glorious excess the appropriately named dogpiles squelches robo-snares squirts of acid lasers hi-hats crisper than a chip cheap rave fx run through a wood chipper androids dreaming electric whippoorwills deep whumps a screaming synth solo and a freshly-opened can of handclaps did i leave out the bubble machine didnt nd thats all before they hotwire a zz top guitar (circa legs ) and take a joyride deeper into the whole mess that it never sounds out of hand is a testament to s ability to strike a balance something their remixes havent always exhibited ok is the same basic track but one that subtracts rather than adds it reveals higher frequencies and a bit more space between the meaty house kick and the 303 when that guitar returns the second time around its not a spray of sparks but rather a lone flare out on the horizon
releases are few and far between but a tune like the lead here is so perfect its the sort of thing you play over and over again without ever growing tired of it only the labels fourth outing in two years its even more impressive given that is a debut production foray for the swedish duo behind it quite why it works so well is hard to fathom maybe its the bouncy trumpets maybe its the ruff and raw house beats maybe its the myriad other little colourful bits which squirrel their way throughout the arrangement from start to finish or maybe its all of these things on any other ep the two remaining tracks would be standout in their own right: is a well-rounded bubbling house track rich in distant synth patterns bobbling beats and lazy long lingering piano chords latch on to the rubbery and arpeggiated bassline and feel yourself carried away to a better place or else allow the more mournful swagger of adam again complete with genuinely musical piano smears and its muted disco dazzle to slowly twist you in many different directions at once dense but dynamic colourful and creative this is orchestral ornate house music that goes straight for your heart

losing max_m in may was both sudden and tragic he was well loved and admired for his personality as much as his music and then theres m_rec ltd the label he spent years growing and was one our favorites milanese artist was one maxs prot g s they worked closely together as overall severity debuting at the end 2014 on a split 10-inch with fabrizio lapiana has since emerged from under maxs wing though a sense his guiding presence has never been far away of feels like a full break from the nest and it would have made max proud the ep has all the stripped-down and functional cool unsuitable therapy s only other solo record to date except its delivered with a bit more flair here there was a deviant spirit poking through schapoid on the split toe tag ep for parachute and here it is again on in this case however its a billowing synth line that creeps in around two and a half minutes eventually it backs down but not until it significantly subverts the mood its a neat switch compared to say the steady forward swell the records emotive clout is saved for the close and of is in every way as melancholy as the title implies but for those looking for a dance floor track with bite is the standout its so groovy that it hooks you immediately then a lovely melodic squiggle kicks in to finish the job after one listen youll feel like youve known it a lifetime
s nonplus two-tracker his first record of is a relaxed affair sebastian kramer nails the trick of being restrained and subtle on the surface while a huge streak of colour bubbles beneath res a lot of warmth here too with both tracks featuring generous keys and pillowy expanses of bass leavens skittering claps hats and synth inflections with undulating low-end and gentle rebounding drums ts sleazy ambience is bolstered by the stringent calm of titular vocal phrases on the flip has an almost experimental feel that positions it well away from kramers peak-hour material quasi-tropical percussion flits against giant acidic keys that sound something like an old blackstrobe 45 played at 33 rpm s two productions exude confidence with an unhurried ease
presslab records is a name thats become synonymous with releasing many flavors of house over the years so its fitting that their new offshoot label focuses on the electro side of things presslab kick into action with a first release from fellow italians christiano vinici massimo licari gets two takes of which the superjuno remix is first vincis pseudonym kicking off with a live sounding groove of snares and tight beats an electro edge synthline creeps in and together with various sounds stuttering delaying and reshaping the flow is kept at a constant its continuous synthlines alternating control the track right through and leave us in no doubt as to its ability to get us moving the sasha carassi remix takes it deeper with a peakier dose of rumbling bassline and stabbing synthline that gradually filters up mirrored by another as the beat drops out repeating in places and kicking off on its way again alternating between the angry groove and acidic elements two quality electro numbers the carassi remix being the favourite
despite only beginning his production in career in 2006 has notched quite an imporessive list of credits next to his name get physical sci + tec and resopal have all welcomed the parisian to their ranks over the past few years his latest sees yet another debut this time for whose ever-increasing roster includes minilogue and seth troxler these days as well drips with the same darkly atmospheric touches that are so prevalent in troxlers work; off-key metallic clanging demonic percussion and a variety of half-whispered croaking vocals colour the piece throughout its more predictably structured (not necessarily a bad thing) and lies halfway between a arem-eqsue minimal excursion and a full-on techno explosion the track builds and subsequently breaks without much fuss; neither retiring introvert nor chest-beating extrovert its a good mid-setter that leaves a dance floor in no doubt that a change in gears has been undertaken without completely revealing which road youll be heading on on the flip konrad lacks remix is where the action moves out of the well-produced but linear category being undeniably situated right at the front of the sit up and pay attention class its about as happy-go-lucky as an asthmatic cat on ritalin with a gloomily twisted atmosphere driven home from the off with a writhing chaotic melody straight from the silent hill school of putting your teeth on edge the beats are clean the bassline wobbles nicely and theres some percussion about halfway though that makes you wonder if a jazz drummer hasnt mistakenly stumbled into the proceedings but its those deep dark keys that will get those necks properly exercised
before the fuss has calmed down over h rs current release from kosmas epsilon this exciting label is back on the case with a remix package of mortar pestles itsachickthing and dst first off the blocks is a luke chable re-take of itsachickthing not needing any lengthy introductions chable gets stuck in from the start with his now trademark broken beats and glitchy percussive patterns that give his track a swing of their own gradually the bassline creeps in amidst contorting sounds that lurk in the backround and starts to move into another phase as the bassline changes and a piano melody takes over soothing our senses and taking it up a notch as another gently intertwines together the break pushes it in a deeper direction with heavy cutting up of the beats while a timid string melody floats in tandam before stepping back up a gear again with the addition of rezd bassline and meatier drum programming that all seems to dissipate into nothingness at its end the second remix sees kristo beyrouthy aka kaybee take a look at dst project who turns out a mix thats not quite genre fitting more a collection of many elements and familiar sounds that meld together to make a darkend techy groove nice idea but gets a bit overshadowed by chables massive take
colin de la plantes alias may be tongue in cheek hes always underground baby but its difficult to argue that over the past decade s played by anything but his own rules this two-track vinyl outing for arbara preisingers explores the twisted mutant disco thats been a rich seam running through most of the canadians work the trippy disco of plaits machinegun cowbells thumping glam rock snares portentous synths and somewhere in the distance an unsettling vocal snippet not quite as satanic and warped and with a tempo that slips under 120 pm sidles by in a clash of echoing rimshots and rattling congas supported by a sullen bassline two-thirds through for seemingly no other reason than because he could de la plante drops in a brief interlude that sounds like an excerpt from the laderunner soundtrack then as quickly as it appears its gone and were back into a locked groove that threatens to never run out
has recently found himself emerging from the shroud of anonymity as a key figure in horizontal ground a perhaps unexpected move that has seen him go so far as to found a new and pseudo-eponymous label in syndrome z his latest release is an appearance on burgeoning ristol house label and though the days of 19 26 1 18 5 are gone his techno remains as smooth and as swung as ever in keeping with increasingly moody and hushed output the two tracks here are restrained and almost comatose in their ghostly pallor is full-on whisper techno every element donning the same shade of grey for a beat that sounds like its made out of tape hiss the kicks and snares sound like fingers gently knocking on dusty wood and the bass becomes softly muffled for a sensation thats oddly comforting even as the beat contorts in s usual jarring angles ringing things back up to a more recognizable volume is still pretty skeletal but has a stronger kick and a harder groove more compatible with bangers like snake cave not content with just a solid framework sneaks in an occluded muffled (again) sample that gets knotted and tangled in with the lopsided beat adding a shade of the avant to an otherwise purely functional structure
when dubstep went global its most successful artists met a variety of fates some migrated to house and techno while some stuck with an increasingly limited formula some like skream ascended to bigger things others aimed just as high and undershot spectacularly way back in 008 the swaggering synths of s gully brook lane were an early indicator of the genres stadium potential but the tension in early productions between the austerity of dubstep and his taste for gleeful overload didnt hold for long shortly after magnetic man showed how to make a dubstep album with pop appeal s 0 lp the vision got it quite badly wrong it was grotesque and overcooked in places but mostly it was just plain dull its followup certainly isnt that this perhaps is s vision finally realised its just as overblown as its predecessor more so even thanks to a palette of expensive sounding orchestral plug-ins but the vocal appearances are much more sparing limited to unremarkable turns from zak abel and rochelle and a skeevy performance from sam frank on the albums one truly grim moment instead the focus has shifted back onto s instrumentals the producer has described as a story that should be enjoyed from start to finish like a film and for once that tired cliche is pretty accurate the album is cinematic in sweep theres an absurdly grandiose and an whose luxurious wafts of guitar carry a hint of jazz-fusion there are three consecutive s guiding us through a succession of cartoon landscapes from the steely menace of qo nos (a star trek reference) to the sci-fi pomp of neon city and the sentimental spirit ruins the moody segues slotted between tracks are often as entertaining as the tracks themselves but all of this is really just embellishment if is a film then its a michael bay blockbuster: slick and engaging but totally adolescent in worldview its plot tortuous its characters flimsily drawn all of it an excuse for a string of eye-popping action set-pieces when they come they offer a pretty undeniable thrill s bassline crumples like a metal-on-metal impact rendered in hi-def cgi while is part boogie update part euphoric trance breakdown and part godzilla-sized dubstep banger a track like with its cheesy synthetic piano and searing synths is bracingly naff but compelling nonetheless still just as an hour or so into transformers the adrenaline rush peters out and the clunky sentimentality starts to grate so too does this album outstay its welcome the title of mawkish closer sums it up nicely feels like the album that has wanted to make all along whether that s a good thing is questionable
is cool he has one of those arty-sounding german names and you imagine him living in a pristine/bohemian berlin apartment and spending his life getting wasted in a vaguely cerebral way at afterhours parties musically he has a strong if schizophrenic pedigree back in the day he produced and remixed many of the biggest names in electroclash (peaches chicks on speed miss kittin to name a few) but these days his dj mixes and more recent remixes have veered towards a brainy minimalism that has attracted a fervent internet following and led to the bandying about of words like seminal follows the stylistic template of last year s pass your bedtime mix there are all of the sonic tics and tells of modern german techno but one hesitates to fully call it minimal because of the chunkiness and immediacy of the tracks the mix is built on a framework of solid heavy chunky drums the kind you can hear in your gut from a block away when approaching a club spiced with a pick n mix of different strategies to engage the listener in that underlying physical pulse they range from the melancholy soul-tinted vocals of cassy s night to remember to the pelvic grind of samim and michel s exercise and from thence to the familiar trippy sounds of anja schneider and sebo k s rancho relaxo this tacking back and forth between different styles doesn t come across as bitty but neither does it quite seem coherent there is definitely a great selection of tracks here with highlights such as the acidic fervour of tobias street knowledge the dubby tribalism of femi kuti mixed into luciano melchior s father as well as the peak of the set the pairing of dj yellow s much overlooked goddess with dinky s home on a sunday ultimately this mix is a great sampler of some of this year s most distinctive musical moments (within the realms of minimal house and techno) but it s a difficult mix to fall in love with as it lacks a coherent thrust or direction i don t get absorbed in its flow rather i wait for the next track i like to appear never quite reaching that i want to be in a club now feeling that the best mixes can conjure
this is not the house that you have come to know this is a different rhythm this is a new style but dont let the name funky house fool you to th k g that youre go g to be hear g dj gregory or seamus haji this is an entirely different beast younger hungrier and freed almost entirely from the chicago tradition is one of the lead g producers this new london scene that looks to brazilian caribbean and african sounds for spiration (with a hefty slice of uk grime and dubstep the mix too) its raw energetic and to my ears the most excit g th g happen g dance music right now is funky like a panther stalk g through the twilight its what happens when you take party music and pass it through a filter of urban gloom powered by a hiccup g rhythm that stomps for two beats and wiggles for two more the groove to is like dubstep with a sex drive or broken beat with a desert eagle its jeans roska decorates this basic chassis with brazilian whistles and ravey stabs but these carnival trapp gs cant conceal the menace at the core of the tune its the strongest th g on this ep and one of the most strik g tracks on the scene right now fellow dance music critic tim f ney has described it as the dest y of funky house has a similar rhythm but is complemented by a str g riff that gives it a happier more upbeat feel like 8bar grime it goes cycles periodically lift g the energy up a notch and then tak g it down aga unlike though this feels like an example of the genre rather than a highlight f ally is the closest to traditional us house with a bongo-driven 4/4 beat and if you believe love vocal snippets the groove doesnt stand still oscillat g restlessly around a perky flute riff aga this is a solid piece of production and i can imag e it gett g a lot of play london but if youre new to the genre this isnt the track thats go g to conv ce you of its merits for that you know exactly where to go
with its three eps so far guy gerbers rumours label looks like its shaping up to be innervisions-lite offering the same sumptuous sounds but none of the anthemic qualities (at least not yet) the labels third release from german up-and-comer is probably its best but everything about it feels a little lacking with cinematic reverb and a teasing melody could have been a perfect ibiza smash but its hesitant in all the places it should let loose its opening-set fodder: the lead sounds like a gently strummed harp and never grows beyond a murmur the flipside shows better arrangement skills using a delicate piano loop as a base to build and build and build we end up at an ornate array of strings smoothed-out synthesizers and other little touches that flow smooth as silk which is a nice enough place to be might have the production values down pat but he needs to work on making his songs memorable and really you could say the same for rumours at this point

is a new name that first surfaced with cut the weight (pts 1 2) a slab of strung-out experimental techno released on 2013 compilation halha behind the alias though are two chicago artists who might already be familiar to tuned-in heads: karl meier a longtime dj and all-around scene stalwart whos worked at gramaphone and other key record shops and jon krohn a member of the experimental rock outfit male who produces abstract industrialized rhythms as stave after that spot on halha and an ep featuring an extended version from regis earlier this year the duo now returns to with the dynamic mini-lp has eight tracks four on each side totaling just over 30 minutes the subtle immersive first half eases into action with the title track a mellow syncopated cut layered with hissing atmospherics and low guitar stirrings briefly hints at the confrontation that comes later its brooding percussion sounds almost like ancient methods and theres a distorted lead that wheels around in a deranged fashion is a return to clear air with lo-fi choral drones and percussion achieving a hazily hypnotic effect soars even higher through endless expanses of warm blissful noise the mood instantly turns darker and more fraught on the flip beginning with this one is as close as gets to conventional 4/4 techno but growling mid-range intensifying drones and harsh squalls of feedback give it a fluidity and emotional impact that place it far above much of todays stoic fare what follows is perhaps the records most visceral cut: produced by favorite samuel kerridge using source material from the pairing is perfect with kerridges indecipherable sermon-like ranting delivered amid a storm of sparse booming drums and deep-fried distortion a blur of broken beats then brings about s finish is a minute-long bout of cacophonous peak-time techno and laced with ethereal ambiance surges triumphantly to a sudden end i wish a few of these tracks were longer but thats a minor gripe s wide-ranging yet focused approach makes for an excellent record one worth listening to from front to back
just when is a remix package an album never it seems if a rea negrots is anything to go by but fork out for all seven mixes here and youre paying album prices anyway does it matter not in our digital world although the vinyl version only features the first three remixes here it kicks off with the one that will garner the lions share of interest ricardo elephantine remix of the venezuelan singers takes the briefest snatch of vocal and pulls it in and out of the mix across nearly 14 minutes of cantering stripped-out left-leaning 125 bpm tech house adds successive layers of instrumentation it starts with a metronomic ping to which is added subtle avant-garde synth reports then slapped percussion elements hints of a melody whistling snares on and on it goes until a minute or so shy of the halfway mark were all present and correct for the tracks remainder yes its gargantuan and impressive in its girth but and ill be probably accused of philistinism here you could trim three or four minutes off and still be left with something as imposing of the remaining remixes across the piece the star turn is by berlin-based swedish/spanish duo dance they strap the original of to a disco rocket and fire it back to the mid-70s with a throbbing moroder-ish rhythm track as propulsion its peppered with tropicalia percussion and distant dubby echoes; its an irresistible eight minute techno-disco groove philip gives the title track a bouncy house makeover while kiki provides two hypno-house takes may hog the limelight but dance win the day

katsunori sawa and yuji kondo keep things exceedingly dark on their first full release as since 2011 the four-track ep for s eponymous label doesnt stray far from the solo records these two japanese artists have made in recent years which is fine few in techno can match their refined intensity theres a heavy elemental vibe to these four tracks thanks largely to the duos muscular broken beats but what makes sawa and kondo unique is the way they suffuse their music with layers of nerve-wracking ambient textures as sharp as they are subtle its a specialists sound one thats likely to wear down less adventurous listeners kicks off the commotion with hollow drones and a wailing indecipherable voice faster and leaner seems to sneak away after a couple minutes only to return with its industrial machinery grinding more intensely s b-side adds strangled feedback-drenched guitars to the mix a discordant whole-note progression adds a semblance of melody however unhinged it may be to the stormy peaks of while is a full-on noise assault that briefly abates for some cut-up spoken word the track ends a particularly exhausting techno record in face-melting fashion

f youve ever been in the los angeles area on a monday or thursday night during the past decade you might have caught mosphere described as las longest running party for 80s inspired funk boogie electro and modern funk the weekly party was founded by socal native d m an artist whose dedication to the music is only rivaled by his encyclopedic knowledge damon riddick whos now in his mid 40s has slowly carved out a notable career as a dj and musician growing from a prolific solo artist with recordings that date back to the late 80s to a collaborator with icons like snoop dogg and steve arrington of slave ut regardless of his rise in popularity riddick has never ditched or dissolved mosphere when hes in town and available you can see him at virgil spinning his vast record collection and hopping on the mic to sing give a shout out or share some uplifting words any fan of funk would be hard pressed to find a better night out as far as contemporary djs go riddick has an old school style and an uncompromising ethos in the booth so when the d m dj kicks begins with the man saying whats happenin its less a question than an invitation to experience the charming idiosyncrasies that are part and parcel to what he does lo fi recordings classic effects bleeding heart earnestness casual mixes and sub 120 tempos are all defining qualities of this mix and it shouldnt be any other way with 19 tracks spread over 81 minutes the set is patient and considered as selections often play in near entirety s testament to just how much riddick respects these obscure classics a simplistic bubbly groover like each oy would make a good transition tune for some djs but here its given the full six minutes to shimmy and clap save for the occasional filter sweep delay or 808 kick used as an accent each track here is played in its original form without edits riddick is a purist upholding this musics history as sacrosanct and for his kindred spirits that reverence will be a boon for the mix others however could find the lack of momentum and slow mixing hard to stay engaged with things dont really get moving until track seven when s a late disco favorite sets up lusty 80s electro jam s late 90s house gem then jumps into a jazzy swing at 126 pm the mixs peak tempo re are plenty more highlights afterwards s a heavy funk tune that riddick adlibs over and understated d m exclusive eliever to name a couple but nothing follows up on the midsections energy only unexpected inclusion is roken a beatless drowsy synth piece from s excellent debut album aside from the song being gorgeous in and of itself the way riddick uses it to move from hard smacking funk to a more sentimental zone is remarkable roken slips effortlessly into the stepping melodic groove of by ny an early 80s musician who was recently reissued by washington dc label pp transition is followed by contemporary artists like and nite jewel d m collaboration as well as s 84 boogie belter reak and the minute long closer from the sole album 82s first flight all ends with the dj himself calmly encouraging the listener that final third of dj kicks might not be its strongest section but it no less feels like the most emblematic of riddicks timeless appeal connecting funks past present and future with an unbreakable thread of authenticity and positivity
s is a four-track ep a web portal a short film an app and a precursor to her european tour with animal collective n the middle of all this sits a love story an extreme imagining of 21st century digi-lust with an unhappy ending t fleshes out the character a manifestation of consumerist culture at its most vacuous with a dollop of tim heidecker and eric wareheims absurdist humour squeezed on top but will anyone outside of devotees be interested in this stuff until now has musically speaking represented a side of the label that d guess many people can get on board with dont wanna / lets do t lover and usa captured the best aspects of s demented style but on we get just get a bit of this inventiveness as the focus is ceded to the projects wider aims a sort of looser ballad is in the vein of s covers of c line dion and toni braxton t establishes the eps bunny-boiler tone: f had a chance to make a tiny wish / would be for all the other girls to die / and let me get by on my fucking own is also a slow one notable for its dry drum and vocal treatments and the chorus: finally m not a slag now that have got my on and we get some of the old madness parts of are the eps most abstract but they best express the theme of blind jealousy: as maniacal synth blasts are chained to the kick drum and clipped vocals youre amazing you can sympathise with what shes going through is stylistically scattershot toggling through scuzzy hip-hop pop punk noise and harp passages and culminating with an angry swarm of vocals and synths stabs ts all harmless fun but even when these tracks explore the distinctive compositional ideas that have defined until now they dont stick long in the memory
it might be hard to initially divine but how to dress wells favorite records of include planet mus juke offerings two night slugs singles and everything deadboy put his hand to not so hard to understand salem the pitch-dark metal of burzum and - tom krell the distorted r b falsetto behind the project fits neatly into whatever is happening in and around witch house and hypnagogic pop a brainy deconstructionist of a number of genres into something altogether transfixing krell is a philosophy student so its easy to bring to bear plenty of thoughts on the hows and whys but what makes so interesting is how immediate it sounds songs here are deliberately lo-fi filled with bits of feedback and vocals that seem to crackle if they dare to reach above a whisper but unlike many of his peers on say olde english spelling bee krells tracks dont feel formal exercises se are pop songs just listen to the fuzzy but ever-present thump of the live track hes a crowd-pleaser at heart res a different aim here than with james ferraro and autre ne veut whose music can feel absolutely exhausting after awhile at a little bit less than 40 minutes these songs almost reach that point krells insistence on falsetto above all else may be too much same goes for the sound quality but like a techno producer that swears by his analogue gear or a folk musician that wont plug their guitar in krells aesthetic decisions will be catnip to others but i cant help but think theres something in here for listeners with as wide-ranging tastes as krell himself has the delicacy of a max richter record wont im is pains being pure at heart dunked in water when krell gets into the studio he outfits his tracks with sonic peculiarities that keep you on the edge of the seat its a terrific balancing act one which best coast and zola jesus gave up on when they made a move toward poppier pastures in but as evidenced by the results of its one well worth trying to pull off
ive seen dj a few times over the years and while the music he plays varies the way he plays it stays pretty much the same the opposite of a flashy mixer julian raymond smith lets each track soak fully into the pores of the dance floor before he unfussily brings in something else the success of such a patient approach depends on a particular type of track: one that can command a crowd over extended periods whether through sheer force or a heightened sense of drama smiths long-germinating debut album a bodyshock of post-punk techno called consists solely of these sorts of tracks in other respects its a new look for the bristol producer; hes better known for flying the house flag when everybody else in the city was still making dubstep his style has changed but the qualities smith strives for in his music are more present than ever: extreme dance floor pressure a bold sense of style and the odd madcap flourish nobody else could get away with smith works with a limited toolbox most of it brought out on opener theres the yammering bassline the biscuit-tin kick drum the sweet synth pads offering wafts of catharsis as with much of his music the ingredients are retro but the way theyre combined can be dazzling and are bruising steampunk constructions of squalling delay and whipcrack percussion on the brilliant synchronised bluez ten-tonne drums offset a serene high-octave melody forsakes drums altogether sounding like a spooky john carpenter score smiths hulking productions are camp enough not to seem pompous and stern enough not to descend into silliness the best moments are when he sails closest to the wind as with the drunken synth-horn melodies on (they bring to mind the cheeky sax line on 2012s singularity jump another smith triumph ) but he can play it straight too and does so to excellent effect on where a tense sub pulse is bathed with gorgeous aquamarine chords aims for extremes of emotion and it hits the bullseye every time
follows on from his simian mobile disco remix with further explorations of deepest 4/4 on this 12 for his own label while the smd remix held little of s signature sound this track is awash with it put simply commands a percussive intensity and level of detail that not even ricardo villalobos can match while the steady kick drum goes and the sub pulses the percussion runs dances drops fades out fades back in echoes and generally amazes top this mastery sits samples and synths that make for s most desolate piece since blood on my hands torsten pr frock the ex-chain reaction producer who has recently been creating quite a stir as t++ contributes the remix here he drops most of the percussion out of the mix for a version thats far more dubbed and washed out yet this is no ambient take the drums skitter all across the surface and the booming sub is still very much present here proves that is he very much comfortable working outside of the dubstep template in which he made his name truly essential 12-inch for anyone interested in electronic music and its cutting edge
disruption in electronic music has taken many forms the term appeared this month in michelle lhooqs feature about the implications of the cdj she suggested that cdjs which allow you to instantly skip anywhere in a tracks timeline have led to a dj method thats built more on stuttering than seamless continuity theres been a parallel trend in the music itself driven by artists whose tracks start and stops abruptly and squeeze exciting music out of this method on their new split ep which unifies jaw dropping sound design with impossible rhythms and a generous amount of bass pressure disruption is nothing new for electronic music just look at 90s idm or breakcore (dj /rupture even named himself after this aesthetic) but this new wave of producers is distinguished by a taste for high fidelity textures an approach that treats sound like sculpture s track feels especially cinematic with drastic shifts in tone that suggest a kind of freeform narrative the remix evens out the irregularities preserving the cybernetic sound palette while imposing a militant order on the drums by has the most dance floor potential with a barrage of overdriven kick drums and a wall of screaming textures puts the track into an algorithmic blender on his remix and what emerges is a mind bending lattice of difficult rhythms the most remarkable thing about this release is the ease with which these young producers navigate two disparate skill sets: impressive three dimensional sound design and a genuine sense of musicality
who can say what s new sub-label limited might be for with about half of its 12-inches devoted to marshalls work and the rest to a small group of artists itself isnt all that inclusive and judging by this first record nkltd looks like its offering similar fare to its parent label with the same red dot cover motif to boot ut thats ok because musically marshall has never been prone to repeat himself living up to its title is shrouded with percussive echoes and other white noise in this respect it has a fairly dub-like approach but the complete absence of bass results in a slightly unusual sheen the first three minutes or so are filled out with toms hand drums and parched claps while the second half introduces wavy guitar-like chords that sound off lazily blending quickly into the mire given this source material kevin s remix is surprisingly dark resting on a marcel dettmann-like thump placing marshalls original chords into a centrifuge he spins them with reckless force transforming the lazy tones into a frenetic catchy hook has the same kind of fuzziness of but this time the dub influence is felt as 2-step rather than 4/4 spread atop dry pattering snares its lashings of treacley organ are hard to resist even if they are rather wistful all in all a strong start for limited

returns to the en-soul stable with the featuring 4 new productions the new jersey based producer looks set to deliver more chunky house music my is first up and the result is just that solid chunky house music some deep and chunky tribal drum patterns are pretty much the flavour here as the track flows in a pretty similar fashion throughout summer beats is a little more like it as smooth warm pads surround a nice chunky kick drum and deep baseline probably one of mike s strongest production to date it s the funk again continues the fine form from summer beats and delivers another chunky house cut driven by a deep baseline that s rides quite well with the nice percussive elements 96 degrees concludes the ep with probably the funkiest track of the lot smooth vocal snippets are looped creating a good vibe alongside some smooth drums and subtle deep baselines this is more like it from mike i must confess i have been a bit disappointed with his release on en soul to date but this ep finally shows the class and diversity he is capable of

some of the best parts of s hollowed were reflective alan myson has proven to be deft with beats and bass which is what made that albums abstract structures so striking but theres been an introverted aspect to his music as far back as 2008s cyclical and that kind of mystical ambience continues to appear on mysons latest leads with the title track which was one of hollowed s most characteristic moments its dynamic with a blend of palpable instrumentation amidst the electronic programming but its best quality is the way it combines delicate sounds with swarms of much bolder ones other tracks are previously unreleased is a cousin of hollowed s redeemer and transports us back to that solitary altar only now the place is deserted and play with dynamics in the same way as jenova the former scuttles and creeps on spidery legs while the latters clubby throb sweeps in from the shadows expands like a balloon and soars on warm jets of air myson is at his most probing and thoughtful lately and its a joy to hear

frican rhythms was an early highlight for l i e s it neatly summarized the labels exotic appeal submerging a perpetual groove in a whirlpool of hand percussion and psychedelic vocal samples just house enough to work in a set and just bizarre enough to stand out fter two recent collaborative outings with steve summers as confused nik dawson finally returns for a solo ep on the label that made his name has the same hypnotic and circular feel of frican rhythms this one has cleaner lines than its predecessor however and the spacey synth at the centre winds a delirious path over and over providing a gooey counterpart to the rigid rhythm beneath the flipside is more mechanical distorted percussion in rigid lockstep is at the heart of but a softer synth roaming in the background provides some padding; its the textural inverse of the -side is more pedestrian theres nothing wrong with its wispy melody or the failing-subwoofer kick drums but your mind will probably be wandering back to by the time it kicks into gear
craig richards has been banging it out weekly at fabric since it opened and he s also had several mixes on the fabric label showcasing his interest in dark electro-tinged minimal techno for this double header hes teamed up with transparent sound the uk duo of orson bramley and martin brown whose recent productions have veered increasingly close to richards favoured sound or as richards puts it deeper groovier and more 4/4 based as opposed to the electro they used to do richards has also expressed an interest in collaborating with live electronics and musicians on stage and the albums launch party was held at fabric on july 1st hence this double cd release with richards mixing the first disc (including digital effects and processing) and transparent sound offering a live studio set on disc 2 live richards sets can be most disorienting putting fabrics main room through a spin dryer and often eclipsing his high-profile international guests here without dancers to interact with things are considerably flatter yet they are consistent andy toths jovian zoology opens things perfectly all enticing blips bass and crumpled tin yet the next several tracks vary little from this template: the appearance of crane ak from the old force tracks roster makes you realize how long this sort of sound has been going ryan crosson sweet n candy and falko brocksieper all appear early on and segue effortlessly - too effortlessly - each track bleeding into its neighbour with little sense of transition or development lexdinamos iky brings in a dread-filled vocal worthy of anthony rother t raumschmieres knisterpop adds a pinch of nastiness with his trademark buzzsaws and dying speaker failure while unds cocopuffs scatters fairy dust and dazzles but through to the finish its all sleek forward drive with few bumps in the road richards use of effects seems ironically intended to reduce rather than embolden with dry rhythmic passages extended streamlining the whole rather than beefing up parts richards has said that he aimed for a hypnotic mix and while minimal purists may find the relentlessness entrancing it will be considered monotonous by more catholic listeners while richards final few tracks particularly marc ashkens hair up high hinted at grander vistas to come but these arent delivered by transparent sound fortunately their set is different all large plastic chunks in obvious arrangements rather than petite tics and subtlety but like many recorded live sets their formula soon grows tired secrets of the sane wastes no time emerging all guns blazing with old-school chords a synthetic flute melody and acid pulses but their set is even more homogeneous than richards proper techno incorporates water droplets and clicks and spot the difference returns the drums to traditional electro rhythms but otherwise the same twisting pads sweeping chords and electro fizz never let up live this music could be most satisfying but on disc its too blunt richards seems to have taken the other route removing much of what makes his live sets exciting
eleven years after the release roni size has set himself the unenviable task reissuing one the most well known (and owned) drum n bass albums all time iconic status the masterpiece he created with deebee supergroup reprazent makes it at once untouchable ubiquitous and if it is to be re-released in need an update of course the original was perfect pioneering a unique sound that was both futuristic and nostalgic and introducing the underground to the mainstream for the first time however a well-deserved rcury music prize put on c fee tables the world over so while its production hasn t dated familiarity places it firmly in the electronic epicentre cool britannia bristol circa 1997 so what does mr size do to breathe new life into an album that everyones already got thereby making it an essential second purchase well it seems everything all by himself remasters and re-edits rare and live tracks the only reissue trick that he doesn t pull is guest remixes no doubt cynics will claim that the timing this deluxe edition proves that it s an afterthought full cycle cashing in on the ten year anniversary they missed in 20 but it s more likely a reflection the time spent by one man working over his legacy and unfortunately overworking it for some reason size was determined to introduce added value to without increasing its running time rather than sticking new and rare material on a second disc he s made room for it on one by compressing the original album into half its size superfluous supporting tracks are nothing new but that this edition doesn t feature the classic record in full is reissue heresy mad cat might not be missed and watching windows always felt like one allee vocal too far (after the superior and ) but the mushing the surviving tunes into bite-sized chunks is an unnecessary compromise here the track that least warrants revision suffers most: cuts straight to its climax cluttered with all the elements that the 97 reprazent introduced over a restrained nine minutes and in less than half that time it burns itself out se skip-to-the-money-shot edits do away with the tracks best parts (the foreplay) but they are at least clear attempts to reposition them for modern dancefloors which size demonstrates by mixing some together himself understandable is what he refers to as adding a new coat armour to tunes which remain otherwise uncut this amounts to no more than painting in the gaps formerly sparse productions like where the hyper beats and amorphous bassline are joined by string and horn sweeps which fit more neatly with the neo-jazz noodlings new tracks like the ironically named whether it s a rap anthem (current single don t ) or a live version ( ) the more roni size adds to the more he takes away s justification that fans the original album always appreciated what we did with the technology the day this latest version shows what is possible now reveals the flawed thinking at the heart this project the assumption that the spacious almost minimal sound the initial release was down to technological restrictions rather than aesthetic choices and that adding more into the mix is somehow an improvement if that were true all late 90s drum n bass would have sounded as stark as the first and all modern variants would sound as messy and unfocussed as the so-called deluxe edition
this is the fourth release on the mo s ferry sublabel with the previous three fast becoming collector s items pressed on 10 vinyl and limited to only 500 copies (the first three were 1000) each record is serial numbered and comes beautifully presented with stylish artwork r nyc and erlin artist friends will be impressed as they peruse your record collection but of course when it really comes down to it records are meant to be heard not seen thus all this posturing wont mean shit if it don t sound good ya dig fortunately and deliver sublimely describe their output as cute minimal electronica and s fits the bill nicely t has a cinematic quality to it evoking a contemplative scenario out of twin peaks with a slow peaceful groove it bristles with warmth leaving you with a sense of serenity f you are familiar with s live set you ll recognize elements at play here as the track is built from loops he s played during performances on the flipside is an equally calming down-tempo number the male delivery of the only line in the song ( found you ) layered over a bevy of broken beats and intelligent sequences the addition of a monster (yet soothing) bassline which pokes its head out every now and again complements proceedings nicely ll in all 04 is a record that would be proud to put on display to friends of all ilk whether they be artist snobs dm snobs or simply those who appreciate fine music
the success of s elegant mix of avant-garde electronica and classical piano is something to cheer about and he here hands over 2011s juno ep to two producers that are fully compatible with the german musician frahms original version of is like watching an arctic ice floe pass by its mournful synth drone having more than a hint of enos the big ship about it warp veteran clark sprays on a veneer of glitch for his remix which he augments with with burial-style muted beats its not overly interesting until the end when frahms glacial synths drop out leaving behind an almost tribal drum exercise is an analogue lullaby made up of fractals of echo-drenched synths luke turns into a nearly ten-minute epic its first minute has a decaying synth hum that gently morphs into a mesh of exquisite competing melodies the track ends as a lazy trudge through fields of woody percussion and the drip of gamelan-style xylophones its one of the loveliest things the border community artist has ever done
if you cast your mind back to 2012 you may recall vancouverite duo and their wintry debut sayso the title track made a minor splash at the time and with good reason but with so-called alt r b (sigh) practically an established market category these days its marriage of dubstep heft and hip-winding sensuality now seems a touch naive still the magnetism of evelyn masons husky tones suggested that the project might have legs and on that singles long awaited follow-up she and producer jeremiah klein prove that indeed it does several new waters are tested here (none of them remotely sub-weeknd) and the results are intriguing and often excellent best is the title track which proposes an alternate history in which my bloody valentine made sexy synth slow-jams its chords buzz shimmer and sag in the heat coming out both warm and dislocated all at once its a highly unusual and seductive sound and one of which we hopefully havent heard the last is completely different but almost as pretty its subtle dub undulations suggest the duo have been listening to rhythm und but the results are intricate and pop-wise enough to transcend homage the other half of the record isnt so convincing swaps dense arrangements for extreme sparseness and masons voice isnt quite forceful enough to carry the drama like soft its also noir-ish and relentlessly maudlin when it seems do glimmering beauty best
s second album comes with some baggage his first released only last year was called seapunk and was meant to define accidental internet movement that quickly became butt of ridicule and has since been widely dismissed as a fad when i spoke with him last month albert redwine defended seapunk claiming it was distorted beyond its original intention s hard to view where focus turns to a kind of fucked-up jungle landscape with deteriorating cities giant robots people trying to use magic in ir everyday lives outside shadow of seapunks rise and fall musically not all that much has changed but while its still informed by deep house breaks grime and trance redwines songwriting has become tighter and more confident is a bustling diverse record but its building blocks are consistent enough that it doesnt feel fragmented like seapunk itself which was always hard to pin down but had consistent attributes redwines sound is inherently hyperactive seizing on dumb happiness of donk note as a central device most of his melodies are delivered in its distinctive bomp-bomp-bomp cadence res a zaniness to this music: honking brass on sounds mischievous and cartoonish basslines on catchy surge forward like yre too excited to bo r keeping in time he touches on grime with more reflective along with cocking gun sounds and stra:mentals no future sample and harder title track which mixes boxed-style abstraction with rough edges of early neptunes productions o r times he just sounds like himself is like a vintage chicago house track with wacky percussive accents that sound like woodpeckers res a frenetic charm to that funnily enough looks back to appeal of early seapunk when it was new and exciting (especially s first few mixes) even as it shies away from overt references to movement where his last album felt slow and hesitant this one zooms through each track blurring borders between m and climaxing with a jungle blitz in to n we get closer which samples a low-quality clip of queen song of same name s knowingly sloppy and a sarcastic wink at end of an album that consistently juggles seriousness and humour energetic and ligh arted shows off redwines unique personality as for that baggage well you dont need to know or care what seapunk is to enjoy it
is nadia dalo and benedikt frey both of whom recently appeared on the title track of massimiliano pagliaras album you might recognize frey from a run of 12-inches a couple of years back which ran the gamut from playful to stony-faced now hes teamed up with dalo and signed to spanish label their debut as precedes an album later in the year and it takes freys dressed-down techno and clothes it in a sleek goth-tinged style both original tracks are monstrous slow-burners the zombie march of has a whiff of new beat to it but the energy the track works up is dissipated in its free-floating breakdown once it resumes even the acid line they let loose feels torpid the faster brighter melts into an ethereal passage with angelic vocals from dalo while heady synths fizz with the feel of krautrock the duo are more engaging when they lean on dalos voice (as opposed to the apathetic chanting on ) willie riffs on s vintage quality for his remix the new yorker smooths out the tracks ominous demeanour into a chirpy boogie adding playful leads that double-up and branch off into unexpected notes cliff s more simplistic rework underlines the existing dread with some sulking basslines and post-punk reverb giving it a tinted-windows shade c p i another duo whose epic el t nel was the labels finest moment last year offer the pick of the litter with their version of which has a wiry new bassline and an even more dramatically silent breakdown are slightly overshadowed by their remixers but this solid debut holds promise for their upcoming lp
s debut album is supposed to be all about following your inspiration which for the uk duo means an old-school take on drum bass technicolour komatic have already proven their gift for crafting smooth-as-silk rollers and with theyve taken that approach back to the old days building a rich sound full of horns strings pianos and soulful vocals its a good match for who have been inching towards the pop-friendly corner of drum bass with every passing year but it also lacks the labels typical spirit of progression you can only look so far into the past before it becomes nostalgic or even reductive and is on the way there repackaging old ideas with modern sensibilities of course that doesnt have to be a bad thing s world of sumptuous orchestration is easy to get sucked into and theyve packed their dense arrangements with little instrumental flourishes duo mostly keep themselves grounded like on the bell-heavy banger or the gorgeous which sounds like an old film score rolled up into a drum bass track but sometimes get carried away for instance by taking the plaintive beauty of and throwing in some cheesy vocals about the power of music other tracks like imperfections and suffer the same fate as blandly soulful vocals detract from the otherwise careful arrangements rest of the album redeems those missteps succeeding especially when go for broke s is a rhapsodic endorphin overload in the vein of the brookes brothers classic tear you down caning a filtered sample before letting the drums steamroll in for the albums only unrestrained moment s meanwhile finishes the lp with a welcome lashing of jungle breaks hearkening back to the potent formula that the duo nailed with last years intersection ep its the best example of their good records-influenced style and it ends on a triumphant high note a group obsessed with cultivating the smoothest sounds possible it follows that s album should be impeccably sequenced too y break up the flow of rollers with interludes and stylistic diversions like the finger-snapping rhythms on or the funky guitar work on professionally arranged and complete with a feel-good happy ending is a lot like the hollywood movies it takes so many sonic cues from: you may need to suspend disbelief to get past the over-the-top emotions but the high production values make it worth a go

from drumnbass to breakbeats and now to ragga infused 2-step aquasky vs masterblaster certainly can do no wrong especially when their releases are of this quality - chunky basslines a syncopated yet very danceable beat complimented by 2 awesome ragga mcs this release certainly makes those so solid crew boys feel brittle side a feat the ragga twins starting off on a mellow vibe this song has all the elements of a 2-step track - broken beats syncopated hi-hats and the mcs come in after a short introduction to warm up the track once the beat starts to build up you know its all over bamm the bass line kicks in hard as ever and the kick drums pound away like listening to your hearbeat through a stethoscope - it is that deep and full of bass but what is it about ragga mc-ing i cant understand a word their saying still it is enough to make anyone shake some ass side b (masterblaster dub remix) for those who cant handle ragga mc-ing are then treated to a dub mix on the b-side this is not an instrumental mix where the vocals are simply lifted off the original track this is a dub remix where the track has been remixed and the vocals appear in minimal form or sometimes not at all starting off with a sample declaring that were back up and running completely untouchable and a sample that sounds like theyve recorded someone playing with a touchtone phone this remix is more of a breakbeat vibe than 2-step and feels a lot softer compared to the harsh deep and bassy feel of the original aquasky vs masterblaster have proven themselves to the breakbeat heads that not only can they produce mad drumnbass beats but also their production skills with the slower breaks and 2-step tracks are worth checking out as well this is one of the singles from the new lp beat the system and if this is anything to go by then it should be worth checking out

one of 2004s biggest breakbeat anthems s the bump grind gets the chop and rehash by two breakbeat masterchefs - breakspoll 2004s best dj krafty kuts and the abrasive italian santos the original tune was instantly recognisable by its boom boom bap vocal hook and a party flavoured beat that in some ways leant towards the b-boy (dare i say it) big beat styles of the late 90s side a krafty kuts remix kraftys version elevates the tune from a feelgood party anthem to a big stadium rocker incorporating a massive synth hook dropping more percussion into the break at the same time dispensing of the wild thing drum fills from the original bits of extra hip hop vocals get dropped into the mix which is typical of kraftys style and he chops up the vocal hook to give different variations on the theme one noticable feature of the original was the ear drum splitting buildup which in many cases would have listeners wincing and pulling faces to the sounds of screeching stabs - pure k-hole mayhem in turn krafty makes use of this and ends up incorporating it into the tune side b santos remix santos version takes a more progressive route sounding slighty darker and more serious the intro utilises a drum break and the vocal hook while santos cuts in various tech stabs and progressively adds in more elements while giving the vocal hook his own variation - passing it through filters the build up from the original tune is disguised in the mix incorporated as background noise and is accompanied by haunting stabs - a santos trademark by the halfway mark the tune has built up into one noisy monster charged up on adrenalin fueled bass to be quite honest i never got into the original version as much as i did this - the remixes and especially kraftys version make for a much better tune
bobby krlics first album as came out on aurora borealis a metal-focused label thats also home to justin broadrick and ktl hes since moved in a more electronic direction bridging the gap between the noisy spasms of cut hands and the dignified doom of raime his second full-length and first for sits perfectly in the middle where krlics first album seemed consumed by a fear of death is reportedly meant to survey the vastness of the afterlife this concept penetrates deep into the albums sound: gone are the earthen strings and woodwinds the hideous shudder that made his earlier music so frighteningly lifelike instead we get negative space labyrinthine composition and synth-driven melodies that explode from quiet to loud like a thriller soundtrack it doesnt make an effort to grab you unless its by the throat like the low-end depth charges that shake up the sludgy squirm of krlic takes full advantage of the album form often stretching his songs to more than ten minutes result is something truly narrative this isnt the kind of record youd play on shuffle in the title tracks two parts were taken through a sonorous tunnel only to be dumped into an empty pit of despair all static and hissing hellmouths with ing those dissociative drones collect themselves back into fire-and-brimstone techno se longer sections are punctuated by pockets of sonic violence such as and interludes that feel like vignettes between the longer passages of plot development even with dissonant screeches and static is always more thrilling than it is alienating its not just neutered noise music its extreme but theres something in his touch that renders it approachable and emotive instead of antisocial its a tendency that takes over on the 13-minute closer where a simple riff unravels itself in sandpapery tones growing more devastated with every turn considering what came before it feels rebellious almost post-rock a sudden return of the organic textures from his first album more importantly its a stirring finale cutting to the bone not with horror or violence but pure emotion he might have translated his sound into electronics with but here krlics music feels more wrenchingly human than it ever has been
so many people who love house and techno will have wanted this record to blow them away i was one of them the very idea of firing forth one of his jazzy techno epics on just feels so utterly right the narrative so enticing first of all theres that backstory which may already seem like youve heard it a hundred times: garnier played panorama ar with dixon and played this record whereupon the boss signed it on the spot in celebration he then recorded another special to put on the six weeks later it arrives triumphantly even the title seems perfect for a post-minimal scene wrestling with a fetish for all things purist and retro the truth is that this record could only be more romantic if garnier proposed to a girlfriend via the sleevenotes nd so you desperately want the music to be both reverent and mindblowing to slot into now but grab you like dangerous drive or man with the red face or sound of the ig abou did what a shame then that it doesnt this isnt an awful record but its a terribly bloated one theres certainly a bombast to but its a stadium bombast the more kitchen sinks garnier flings into this sprawling opus the more it feels like the over-complicated return of a behemoth like a mini chinese democracy s for the music itself it sounds like some far flung cosmic breakbeat in places its even like the chemical rothers if they had goatees and berets instead of the hoodies some weird funk-laden macho mess is this what justice would sound like if they liked jazz on the flip the is closer to garniers traditional bassline techno and if you want a weak nicotine patch for man with the red face then perhaps this is for you ut once again its overcomplicated divorced from club culture and very difficult to imagine dancing to overall this feels like some form of what used to be called prog or tribal coupled with a stern and starched lesson in musicality granted few artists would attempt such a sprawling opus but intention is one thing execution another

the aesthetic of and its founder bill kouligas could be said to perfectly encapsulate where were at in late : a place where homespun experimentalism and the academic avant-garde meld with visceral body music in new and unexpected ways releases from nhkkoyxen heatsick snd and others have been among the finest of the year but it seems that kouligas has saved his best till last in the past month has delivered not one but two superlative records that both encapsulate the ethos and push it into new realms: first diversions 1994-1996 a 12-inch of jungle abstractions and now dutch tar plumes whats perhaps most remarkable about these two releases is how entirely distinct and yet accomplished each of them is where diversions ruminated on notions of memory decay and loss this lp is a forward-looking affair a singular take on dance floor mechanics which takes up the reins from gambles past work in more purist computer music realms theres no doubting that gambles previous discography is a presence here in its individual moments (the furtive modem-like burble of opening track for example) and its general sonic world: one of paper-thin but precise textures strange glitch-like sonic artifacts and nimble fiendishly complex structures the appeal of this lp lies in the adroit splicing of this aesthetic with that of dance floor techno a combination which has the potential to be horrifically stale sterile smug but ends up being anything but granted gamble does offer up a few more sedentary workouts: the gorgeously windswept ; s deep-space plangency; desolate closer but more or less everything else is animated by a pulse and a kick drum of sorts allowing gamble to approach techno conventions from multiple angles pins down its stumbling refracted synth patterns with a malfunctioning slow-mo throb while is a druggier affair its synths oozing and swirling ceaselessly has something of the airiness of dub techno but those keenly degraded pads labouring under a hiss somewhere between tape crunch and a low-bitrate mp3 steadily crumble under a galloping percussive onslaught the seemingly disparate sounds beginning to throb and wheeze in unison in a masterful sleight of hand often its the unpredictability of these tracks that makes them so fascinating take whose thunderous kick and percussive filigree perpetually hove in and out of view with impressive fluidity but its also more fundamentally gambles innate understanding of techno as a subjective experience is built around a beautiful winding synth passage that sends reverb tails off into the murk; before long though a hi-hat strafes down from on high leaving a cloud of particulate noise in its wake that consumes the mix its an effect which would never work on the dance floor and yet its incredibly astute in its simulation of the peak time experience gamble may approach techno as an outsider but his contribution is not to be ignored
people seem to get excited about stephan laubners diligent fascination with sound given the habitual singularity of the end product its understandable laubner himself makes no bones about its importance to his work and frequently uses every inch of vinyl space to squeeze on mini catalogues of single-bar loops tracks proper are deliberately long and mesmerising so that his adept programming can be afforded its dues no waveform is an island however music would of course be nothing without sound but the reverse is also true and it is a consummate understanding of this symbiosis that prevails on s latest record for sound for the most part is certainly not pretty unkempt kicks and grubby trebles in are rather ruggedly handsome eccentric melodies in the bass and upper ends are similarly unsubtle but at once adroit might be daringly haywire but theres no pussyfooting on this jam track paves the way for laubners evident improvisation to be contorted further on tracks and both of which owe as much to miles davis as they do to dr moog but not without a couple of less spontaneous interludes a-sides mini track is a teasing workout in p-funk with its jellified bassline and rusty string pings it sounds like a dr dre sample you wish would go on just a bit longer but that would be easy; its too much like something youve already heard before although it plies more traditional harmonies is anything but chords descend a minor scale like a slinky over organ pipes stuffed with feathers while all sorts of metallic hits are arranged into a beat that jack built laubner likes to string things out and fair enough: this could go on all day
a new label born out of the same ristol record shop space as punch drunk records begins its story with this first vinyl release a two-tracker by an unnamed producer further clouding the soup the tunes are simply named and oth productions lie on the minimal side sharing rich thick basslines with percussion that tumbles through variant measures of delay assumes the lead role on the release becoming positively buoyant as the sine wave bass scythes into action dding the kind of maddening synth lines that either bubble constantly or swipe at predetermined intervals invites comparisons to pinch or ppleblim but its the mechanic layers of repetition that scrawl the much-needed depth behind the stripped back lines of melody and make it such an insistent listen scuppers the linear streamlined arc of s riffs instantly hitting out with a cropped guitar sample on every note eventually the guitar line dissipates diluting itself through bass pulses as glassy samba-flecked percussion peppers the mix before a precise kick thump takes the guitars place trading off the switch with hyper-delayed horn stabs
sparse doesnt even come close to adequately describing s latest on the vinyl-only offshoot of germanys minimood label sparking into sombre life with a fizz of white noise and ominous hums ploughs a relatively linear path but steps up half a gear at its mid-point after the introduction of a few organic creaks single undulating synth that adds both depth and warmth where the original is straight down the line sascha s remix is all about the groove complemented with the dollop of off-kilter unease youd expect from the german producer despite a longer runtime than its source material the track never outstays its welcome with steadily layered percussion and intricately panned synth wobbles building a tension that never quite peaks instead it fades into a unresolved finale that leaves you wondering if it was ever there in the first place
theres a undeniable thread that binds and its artists yet label boss spokesman and mainline protagonist kode 9 has gone on record numerous times to say that he cant really put his finger on exactly what it is when he finds it he says he simply knows it upon release of s debut 12-inch for label please what was immediately evident was her individuality with that single sara abdel-hamid merged nonsense melodics of skweee with lashings of bass weight and some purposefully primitive galloping drums creating her own strain of bastardised bass music virus early contact love want have highlight sets tone for full-length contorting in typical fashion with her cheap sounding syn sizers bumbling around a steady bass drum pulse unfurling into a homage to percussive textures of uk funky as snare drums patter she propels chorus section with slow thick bass tones and kind of melodic interplay that belongs amongst a bustling arcade but melody isnt only concern: has positioned herself at forefront of outsider dance and rhythm is just as important personifies s approach to it perfectly pumping off a bold shoulder pad touting riff she keeps her groove regimented to 4x4 kick splaying snares in erratic cyphers across gurgles and uplifting pads singles and opinion-splitting latter of which is an exercise in incredibly high pitched manipulation booming sine waves and succulent chords chops are all included before halfway respite of continue a track that feels like s suitably warped slow jam lullaby layered with whistles snatched vocals and same kind of snare snap you find stamped deep into everything joker produces her ability to drive dance floors is captured at peak of album in triplicate and all crank drum patterns up to incredibly insistent; and while takes a more eyes-down introspective route with cascading synths often completely bleaching tone out of drums in places it like final chapter of album belongs on a big rig in a compact room the drum work on contact is rough and intentionally so ready to pummel you from a finely tweaked bassbin but its s approach to melody and way she layers her syn sizers that is undoubtedly most exciting thing about this full-length there are moments when tones bleed a bit too much sometimes eclipsing rhythm and at times rigid stylophone lead line approach feels more angular and precarious than it need be but contact love want have is a collection of work by someone who revels in se approaches unworried by ir potential genre compatibility a superbly strong and relentlessly inventive debut album

we ve seen a surge of scaffolded deep sounds coming out of erlin lately hard wax and affiliated kreuzbergians have been mining the seam of 90s chain reaction: note marcel dettmann s recent atmospheric arrangements; torsten pr frock s (t++ ) sub-dub takes on dettmann s mdr (fattened with copious reverb and delay); monolake and sleeparchive as ever keeping their respective fingers on the 4/4 with grainy echo-techno topping the lot chain reaction progenitors scion launched their new imprint scionversions at the end of last year now teamed as substance and vainqueur rather than scion peter kuschnereit (substance) and rene lowe (vainqueur) have just released their second 12 the new label s debut record surface/immersion was a welcome follow-up a dozen years on from scion s first release emerge the deep spacious mood of their signature sound maintained as though there d been no interval the new instalment / is drawn from the same glassy deep pool and like surface/immersion it delves into (even more) dubbed and shadowy territory than the piquant 95 release side drifts though variations on a reverb theme metallic sprays breeze though the steady groove while it doesn t have the skittering pace and depth of immersion its freshness is like cool air on a crowded floor the b-side atmosphere is comparatively sunken the beats are more turbulent and the delicate reverb structures more sepulchral flickering in the shadows nother chapter of the kind of peerless rarefied sounds produced only in this corner of the world looking forward to the imminent sv03: remix chapter one with sleeparchive and ritish murder oys (aka surgeon and regis) taking scionversions into darker harder territory

you may not hear the name these days unless you happen to catch an old dubstep fan in a wistful moment the producer went quiet in 2008 during his prior mid-00s golden run he injected a broken beat sensibility into the nascent dubstep sound to produce something unique as the styles anything-goes attitude gave way to a handful of defined sub-genres records like 2004s the knowledge hinted at lost possibilities on this unexpected return for the london label its as if no time has passed at all s beats remain broken and heavy-footed while his basslines are woofer-rattling and his arrangements are thick with synthetic atmosphere the turbulent romantic mood recalls another former dubstep innovator kuedo but s sound hasnt dated brilliantly and on occasion the ep sounds a bum note in particular overdoes it the lead line is pungent and the beat is clumsy but the other tracks stand up better s drums are rusted as if from a decade of neglect and its forlorn synths and rave chords swirl in an ocean of reverb after a couple of minutes it crests into a bittersweet breakdown of near-burial proportions meanwhile swaps the darkness for light theres a grand euphoria to its cloudburst synths which threaten to outshine the nifty breakbeat underneath
if god could sing he would have a voice like robert owens id magazine once claimed the now defunct muzik called him the voice of house music and for a while during the 90s both seemed totally legitimate; rarely could you visit a club without your ears being gently massaged by owens rich harmonics on this new production new zealander hugo barritt keeps both his arrangement and the musical palette simple heightening the impact of the occasional vocal as a result dreamily hypnotic with a swirling metallic synth that shoulders much of the burden of rhythm its quietly confident in its ability to convey plenty without saying all that much efdemins cranks up the energy levels several notches but its still on the surface at least a relatively subdued affair pulsing organs rising and falling like billowing clouds of mist give the track a distinctly vaporous quality but its all driven along by a typically determined kick/bass combo so unyielding in its goal you could hardly describe the overall effect as tranquil tom s mix is fine as good an example as any of the wandering bassline that just cant help flicking its head up above the low pass a few times each circuit but it just doesnt compare with the discreet subtlety of barritt and efdemins efforts
an interesting release here on with an all turkish trio of mert yucel goknil sarp all combining efforts to deliver two new tracks for the imprint the a-side estranged sees the trio deliver a building and journey like production as the track continually flows with the introduction of sweeping effects and solid beats and percussion the track does plod along in a similar vein for too long one must say but it is quite good in the latter half somewhat making up for the lack of direction in the first half fade away introduces a little more of a melodic influence with some very nice string patterns and a cheeky melodic riff but it you can t help but feel that the production is a little dated and has been heard before not an entirely bad release here on but it s a two tracker that won t leave a long lasting impression
i first heard about runddans in 2012 when i was visiting the norwegian city stavanger for a music conference emil nikolaisen the alt-rock band serena-maneesh was giving a presentation on his unconventional production style partway through the talk he excitedly announced that he and lindstr m who was playing later in the week had begun work on a project with none other than todd rundgren this sounded like a great idea given the debt that both norwegian artists owe to this maverick figure: nikolaisen as an auteur producer whose wild studio techniques ought to make more waves than they do and lindstr m as an ambassador for rundgrens brand prog excess runddanss title is a reference to the man himself course but it also incorporates the norwegian word for round and thats just what the album is: a single circular composition dancing endlessly around the same material with each revolution comes a fresh gaggle instruments synths beget guitars beget woodwinds and vibraphones outlining everything from celestial rock ( ) to weirdo lounge-pop ( ) tying it all together is a single chord progression a stargazing loop straight out the lindstr m playbook much like something from smallhans it creates the illusion perpetual uplift building anticipation for some glorious climax unlike on that album such a climax never comes it all starts so well opener irth is chill-inducing a roiling cloud tones and gleaming wholetone scales s the chord progression first shimmers into motion on and a 4/4 pulse throbs low in the mix it seems as if were on the brink prog-disco euphoria stead we lurch into a cacophony edited drum fills before being dumped out into the aimless this dynamic repeats several times and each time its more frustrating moments studio bombast when they come are too messy and indistinct to give nikolaisens production chops a fair showing even worse the drums remain thin and muffled when one lindstr ms full-fat disco thuds might have been just the bedrock the album sorely needs when rundgren worries about drawing the audience in on the phone call-sampling its not drums hes talking about but vocals se he supplies himself first in a wordless croon (on the meandering ) and then with a few lines phoned-in pop romanticism that become the albums central theme this theme delivered in a strained falsetto is the records cheesiest component and its largest flaw it serves as a reminder that the rundgren worshipped by younger musicians like nikolaisen and lindstr m the mid-70s rundgren say itiation is not the same as present day rundgren who dabbled in edm-pop on 2013s state runddans is an intriguing and sometimes fun experiment but its not quite a meeting great musical minds pessimist might say that theyve missed one another by a few decades
s prowess for grand atmospheric house and s knack for the unpredictable pay dividends here on the nglo italian collaboration construct a slow burner that uses helicopter blade percussion and echoing eastern xylophones for its opening third it gradually blooms through portentous analogue keys and snapping snares into a witching hour weapon its a track with a mesmeric show stopping quality but executed with subtlety and understatement is left to his own devices on athed in echo with primeval digital toms riddling its spine its embellished with beautifully strange monophonic synths and dashes of acid modulation its the sort of quirky offering that this singular producer is quietly gaining a reputation for
has always been the most cheerful of the mild pitch crew take a listen to early work on labels like so sound and smokestack and youll hear a funky producer that stands apart from dplay and langenbergs more refined aesthetic foolin turs latest for delusions of grandeur will do nothing to dispel such perceptions it has the more modern drive that characterizes turs productions but slots neatly next to most of this moment as a big room tune that rides the thin line between kraft and gouda foolin s got a better (uncredited) vocal than its freerange predecessor and it makes all the difference wandering bassline that seems to come back to drive its point home helps too tur gets pensive on the flip with and sounds a bit like culoe de song in the process he thankfully doesnt go full tribal with a chanting vocal instead opting for a horn fanfare strangely though its somehow too full of itself and not full enough simultaneously on this one stick with the cheese for better or worse
the number of undiscovered gems sitting on dusty d t tapes in even dustier lofts must surely be dwindling by the day but there are still plenty of labels dedicated to mining those remaining corners parisian imprint does it better than most the labels debut release s tapes featured three tracks of visceral chugging techno produced in 1992 and forgotten for two decades it was strange and original enough to catch the ear and it also had an interesting backstory: real name gwen jamois is an old affiliate of phex twin who decided against submitting the tapes material to rephlex in the early 90s because it was too 4/4 jamois who now co-runs with quentin vandewalle is back at the helm for the labels fourth outing strangely the 12-inch contains two identical pieces of music with the same 22-minute title track on both sides s with tapes it was produced in the early 90s but never released and sounds like its been cut from a jam session lasting several hours the overdriven kick drums bristle with the funk of early downwards but the chords are more in line with star-gazing detroit techno the tracks parts feel like theyre perennially on the verge of drifting off as if jamois was straining to keep them in check ut as it rumbles on he works the filters and locks into a groove its easy to imagine getting lost in for much longer than 22 minutes </ahref
is perhaps the personification of a restless artist: never one to quietly rest on his laurels and certainly not looking to gracefully ease into the twilight of a truly remarkable career man like continues to polarize his fans and challenge the very fiber of dance music with his re imagining of the craft that made him a household name jury is still out on volver and fundacion which are loved and loathed equally by the progressive fraternity sit somewhere in between seeing moments of undeniable genius and follies caused by a producer experimenting with new gear has no such room for flaws ts cool and confident evidence of years of tireless touring and it expertly forges the best of volver fundacion and the harder end of his northern exposure mixes to conjure a sonic storm of fluttering ecstacy and deep melancholy that is undeniably ts easily his best release since taking on the digital mantra and although it revels in having a darker and more linear agenda its expert pace and flawless sequencing packs more than enough emotional thrills to lock you in over the entire set dytron and all feature as well as old friend and airdrawndagger collaborator but their craft is reshaped expertly by s sorcery opener the in the by underpins a lush arpeggio of warm synths with mournful vocals that sail beautifully through a gentle chug of sparse percussion toughens things up with the fluid tech of montagues its disarming rekids style siren coaxing you into the finger wagging house stomp of s lowlife s offers a northern exposure intermission of sorts with its gorgeous flicker of breakbeats and gasping chords but offers little reprieve launching into a rolling progressive take on s sublime he hits the snooze button with the trance infected by but by god he hits his straps with a closing magic bracket thats up there with his best starting with dytrons a snarling electro monster that snaps and writhes under broken and wailing synths and a dominatrix vocal line grabs you by your sweaty hair and pulls you through a dark sonic tunnel into the blinding china white light of s incredible what ensues is one of the best mash ups of this year as flicks on the strobe and unleashes s haunting vocals from over s gargantuan arsenal of emotive synths (a full circle moment from a guy who used to throw whitney houston a cappellas over talo house ) as the sparse chords of swing through his own cut and you realize there are no electroclash shockers to come taking in the lights up anthemic feel of by is almost a relief and an apt way to close out a magnificent set
is the debut release from a trio comprising some of technos most consistent artists svreca runs the esteemed semantica records and as his recent resident advisor podcast showed is an exceptional dj as voices from lake donato dozzy and neel are best known for atmospheric techno but arrives on their label for more upbeat material this ep strikes a happy medium between svrecas versatility and voices from lakes singular style on and arpeggios dazzle and kick drums bang within the muggy atmospheres we associate with dozzy and neel se tracks are a complementary pair the lead on is tense and icy whereas the pitched-down equivalent on furrows at more aggressive angles on drums bounce in irregular patterns like a dribbled basketball underneath a grinding sound sometimes close sometimes distant encircles you in an oval-shaped loop s cunning is rhythmic instead of spatial its bleepy lead is gristly and squashed and for the first few moments youll wonder why the beat which is 5/4 in double-time is so hard to catch look at that a vocal sample says as though in amazement

the many records released on l i e s since it launched five years ago few have summed up the labels personality as well as s false memories sprawling and sometimes brutal the lp collected cabrals early musical experiments some of which he didnt remember making its jagged flow and chewed-up tape sound reignited an abrasive streak that cabral would further explore on his harsh house records as chemotex with cabral has nearly equalled false memories recreating that albums amateurish spirit with the caustic compounds he dabbled in as chemotex even for a label that epitomizes the idea of the raw analogue hardware jam is raw theres an upfront quality that evokes the old punk rock method of recording right to the mixing board these tracks dont sound like theyve ever seen a computer t its coarsest is hostile: shallow for example is a drum workout with a virulent acid line and hectic snare rolls that hiss like rattlesnakes those snares resonant and cutting are the lps most distinctive sound they feel like they might slice through your eardrums on thats its this approach uncomfortably close and piercing that goes beyond lo-fi and sharpens common dance music devices into weapons what has in texture it lacks in structure but the unpredictability is part of the fun the opener moves with a slouch but the heaving basslines and high-pitched bleeps give it an explosive quality it often sounds like cabral is mixing volatile chemicals together and letting them fizz and foam all over the plodding drum track theres a similar instability to where distorted speech snippets crudely phase in and out over another uneasy groove while a coat of ugly fuzz slowly swallows the whole thing isnt easy listening and its not supposed to be few of these tracks might work in a dj set but that seems beside the point rather than channel his destructive impulses into fiery dance music cabrals second lp lets them fester and blaze even if it was made in a whole different era from false memories comes close to capturing what made that record such a wonderful anomaly its off-the-cuff occasionally brilliant and punk as fuck
cooler more conventional noise fans might shy away from sure enough the boisterous berlin label still pushes through the kind of aggy drum bass and breakcore it might be better known for but every now and then a deeper survey of their sound comes along recently that was stavros gasparatoss expanded piano a commissioned sound-art piece that aimed to recontextualise the piano and now theres simon hayess third swarm intelligence album and second full-length for after a handful of eps that toyed more closely with splintered and refracted breaks all that frantic energy cooled off for a bit on faction leaving huge creaking soundscapes in its wake the results were far more potent and impressive than any of its breakneck predecessors and hayes has continued to hone these dramatic forays into noise on subsequent releases the vistas have gotten tougher cleaner and more defined by grinding gears and scraping metal its not crude but rather very precise and calculated both meticulous and menacing which is what makes an about-turn of sorts: this is a dirtier scuffed up swarm intelligence that feels much closer to the source theres a rich earthliness to tracks are built from field recordings of abandoned power stations and factories corroded metal and found objects which are overhauled into dense booming techno ( ) or left in a bare state free to roam in their captured sounds ( ) at times it can get eerily beautiful like on the melancholic some of hayess previous work can feel a bit clinical but not here everythings been unscrewed a little the last three swarm intelligence records were far from easy listening but they were altogether fluid thats not the case with this is for better or worse a much more disjointed album by confining himself to a strict concept hayes may have cheated himself out of what made black iron prison and faction more memorable but what lacks in expanse it makes up for in quality feel free to start here then backtrack through the discography for the full experience

following on from icarus this hard trance release is long awaited from and a must for anyone who enjoyed icarus when released the tune is a massive trance release with its pounding bassline sensational riff and of course the vocals following on icarus left his guide and drawn by a desire to reach the heavens took his course too high the burning heat of the nearby sun softened the scented wax that fastened the wings and the wax melted icarus moved his arms now uncovered and without the wings to drive him on vainly beat the air the sea received icarus and from him took its name do not miss this tune

launched just months ago is a newborn in music terms yet the nascent berlin label seems to have got past the crawling stage in double quick time combining a neat line in colourful and slightly trippy original cover art with a love of deep melodic house s three previous releases have already turned the heads of the likes of luciano me and claude vonstroke moscow producer should open the fanbase out further with three fluid sun-dappled house cuts a parping dubby synth line is spliced to an organic funk bass refrain that rises and falls driven by a trippy looped synth is more demure about letting go; it locks into a laidback groove replete with filtered synths gallic-style vocal sample and intricate itchy rhythm nd if the previous two tracks shows has grasped the funk baton is evidence he can delve into twisted more paranoid corners with a swirling angry synth loop butting up to a whipcracking garagey rhythm track
its 2012 and that brand of uk-bred dance music without a name (the one no ones still particularly comfortable calling bass music ) is weighed down by unimaginative kids in their bedrooms aping the tropes of their favourite producers 808 samples aside the most overused of those tropes have to be the r b vocals theres nothing wrong with revaluation and rediscovery a lot of these kids probably werent into aliyah brandy and ciara until they realised that their favourite artists were sampling them and thats great but you can tell when people are sampling stuff because they think its the done thing as opposed to because it means something to them or because its the right thing for the track enter canadas sibian and faun their debut single for is effectively an edit of shantis 2007 single hey baby re-pitching and chopping the originals vocal over muffled garage drums and joker-style crunchy purple bass on paper it sounds incredibly derivative and to be fair it is but its also done very very well what sibian and faun realise is that you can tick as many boxes as you want in terms of the elements that make up your tracks but if youre not structuring them in a way that results in swing tension build and release it means nothing sibian and faun bring im to a boil with a genuine sense of craftsmanship patience and song-writing guile that makes it damn hard to resist
its easy to lose sight of just how much thomas melchior has produced over his time within the music industry hes been refining his sound for roughly over 20 years this refinement is key though: if youre going to make music as inherently odd as his you need to get it right swinger takes a happy-go-lucky syncopated rhythm and sees jovial horns layered on top creating a pleasant house roller thats hard not to groove along to that is of course until halfway when he melts your head with a synth line that makes no discernable melodic sense this is where the experience comes to light: with a lesser producer this may sound forced or contrived but melchior reins it in just enough to create another signature wtf moment s takes the crown on this ep though with its bubbling muted bass and swung drums playing timekeeper to lewd mumblings that interchange with another oddball synth more refined than the more restrained too
the second disc to imagine by on follows on a very solid first disc that featured quality original mixes as well as one mix from u k with a whole new set of mixes by r:tem and boyko as well as another mix by finnish duo u k u k s v+t remix gets the ball rolling and on the whole it is slightly more upbeat and progressive as their mix on the first disc again nice solid chunky beats begin the track and not before too long a nice solid baseline sets the groove of the track an array of melodic tones soon make their presence riding over the beats as the track builds very nicely for the first half a nice quirky breakdown really sets it up for the remainder of the production to go all out as the main synth line from the original mix makes a welcome appearance following this i must say are two very nice set of loops particularly the second one which features the delicious baseline from the original mix first up on the flip is the r:tem boyko dub this is where the release probably gets at its grittiest as the beats and general mayhem is intensified the beats build alongside an edgy baseline and shortly enough some gritty guitar riffs roar their way into the production and really make the track their own the r:tem boyko dub follows this and essentially it is a bit more of the same with a alterations and additions probably not as gritty as the dub this mix also makes use of a very delicate breakdown as well as the main melodic synth from the original which gives this remix not quite as evil a result as the dub not a bad remix disc here from cuba with the r:tem and boyko remixes definitely adding a unique touch u k s remix probably edges it for me though on this disc
you might call ravedeath 1972 s goth record: suffused with death its haunting organ-driven meditations feel like yre drifting among tombstones on a sunless afternoon it seems man has gone inward taking contemplative grandeur and catharsis recent albums like symphonic gush harmony in ultraviolet or topographical expanse an imaginary country and re-applied it to a space that feels much more mournful by comparison doubt sound source has something to do with it: entire album is based on a live recording made a church pipe organ in a reykjavik and resulting studio manipulations feel heavily permeated by scene reflecting a kind icy solemnity spirituality winters solitude addition to album title a tracklist with phrases like music and underscores dark spirits that have been given reign and use specific dates seems like commemorations singular instances consigned to oblivion conceptual restraint does hecker well giving him a rich yet reduced sound palette which will appeal to fans his earlier work as well as likes fennesz and oneohtrix point never yet at same time invoking minimalist/maximalist organ works by terry riley and hermann nitsch one few traces heckers trademark distortion comes at opener where it enters in media res only to be swallowed by an ambient-trance cloud title appears to reference album art a strange and violent photograph a crowd flushed with jacobin energy hurling a piano f a ro image a clavier homicide only makes album title even more cryptic although apparently its a mystery even to hecker himself who accounted for phrase by saying he had no idea how it manifested sort ghostwritten like fingers on an ouija board its a description that fits listening experience as well as if youre receiving transmissions from parts unknown signals that lure you in only to overwhelm you three-part fog shows hecker at his strongest deploying electronic sound manipulation in a deft and organic way that parallels flux natural phenomena: shifting clusters looped samples invoke waterfalls movement wind across a plain kaleidoscopic patterns filtered light in a forest heckers compositions ten display a kind nimble density thick tides sound that wash over your ears but always manage to ebb away before you drown ravedeath 1972 begins with a piano falling and ends with air ano r three-parter that winds through disjointed keyboard plonk and heavy drone ending up in curlicues pealing bells tolling for some half-forgotten loss air also suggests that perhaps doomed piano actually never finally strikes ground remaining pitched earthward but suspended in a photographic freeze with iceland wind howling across its strings

is the american rep for non records an intercontinental collective dedicated to expressing the realities the african diaspora through music often this leads to politically-charged and hard-hitting tracks descriptions that fit amobi to a tee nons mission comes through in anyas an ep released in s freebie series (the same one that introduced arca back in 2012) its a snapshot what non and amobi are capable jarring and exciting in equal measure anyas is bookended by two versions the title track a classical piece made stately strings and bells yre appended with subtitles in classical music terms ( prelude fugue ) which is key to how they compare to the rest next to weaponized trap ( of ) autotuned chamber pop ( roneqah me ) and gorgeous soundscapes torn apart by machine gun fire ( of ) they feel stiff eps power is the juxtaposition beauty and violence on centrepiece of the strings from the title tracks are assaulted by broken glass high-pitched squalls and general chaos its willfully almost decadently destructive and its the purest example amobis vision: a dystopian narrative which is easy to parse even if you dont know about it amobis voice is obscured so you cant quite make out all the words like hes struggling to be heard and all the unrest that erupts is suppressed by the time we get to the second version anyas songs artificially perfect strings are almost menacing in their prettiness the second time around measured and conceptual compared to amobis past work anyas doesnt have the visceral thrill his best work though it does have its moments
when it comes to records is like a cyclone he sucks them up by the dozen and spits them back out sometimes intact (via discogs) sometimes mangled and jumbled up like on the bonesbreaks records bonesbreaks was a series of rambunctious sample-happy dj tools that ran from the late 80s through the 90s n january more than a decade since the last edition (and 11 years since boness last ep) it made a surprise comeback with a two-part ep of dope breaks for djs released on f this sounds like a trip down memory lane thats because it is one of the more recent samples here is from a track nearly ten years old: carl craigs remix of junior boys like a child which incidentally makes for one of the records biggest cuts ( ) for the most part though boness formula has aged well possibly because it draws from an era rarely referenced in clubs today with its electro-flavored breaks and samples from warriors is pure retro-mania but its explosive drums (lifted from tesselas horizon ) are hard to deny of course how much is too much is a matter of taste for some will be the clear winner here for others its main hook the twin peaks strings in mobys go will be a sample of a sample too far not all the tracks have this mash-up quality ory and drum up a rowdy vibe without such obvious source material all in all these records are just a lark a veteran artist taking one of his old ideas for a spin subtler selectors may roll their eyes but party djs will find plenty to love here
dave clark is one of those producers found in every great music city whos played a key role in shaping its scene without ever becoming widely known away from home turf operating out of glasgow for two decades now clark has recorded consistently excellent electronic music as truffle club in bands like big ned and state of flux and as one half of the optimo (espacio) remix duo alongside jd twitch under his new alias finds him strolling through various strains of house techno and electro in assured fashion standout track (named after the scottish founder of the 300-year-old piano manufacturer sons) is a gloriously loose-limbed house workout that pairs a todd terje-style piano line with soaring synths and a louche vocal loop the title track and dont offer different takes on moody warehouse techno the former ushers in chilly synths that perfectly complement its clattering percussion the latter is even more ominous perfect for bouncing off sweaty walls in the dark ep closer pings rubbery synths against a backdrop of cloud-gazing pads and fleet-footed percussion to create a brisk shiny electro nugget
wanted to make a record that returned to the core values of dance music says marea stamper of her first original production since 2013 ts not the first time has used this turn of phrase speaking to r s ndrew ryce in 2014 about her residency at chicagos smart bar where she was formerly a booker she talked about returning to the core values of inclusion and pure dance euphoria since then stampers star has risen fast but her relationship to dance music tradition has remained the same ts not your usual obscurer-than-thou cratedigger ethos though stamper embraces the dance music canon in its most broadly understood form shell happily close a panorama bar set with bucketheads bomb drop ts raining men (at glastonburys nyc downlow) or draw for a pitched-down bells (at dekmantel) r productions are similarly gung-ho tackling disco classics ( stand on word on 2012s exodus ) and acid house anthems (2013s references doniss no way back ) but where her dj sets deploy canonical greats with style and pinpoint accuracy stampers aim as a producer isnt always so true is dedicated to a string of disco legends larry levan walter gibbons loleatta holloway and it revives the style in its most melodramatic form res a sweeping sentimental piano intro and swelling strings throughout; the tracks spine is a moroder-like synth bassline ts all bound together with an ear for a hook mostly concentrated on the moment after three and a half minutes when the left hand of the piano starts to walk but in the end falls between two zones t lacks the lavishness of a period-faithful homage but the broad-brushstrokes arrangement offers little fresh insight on these familiar elements strings sound flat and the drums kind of thin structure is marred by clunky moments like the harmonic detour shortly before the six-minute mark and the shrill closing piano solo regardless stamper will no doubt make this track a highlight of her sets shes done much more with less outside of that context its hard to hear her singular magic in it
in case it wasnt obvious athens is the european equivalent to american labels like l i e s and w t sharing many of the same artists and a similar aesthetic recording as connecticuts jon beall made his solo debut for w t on 2010s la caccia an ep that shifted between old-school house and scuffed cosmic synth workouts on the aptly titled he revisits these styles more than perhaps anyone else whos released for those labels beall can sound a lot like legowelt a listen to the title tracks tightly-wound leading synth might have you wondering if is one of danny wolferss thousand side projects it should be noted however that hes utilizing that producers qualities namely crusty warbling synthesizers and a driving sense of momentum rather than making carbon copies the b-side especially shows him striking out on his own for follows a quirky pitched-up vocal intro with acidic jack moves while shows him manipulating those wolfers-esque elements into a beautifully foggy interplay beall may wear his influences on his sleeve but he ably channels them into painterly live-sounding tracks
is one of two names under which legowelt and xosar collaborated a few years back the other was trackman lafonte bonquiqui a home for kitschy sun-soaked pacific house releases were a little more serious their thumping house chassis softened with reverb and wooly melody this return to the alias after a two-year absence for nycs occupies much the same coordinates the pair do best when they balance foggy gloom and gentle house-wise euphoria blizzard 21122012 with its spooky chords and crypt-sized reverb feels a bit oppressive better is whose church-organ chords waft by like the dark clouds of its title still the percussive backing is on the sluggish side and finally hit the sweet spot the former with its dulled flutelike leads is one part bleak to two parts louche; the latter is more straightforwardly pretty both producers have proven themselves experts in rich layered melody and theyre on solid form here

is a bit of a shapeshifter in terms of genre but if theres a hallmark to his work its an elusiveness much of it sounds like hes making it all behind a screen with only a silhouette to show that somebody is indeed there his two releases on so far both sit at the more stripped down shrouded end of his discography and have arrived to giddy praise so what of unsurprisingly its more of the same despite the rich pads on the and theres a vacant lost feel throughout raw drum machines march around grey landscapes the pads are simply the fog that envelops theyre restrained but not especially slow like the from 8 all being at a laid back 120 or so bpm and ideal for early night sets the air of surrealism sets it apart from the usual easy listening style associated with this description the odd vocal clip on the 1 a female voice just beyond decipherability repeats throughout gives the track an unnerving alteration of presence and distance it and the deeper are underpinned by four-four whereas is more in charred dubstep territory along the lines of kangding rays pruitt-igoe last year think the start of an uncanny journey rather than a calm one

by the time mark lawrence traveled down to cuba for the recording sessions that would become 2012s in cuba dubstep had already mutated from its origins as a hermetic east london enclave to a world-conquering wobble lawrence was always one to find new angles on the sound be it with his own productions or through his dmz and deep medi musik labels and in cuba was no different but in having lawrence again go to the well getting his passport stamped for another part of the world theres an inherent risk of diminishing returns though not quite in machu picchu pits the dubstep producer against the native rhythms of peru unfortunately the album never completely melds in a manner that transcends each part pan pipes of twine around a timber-shaking thwack on the opener but no momentum builds pipes echo and wheeze like someone out of breath from hiking towards that incan citadel the track continually stopping and starting track never gets deep during its four minutes a trend that continues through most of when it does work the results show just how heady a mix of electronic and tribal traditions can be recalls the most thrilling peaks of cuba a bit of pipa triumphant horns and ambient street noise give the icy veneer of early dubstep a sweaty makeover as the name suggests the tricky percussion and attendant shouts give the track a boisterous strut one of the colorful highlights too often though the sonic elements just dont gel most of the tracks pass without catching the ear most evocative moment is the albums quietest a lone female voice singing the folk song with little more than a guitar and finger snaps as accompaniment its hard to say what adds to the song (aside from low-end) but its unadorned state is enough where in cuba boiled barely gets to a simmer
if you like your progressive house with an edge of trance then this origional mix is for you the track has a medium bass line with a fairly strong hi-hat kick layered over this are some pretty nice trancey sounding synths one thing that surprised me a little was it seemed to be lacking a big epic breakdown which i was expecting when track began while i will admit it is not really my style the origional euphoric style mix of s just didnt stand out enough inkfish have done 2 remix s of this track and both i feel are much stronger than the original remix 1 has a very nice bass line and a similar hi-hat kick to the original mix layered over the top is a robotic sounding beat that comes in on every fourth beat that starts around the 2-minute mark it has a much slower build-up than the original but would be a great track towards the end of a more progressive style set compared to the original mix this track has much more of a sense of building up and of going somewhere and has a nice dark floating breakdown the second inkfish remix (is my pick of the litter) and has a different bass line to the other remixs it is a sharper and crisper bass sound which has a great tribal sound about it it is no way as heavy as the first mix and has a nice breakdown like the other remix but rather than its dark floating style all the sounds are stripped right back to there basic minimal elements and to these elements a muffled vocal has been added the short sample is repeated but what is being said cannot be understood this is the slowest track of them and would be great track to build from overall its a nice piece of vinyl something that would be good in your collection and could be used on various occasions but have a listen to it and see for yourself as my style just that little bit more toward the progressive edge of things
its a classic dance music dilemma: when is an album not an album im not always sure myself does there have to be a concept behind everything in order to form a solid foundation and why does a collection of tracks so often fall afoul of the definition thats whats puzzling me listening to limacons debut i really cant make up my mind whether or not im listening to something more than a collection of grooves what is impressive on this collection is the production limacon has produced a very polished piece of work even if i find little to really engage with a common feel runs throughout the length of the album that of a thick and sticky bass embellished with machine squelches as synthetic-sounding as they come res merging minimalist and electro sensibilities topped off with a hefty nod to the sound of trentem ller four or five years ago everything is a little bit darker and driving and yet theres still that lack of spark and sound sinister enough to fulfill the needs of the likes of troy pierce or magda while the rest of the collection is steroids not that narcoleptically inclined overall though each track sounds both complex and simultaneously linear like a skyscraper built using tetris listening to this album im struck by how easy it would be to mix each tune seamlessly into the next give or take a few bumps along the way re are some very interesting touches and flourishes but they rarely combine to make something thats not relatively formulaic
its hard to know which is more useful to a producer of dance music control or grace but a sufficient store of both can make for a formidable combination indeed its rare too if you think about it especially to degree exhibited here by frenchman showcases meyer as a brisk technician (control) who also knows how and when to get out of his own way to let a track brea and reveal itself in time (grace) the a-side inventories a long list of ideas lots of little rhythmic ticks spastic-splash snares that come and go arpeggios articulated in different tones that circle to vertiginous effect but what could easily come off as an overly studious and dense form of electro disco unfurls with an impressive sense of ease which makes it ripe for both a warehouse unhinged in darkness or somewhere outside in sun its only till end is less striking but marked by a similar sense of movement as it cycles through variations on a more clomping and contemplative mood: steely and a little nervous but also spacious and chill a pair of remixes pherox on and raudive on speed material up to more bumptious and kinetic but less distinctive s nei r brea s and meyer shows so adeptly breath becomes m both

italians rio padice and massimo di lena each have considerable discographies the early sounds co-founders have collaborated before exploring robust but eccentric house and techno on eps for clone royal oak and moreaboutmusic but this the first of a pair of eps for under the name (its short for mephisto frequency oscillator) seems to mark a new phase in their union as statements of intent go its a very satisfying one across the two 12-inches a broad spectrum of house techno and double-proof disco is explored with playfulness and a taste for rough edges part 1 is probably the marginally better of the two mainly due to the presence of like many productions from these two its simple but a single element in this case a pensive piano loop is more than enough grist for the mill accentuating the mood is a silken vocal mostly clipped to a single note which at the midpoint briefly extends to reveal the phrase and longing the only thing keeping you from drifting into reverie is that sharp-clawed bassline elsewhere is the sort of loose-limbed house best enjoyed with an ice-cold cocktail the fact that it appears late in the summer doesnt make the way those chords tug languidly against the beat any less satisfying chunky tool meanwhile offers a more spartan conclusion padice and di lena are not quite so good at nasty as they are at nice but theyre more than adequately good at both
is dutch for magpie and the antwerp label has lived up to the name scratching intriguing baubles out of the loam of the experimental underground active since 2013 the label has worked with some names you might recognise tcf dmx krew ssaliva theres a chance you encountered ritmische bezinning by cofounder a suite of hyper fresh electronica and one of last years highlights but s curatorial skill is best showcased on their exo compilations which feature a host of names many of them unknown and present a sly fleet footed vision of ambient music the third in the series is the weightiest mostly thanks to guest spots from the parallel ambient crew around amsterdam labels music from memory and melody as truth and offer three soft focus compositions near the records end s is the highlight its hesitant opening leading to a gorgeous aquatic pay off all three tracks are good but their blissful moods and extended structures set them apart from the rest of the compilation to see what i mean take this three track run earlier in the comp s at a minute and change long is little more than a winsome twinkle of an idea it leads into s crystalline which is energetic but dissolves like a thin mist and then alo s r s 41 seconds of a child talking over cute scraps of glockenspiel all three tracks are short strange and smartly realised and all three names are unknown to discogs outside of this compilation (maybe theyre aliases of established producers ) most of the record unfolds in this fashion familiar producers make solid appearances formerly of planet mu offers gorgeous piano miniature and delivers on and ( s tracks like many here do experimental with fuzzy edges and a humble attitude a quality shares with other belgian labels like vlek and meakusma ) but your ears are just as likely to be caught by producers yet to make waves much beyond the antwerp underground like w with the sparkling arps of glassjes or the folksy fingerpicking of and or the strange jazzy takes on modern day exotica a sound which dominated exo2 and is represented here by (on the noirish ) and the latters starts off as ersatz miles davis all cool chord daubs and impressionistic flute then a field recording enters of some public event presumably the italian public holiday of the tracks title the shouts whistles and clapping gradually disturb the closed space of the music as if the two worlds are collapsing into one another its a curious gem on a compilation full of them
marvin uhde lives in bremen northwest germany where he goes to art school and does music stuff in his free time if his recent work is any indication he has plenty of it in addition to co-running a party called tip and the label drowned records uhde has been releasing various kinds of house tracks under the name since 2014 is his fourth record this year not counting the compilation appearances berlin label has culled three tunes from the producer that represent most of his musical range returns to the comb-filtered drum machine that helped make grey city nthem a raw psychedelic banger and takes that noisy jacking angle even further but the melodic streaks throughout its have more to do with the dreamy house heard on last years lessons in finding it would seem uhde can take on just about anything and whats more he does so without diluting his character sense of musicianship and experimental curiosity runs through these tracks whether its the light snappy synth loop and garbled grooves in or s percussive cacophony and air bubble atmosphere uhde seems bent on balancing the twisted with the approachable and then letting the potent combo take off only its could be said to play it straight but even that twinkling slow-burner eventually goes airborne
from spaced-out house to dubby electro to og dubstep its been a characteristically unpredictable year for the label ppleblim founded after he and shackleton brought skull disco to an end in 2008 while you might not be able to venture a guess at what the next pips side will sound like theres a good chance itll have some connection to lims home base of ristol the ohs is a characteristically inside job bringing fellow ristolians and futureboogie regulars ehling simpson into the fold release contains some of ed ayling and sam simpsons best moments yet under this guise (theyve made ravier twitchier stuff as aobinga i d ) stepping away from the r affectations of their futureboogie material the ohs finds the duo showing off their spacier side title cut maintains the slow chug legato bass and spacious drum programming but does away with much of the melody leaving us with an excellently woozy groove hits a little harder its growling slow-motion bassline pointing toward techno one should never attempt to pin down stylistically but the ohs suggests you shouldnt work ehling simpson into a corner either

in last night dj saved my life ill rewster suggests that discos commodification was helped by the arrival of electronically sequenced drums suddenly there was a simple formula for making disco nd much of this formula came from europe this formula comes to mind when listening to the first record from sadar en k chicagos sadar ahar and the dutch electro producer cosmic force ahar has a celebrated collection of soul and disco he also dabbles in disco edits with results that match his great dj sets ut theres something about that seems disconnected from his special finds sure its two tracks are funky and spirited with galloping rhythms born from live sax bass and a fiery guitar the electronic elements add oomph with sunny chords and massive drums that should get the dance floor rolling ut the result is more functional than memorable will add a flash of fun to summer parties but it wont have people clamouring for a track id
heads up a promoter and label in vancouver whose taste leans towards the minimal end of house hes also released eps for rontos my favorite robot a label that largely trades in tech house z avoids that genres zoned-out clich s by embellishing his tracks with his vocals or extra melodic elements sometimes it turns out hokey but it can also work out pretty well his strong new ep for is firmly in the latter camp the title track dangles its toes over the precipice of cheese for its entire ten-minute duration which works well for its grand intentions once its whining synth riff comes in you know youre in for a journey takes you higher and higher into the reaches of euphoria settling into a gorgeous extended breakdown that feels like sashas xpander in slow motion like the comedown after that outpouring of serotonin sides plods along with a grumbling bassline and the flattened drums and ghostly piano give it an antiquated sort of elegance a more by-the-numbers club track rounds off the ep and though its less intriguing than the other two its sultry smoulder is nice enough
25 years in you know where you are with they are not going to make a trap album go deep house or release a ball-crushing set of industrial techno yet as much as ed handley and andy turners music sticks to an idm/electronica blueprint its always taking subtly different forms the duo have for instance collaborated on audio-visual projects performed with a gamelan orchestra and done film soundtracks if their tenth album could be said to have a theme its the 1970s like their warp contemporaries plone and boards of canada that decades musical and cultural legacy has always been an influence in s work but rarely has it been so explicit this is an album steeped in the popular culture that will have surrounded turner and handly as children: folk music prog rock haunting animated childrens tv programmes and so on the resulting music is being richly melodic exquisite in its detail its easy to get very excited about at first but its a thrill that fades suffused with a wide-eyed utopian optimism the tracks from to are exceptionally pretty but they lack depth or tonal variety beautiful but also bland in contrast the opener a dense flurry of plucked strings and chimes is intense later in the shimmering synth-pop of luminaire and the relatively peppy darker techno of belatedly bursts into life finally delivering the sonic variety and emotional grist the album needs only to revert on to something inane and blissed-out if technically accomplished ultimately is a bravura performance that lacks bite
talian house producer is starting to come on strong is his fourth release since last year a pretty impressive clip and its a 12-inch made for big detailed systems the a-side tickles the headphone ear as well as the all-body one: the hi-hat sizzle has an intimacy that belies its obvious filtering and processing and when the chimes come up deep into the track theyre a little easter egg for the attentive listener as well as something to offset all that heavy thumping is a little more of an obvious throwback the subdued pads and piano are straight out of the early 90s classicist playbook and theres a quick pair of metallic synth notes that recur to situate the record further in that period but its pretty clearly of current vintage thanks to a seriously huge bassline that seems to stand astride the record more than giving the sense that its coming from within it
in a of is new territory for a belgian label whose stock in trade has been in a manner of speaking all over the shop s colourful catalogue is anchored in sample-based brain-twisting hip-hop though the lustrous electronic textures of a number of releases in particular from the likes of cupp cave have always promised broader horizons s debut 12-inch is the labels first foray into techno and its a fairly competent effort and of owe a debt to the slow-burn pulse of mark ernestus; the industrial static of the latter in particular is a serviceable basic channel impression is altogether less coy about its dance floor credentials but it too rides a rather reserved groove pacified by a synth that squirms and squelches over an otherwise insistent bassline its left to esc to assume the responsibility of peak time banger by way of its cavernous grand canyon-sized kicks though funnily enough the skeletal xylophone riff tempers that aspiration as well yes it may be one of the most straightforward releases have put out but its also one of their most enjoyable to date
it would be easy to forget that has only been producing for a couple of years on the other hand its no surprise someone who oversaw a label as important to house musics development as nrk has already pretty much honed a fully-formed sound continuing where the first two releases on his own left off the redux ep is pure house music: not neo-detroit stuff not studiously self-indulgent stuff just straight up house for sweaty dance floors is as epic as any theme tune should be a pounding kick and itchy shakers set the tone before things slowly grow in stature with the arrival of some well-swung wooden hits and distant melodic daubs theres a hint of swelling grandeur when a soft melodic phrase rises up through the mix but its jim morrisons spoken word vocal (culled from the doors song which gives the label its name) that really sets things alight skips and kicks with a more tribalistic density but buried little organ riffs and a soaring diva vocal keep things thoroughly airy and loveable if you dont love the latter part however fret not: also included is a voiceless version that allows you to revel in the deft synth work and constantly shapeshifting analogue bassline which was previously obscured
its not surprising that previously turned up on throwing snows left_ lank label the righton-based producer shares the oblique rhythms and lush textures of left_ lank labelmates visionist vessel and el kid and here he launches effortlessly into the full-blown emotional sweep that characterizes throwing snows recent output cant is a sweet tune an anthem of sorts but an unassuming one made of rolling acoustic drums rich organs and wistful little vocal fillips its clearly modeled after joy orbisons hyph mngo but it doesnt sound much like its peers in that mini-genre for one thing it actually nails the whole fist-clenching breast-beating tear-down-the-sky tension and release thing which most of joy os followers can only gesture at on top of that the sound design follows its own schema sure the sampled female vocals are a trope heard in 90 of bass and uk house music these days but he makes them work subtly elongating the phrase as the track reaches its climax on the flip keeps things more low key it shares the palette of cant but its energies turn inward resulting in a shuffling brooding take on 130 pm a fine warm-up tune that stews in its own juices without merely treading water
when lv made routes with mc joshua idehen back in 2011 it felt universal slinky grooves mashed uk sensibilities with african rhythms and idehens half-rapped half-spoken ruminations on london could have been applied to any sprawling metropolis but then the group turned their attention towards south africa with sebenza which made their collaboration with idehen seem like a simple dalliance so it was a surprise but a welcome one when they dropped out of nowhere early this year sharpened to a razors edge saw everyone involved turn more venomous than ever idehens lyrics no longer concern the rhythms of city living but rather the inequality and strife it breeds boy that boy that idiot/ thinks hes grimy thinks hes brilliant/ he dont know his time is limited/ cant see his end is imminent he snarls hanging on the last word and jackhammering it out again as if some new meaning might surface from the repetition probably the toughest track on their latest album isnt representative of the moodier but its shift in subject matter certainly is idehen sounds disconnected from the sprawl around him this time his perspective pointed inward rather than outward as a result his influence is occasionally muted like hes pausing for thought on hes almost overtaken by the weepy synths around him and on the fantastically fidgety double decker hes more of a spectral presence his occasional absence allows the production duo behind him to flourish double decker is a near masterpiece racing forward smoothly with a few well-timed bumps in the road like a coach riding through the night when idehen does speak he commands attention loud not properly he intones on album opener and that seems to be his motto for the brasher half of twisting words and phrases with giddy aplomb best moments of the verbally dense for example come from his wordless onomatopoeia re are quieter tracks too where his voice nears a whisper you make the hardest of me go soft/ i need to cool off/ i cant calm down when you look at me so he says with unnerving focus over a palpitating organ on obsession adding boil the water with the miso way he cuts through the drama with the mundanities of everyday life is as affecting as a frank ohara poem; it feels as if were sitting in idehens apartment with him on he speaks about depression with the honesty of someone who has experienced it firsthand finding a new universality in intimately personal themes most heartbreaking moment comes with the closing track a crushing tale of failing relationships and affairs so delicate it feels as if it might disintegrate on contact lv are able to soundtrack such moments of intense introspection with pitch-perfect backing tracks only proves their own growth and versatility even as they sacrifice some of the more anthemic qualities of their earlier work but its a worthy trade-off: might not have the far-reaching social insights of routes but it shows that idehens personal world is almost as gripping

your record is from detroit that means you get an extra ten seconds of listening dont waste their time so said anthony shake shakir to o parrish when he received a test pressing of the first sound signature record ts an interesting point and one that seems particularly relevant when discussing little is known about the man except that he supposedly hails from the d and even thats up for debate musically there is certainly something about groves well-swung house and garage that has a smoky sense of us soul to it but the truth is there is nothing groundbreaking about his music what he does he does well but without the 313 association he might be lost in the shuffle to date groves output has come mostly through a parisian deep house label run by hardrock striker after which this album is named over the course of a handful of eps and a past lp in 01 ( 313 4 ever ) his sound hasnt varied much one things for sure though: grove can program a drum machine that speaks directly to your booty and most of the time he has a knack for picking samples that ignite even the simplest of tracks after an authentic enough opening interlude of languid live drums and wilting sun-kissed melodies launches in earnest with a muggy mid-tempo house kicker that sets a nice tone from there its all variations on a theme is a breezy and trumpet-led affair doubles its scuffed and scruffy kicks s electric melody gets skewed and twisted through myriad filters se tracks have an unaffected charm that may not land them in any year-end lists but drop them at the right point in a dj set and theyre guaranteed to fill a dance floor
s mo may be balearic leaning ambience and chillout but mark barrott and his crew know how to cut a rug too both of the tracks on this split 12 inch were first released three years ago in very limited quantities and created a bit of kerfuffle barrott obviously feels there s been the requisite cooling off period to sate collectors and completists by reissuing them in a single package gentlemens is barrott himself is far removed from the pillowy downtempo and drum bass he fashioned in his future loop foundation days with its breathy do it again vocal sample and breakdown of pure mah n cheese its silly but we know barrott can do earnest and cool too aficionados of late 80s house will have their interest piqued by the title of s youre juddering bassline pattern from turntable orchestras east coast house behemoth from 19 remains now embellished by heavily reverbed italo keys and stuttering vocals apparently a riot ensued among japanese house fans eager to get their hands on one of 30 copies back in 2011 who knew kitchen sink nu disco was big in yokohama yd destroy the city if they discovered the simple devastating charms of the original
the fifth release on italian breaks label comes in the form of two remixes of dirty waltzer by the first by santos and the other remix by madox the santos another planet reprise is on the a-side and it showcases the breaks side of house producer santos the beats are quite paced in this remix accompanied by a deep humming baseline and some screeching effects the track maintains a pretty steady flow for the first half while the 2nd half of the track sis a little more intense with an increase in effects and vocal samples the final product is a pretty dancefloor intense remix by santos the madox remix on the flip increases the pace ever so slightly but keeps the deep baselines in the production the intense sound effects from the original remain making this another peak time remix 2 pretty upbeat remixes of with the only complaint being that they are 2 quite similar remixes nevertheless they are both quite solid and very club friendly productions
the ever impressive return back to action with a nice little ep here featuring the talents of ebon vs evan marcus after a fantastic debut year for the label that saw the likes of pole folder halogen and paul lancaster grace the label cpr are keen to keep the ball rolling especially with the e ep first up is the original tribal mix of ebon sleepless2 many of you will remember this chunky piece of work from the james zabiela sound in motion mix and it easy to see why james chose this production to feature in his mix from the outset a nice deep baseline has the track moving while intricate tribal percussion rolls delightfully throughout african vocal samples combine with a seductive female echo giving the track a nice eerie feel as well on the flip is fallen by evan marcus another very solid production this track by evan is quite minimal while at the same time it is quite a strong record with its crisp tribal drum patterns nice eerie sounds and effects help build the production towards the main breakdown which sees nice smooth synths surround an array of quirky sounds and effects a very nice ep by cpr which really showcases the darker and dirtier aspects of their label compared to say earlier releases such as on a bridge either way it is clear to see that there isn t a shortage of talent at the cp headquarters
it s summer time and we all need a little bit of sex happiness and perhaps even the odd piano in our lives right about now for a certain subset of londoners heading off for the beaches of ayia napa in this dose of all the good things in life will be coming from the new and misleadingly named genre (alternative names include just plain funky or even wonky fact fans ) the genre emerged in reaction to the seriousness and drabness of the grime and dubstep scenes and pulls in influences as varied as broken beat soca african music and us house it s a sound that s so new that it s barely possible to buy aside from things like supa d s rinse fm mix cd dj ng s tell me and this one: crazi cousinz mix of last year s bassline hit the crazi cousinz mix has a warm thick sound but its also full of teenage hormones and end-of-the-week euphoria there s nothing terribly classy about the double-snare soca rhythms or the canned bongos but thats a good thing: theres a genuine sense of excitement around this new idea of what house should sound like it feels like music for small rooms full of dedicated dancers where the air is alive with desire and kinetic motion crazi cousinz are quite rightly shooting to local stardom in london with productions like this one they have an instinctive grasp of body rhythms and (perhaps just as importantly) are great fun an element that seems to be missing from much of the supposed underground these days once you listen to the bassline mix by rekless and the uncredited club mix youll begin to realize just how far crazi cousinz took this track the source material is unremarkable bassline with stiff beats and wobbly bass and neither mix does much to transform it whats most interesting though is how sexless the vocals sound when compared with the funky mix control ss mix is mc-driven 2step reminiscent of the days of so solid crew and as such has a refreshing rawness and energy to it a shame then that its probably too dated-sounding for most people to want to play but all of the rest doesnt matter much crazi cousinz mix is a great introduction to a new sound and a great summer anthem on its own terms snap up now and say you were there at the beginning
is probably an unfamiliar name to most he has however a long pedigree in dance music most notably collaborating extensively with timo maas not that you need to know this of course because this release comes out on one of the iconic techno labels and one owned by remixer of the year carl craig fittingly this is pure class from start to finish every detail is lovingly crafted from weighty but carefully judged kicks to hi-hats that enter at exactly the right moment the a-side full clip is likely to get the most play with its distinctive one-bar detroit riff subtly evolving and mutating (using all sorts of studio wizardry) the result is texture and depth created from very simple musical elements in classic techno style as the acidic bassline rises up halfway through it feels like you could dance to it forever and when the drums drop back in after the achingly intense breakdown even the most minimal of scarves will be swinging the b-side programmer is actually my personal favourite of the two because it builds so beautifully it never approaches the intensity of full clip but instead gradually ramps up the tension moving from eerie echoing female vocals to snappy hats to a slow crescendo of metallic pads it feels like riding a wooden cart down an abandoned mineshaft with sonic details glinting like gems in the tunnel walls my fantasy club is the kind of place that goes wild to tracks like this i ll stop myself now because this release contains such depth that i could really could write about it for pages the one negative that could be leveled at it is that it does feel overly reverential of classic motor city techno the whole thing however is executed so beautifully that it feels churlish to criticize it for such a contextual issue nobody will worry about such things when it plays on a loud system

remember the old line djs used to trot out about taking you on a journey and providing history lessons thats usually not the point but when a jock that knows her stuff and gets lucky in the licensing department decides to trace some crucial steps i find it hard to resist take last years fabriclive 36 in which james murphy and pat mahoney of lcd soundsystem redrew disco as a music of hard hitting minimalism using only the breakdown of instant funks ive got my mind made up : borderline sacrilege absolute genius this is the territory poplife sucks claims with the focus shifted forward to 1981 84 which means you get a compilation that melds s super obvious into the s super obvious its the best segue of the year as shrewd in its way as dolly parton gt; royksopp on 2002s heard on radio soulwax pt 2 difference is that 2 many djs were showing off their mixing skills; the and olivier tjon of the belgian club night poplife (and the entrepreneur credited with editing ) simply lay their best stuff end to end poplife sucks tunes are overlapped slightly not dj ed resulting in the kinds of transitions whose occasional abruptness pulls you in rather than kills the mood entrepreneurs edits are audible if youre familiar with some of whats here already: jumps to the guitar solo right in the middle of morris day announcing hey jesse n now jerome jerome doesnt appear borderline sacrilege but the absolute genius is the way its positioned in the mix right before the own cover of olivia newton johns a record so ridiculously trashy it wore my guard down within two plays but that may just be because its between and ninos del you never know with these things eclectic dj mixes often feel show offy but the and tjons selections are mind bogglingly sneaky and generous i didnt know i needed to hear re in anyones mix again but lo and behold; ditto ; hell ive never been much of a fan and positively slays here nd when they do show off its worthy of a crate digger holy shit ward: s sounds like a hip hop prototype with samba horns the heaviest footed drums imaginable and gnarled wool guitar scrawling away somewhere in the background pparently a video of this 1973 gem has been bouncing around on youtube start there you will not be sorry
first time i listened to b o a t s i had to double-check it was made by the same that appeared on hot creations n i checked again and again even now im not convinced italian duos ghoulish its you again might have been one of the more individual releases to come from the foss/jones-instigated pandemic of 2011 and 12 but it wasnt in any way a signifier of what was to come: b o a t s in all its dark and dubby dreamscape glory is a totally different proposition from a totally different place save for one collaborative ep on dumb unit weve heard nothing from the italian duo since their debut album more than makes up for that its so focussed and fully formed youd be surprised if francesco leali and federico maccherone had left their studio at all in the last year from rumbling dub to post-apocalyptic ambiance dark pop to rampaging techno b o a t s freely explores the parameters of a full-length in ways that recall trentemollers 2006 opus last resort often bleak but never hostile ride would be a fine soundtrack in the right club but it also makes for a powerful experience in headphones is both cavernous and intimate not least because of its clean and laid-bare vocals much of the album is muffled or veiled as if coming through a wall or up through the ground best exemplifies this with fierce and buried kicks that sound like a distant subterranean pulse whether youre drifting like flotsam in the percussion on drowning under the grainy dub chords of or coming down with the innocent lullaby melodies of (featuring ) you always feel cocooned in a pillow-y womb of sound b o a t s were told stands for based on a true story come the end that satisfying feeling of having just experienced something of having been somewhere is very real indeed
how far f the grid can you stretch techno and still call it techno thats the question bristolian producer has been gradually working towards since he emerged last year seb gainsboroughs productions haunted and permanently skewed have descended into an abyss consumed by post-punk and noise flourishes on his debut album gainsborough presents an entire world rendered in black and dull chrome much like actress r i p on first impression is an intermittently dazzling array fragments that dont quite piece together but also like r i p when you listen carefully the albums faint and barely-there heartbeat begins to emerge is a sewer trawl through the repressed neuroses techno whats left after the drug-fueled vestiges the party have left an exploration the sinister undertones collectives like sandwell district unleashed and unfettered also illuminates an unsurprising preoccupation with dub music a twisted-metal take on the genre that brings to mind modern primitivists like ekoplekz we get harsh meditations like underpinned by wheezing machines or the fascinating which detonates an augustus pablo-calibre bassline into digital detritus another logical allegiance gainsboroughs is the kind dark ambient and modern classical he showcased on his ra podcast manifesting here in a sensibility where noise meets sweetly wafting melodies harsher moments like the screechy are buoyed by soaring motifs: imagine a scuffed-up alva noto out for blood the result is music that unsettles and unnerves starts out with a ghostly whomp but is soon swallowed by a beautiful string section it always feels like theres two or three things going on at once with melody lines whizzing by in a blur thats part what makes so simultaneously confusing and exhilarating: at first the seemingly clumsy craftsmanship can seem sloppy but its a mark labour rather than laziness its a bustling record that always holds new moments to reveal for all the talk how difficult it is s two highlights are its most straightforward theyre made all the more powerful for their relative positions as pillars solidity in an album that wallows in its own dissolution building a delirious amble element by element becomes a veritable orchestra found sound and grizzled synth that erupts into a fantastic symphony chewed up sound by its final two minutes doing it one better constructs an industrial-lite doorcrasher that dissolves into a sepulchral rapture both these tracks arent really techno per se and neither is the rest the album yet its one the most engaging and gripping techno albums the year anyway
must have been pretty pleased when he landed this split release with after all a certain strand of the berlin producers output proudly displays the influence of detroit electro (think of the steely futurism of fishbone ) and his dj sets make frequent sorties into drexciyan territory even beyond this line of influence however the two tracks on work wonderfully together each is an electro epic unafraid to make grand gestures with the form and each is masterfully executed primed to induce chills of either dread or euphoria on the dance floor s leans towards the former its skeletal beat serving as little more than a vehicle for icy cascades of synthetic strings and voices each time that grandiose chord progression wheels back around its thicker and more intoxicating as with the best sci-fi dystopias there is something oddly seductive to the horror s is only fractionally lighter in outlook his best-received tracks often indulge his playful side (the distended bass wobbles of cactus or agnes demise s juddering midpoint meltdown) here although the tempo has been ratcheted up to 150 bpm the vibe is fairly reserved granted there are moments of overload the licks of steroidal funk bass; the sweeping chords that periodically bum-rush the mix but mostly we remain in stasis anchored by a single forlorn bass figure the devil is in the micro-detail glimmering atmospherics miniature hi-hat fusillades moments of glitched confusion all of it as ever handled with a finesse that borders on the virtuosic should donald decide to retire any time soon he can rest assured that the future of electro is in safe hands
if like me you re very much into rolling tranced out electronic music rather than traditional house and techno proper a studiously deep house label like z rich s drumpoet would seem like an unlikely place to find a fix such are the pitfalls of single-mindedness taste i guess ut fans of the hypnotic stuff should check this ep out: not so much for the deetron remix which is fair-to-middling chord techno aimed squarely at detroit heads but for the modest but effective crowdpleaser remix on the like marc houle s orrowed gear from 2004 a track which it resembles and would mix well into this cut is unusual because of the stinginess of its bassline which is made of precisely one single note and draws the line at one note per kick it s a trick which lends the track an uncommon uptightness: no funk no boogie just krautrockian repetition and an appealing sense of expectancy nd like orrowed gear it s a structure that allows the music to be all about the tweaks this time of the bass note itself: sometimes shorter sometimes longer sometimes so loud it oozes out of the music and onto the floor it doesn t hurt that thomas rinkmann has done a bang-up job mastering this remix either like the dubsteppers say there s a pressure to it ll this underneath a top end of chicken scratch guitars and long violin bows that will appeal to dial fans and the like as well as melodies that are catchy enough to be memorable but not too catchy as to be annoying ut that bass is where the real beauty is if you re single-minded enough to get pleasure from a producer tweaking one bass note this is the record for you
as a dj i want people to dance but i also want them to be a little bit unsure of whats going on most of the time jkerian morgan told lisa blanning in an ra feature earlier this year this is instructive of how the berlin producer approaches dance music along with the rest of the janus affiliates whose party series seeks to break free from the constraints of complacent club culture last year morgan was behind the first release on januss label with the astonishing damsel in distress a 30-minute mixtape of face-melting electronics and ghostly acapellas that not-so-neatly outlined what janus was about he then followed it with the excellent heterocetera ep for tri angle where he channeled his impulses into confrontational dance music that mashed up ballroom jersey club and grime now morgan returns to janus for another 30 minutes of gnashing teeth and grinding metal on and he sounds nastier and angrier than before that part is intentional: morgan said the mixtape was inspired by his recent touring experiences particularly the european festival circuit where he was disillusioned by the straightness and whiteness of it all he also felt a growing disconnect from club culture itself but instead of finding an avenue back to it stubbornly cuts its own path as far from dance music as possible its destruction rather than deconstruction where morgan seizes on the violent capabilities of electronic sound he ruthlessly pulls apart samples and stretches voices beyond human capability the mix weaves between abrasive and quiet with little regard for functionality and there are almost no hooks to grab onto unless you count the jagged edges of morgans beats (if they can be called that) theres no beyonc vocal wafting through the mix here only the promise of more destruction around every corner a few lulls like an instrumental version of his remix of teengirl fantasy are temporary shelters between morgans mortar rounds but even those moments tend to end abruptly he tries his best to disrupt conventions of how dance mixes should flow which makes a difficult listen it was meant to be the worst 25 minutes of your life morgan told ra of damsel in distress surprised at the positive reaction to it takes a step closer to completing that mission though to his credit (and maybe to his chagrin) theres still something deeply enjoyable about morgans visceral and unforgiving club music subversions

s is commonly referred to as an acid-house classic these days but its taken a long time to achieve the prominence that tag suggests first released on a trax white label in it somehow failed to make the cut for bills 1995 compilation lp finally turning up (incorrectly credited to mateo murphy) on a 2005 comp from the short-lived aciiieeed label now this long-awaited reissue gathers together and reworks from ricardo and invade boss ilario libumi the original version is a brilliantly simple blend of squelching 303 tumbling drums chimes and vocals recalling bygone eras both remixes are fairly low-key on the pick of the two threads suppressed tendrils of the vocal around delicate acid notes and the murmuring shuffle of half-awake drums libubis robotic slow-build has its charms but has a hard time holding its own against the original version and s remix
ed eeley is one of the most important figures in drum bass though much of his influence is behind the scenes his shogun label is a respected institution thats stridently underground but not afraid to flirt with the genres stadium ready contingent as a producer his tracks are on the big room side and he knows how to j festival style working in crowd pleasers alongside more challenging moments his fabriclive mix fits this mold and also captures the ethos of the london clubs friday nights: raucous and clever all at once opening with and swerving through heavy hitters from and all in the first ten tracks hurtles right into the fray without much in the way of build up through barrages of spiky drums eeleys technical skills quickly become apparent though he mixes as fast and hard as any other drum bass j he has an unusually smooth way of blending tracks the mix is structured as a series of pummeling passages interspersed with more pop friendly highlights like als ream the refrains of these tracks tend to linger creating accessible anchoring points between more functional moments never afraid to take a left turn eeley stops dead for s annies an orchestral halftime stepper that ignites into the slamming s p y remix of the same track halfway through this triggers s even more aggressive second half a tour de force through drum basss sleek and deadly side with plenty of selections from standout producers and (highlighted by some rhythmic cartwheels on the latters excellent ) it burns itself out with a red hot double header from misanthrop and noisia for other js ending with hard edged techstep like this could be seen as a concession to the lowest common denominator something genre purists wouldnt touch but that juxtaposition has always been part of s genius the same impulse that drives his jing and one that makes so deep and dynamic

ts usually sebo k who churns out s annual yuletide anthem but this year the honours go to the labels first lady herself and what an anthem it is is a classy and infectious track that surely would have made it into plenty of discerning crates and hard drives over the festive period urgently built over a rollicking bass riff and a grizzly blues-sounding vocal sample seems to climax endlessly in a blend of swagger swathes of melodic charm and effective percussive fills is essentially a remix of the title track described on the press release as a female interpretation its surprising to hear it come out heavier and darker losing its sexiness and giddy headspace in favour of rugged bass injections and jazzy rhodes licks dont initially continues the slide into darker territories dropping the tempo a little and overlapping whispered vocals to suggest the paranoia of coming down however light touches of funk bass and innocent melodies swirl a sense of optimism out of the confusion to round off a solid single
last solo album by black noise was a lush expanse of hendrik webers gorgeous minimal techno it was all but a contemporary classic when it arrived in 2010 though it had one flaw: the panda bear-featuring stick to my side webers rich and rhythmic soundscape didnt work with a pop-leaning singer who didnt complement the music so much as cramp its style weber refines his approach to vocals on the title track of his new ep and the lead single from upcoming album triad dial-affiliated artist scott mou aka laces his voice through the majestic ambiance twinkling chimes and thick textured beat his wispy falsetto mixed just low enough to be both discernible and unobtrusive effect it has on webers production however is ultimately superficial like a puff of glitter punctuating a magicians reveal as with stick to my side the instrumentation and sound design of might have soared without the vocal two lengthy minimal tracks fill out the rest of at nearly 11 minutes relies too heavily on webers meandering jam session with and ir wonky fx and punch drunk low-end make for a heady groove at first but the energy plateaus after a midpoint breakdown and fails to find its stride again on the other hand does a better job with pace gradually working itself into a whorl of funky bass notes and snappy drum machines but theres a catch: weber himself hops on the mic seven minutes in and his flat baritone muddies the otherwise pristine mix thankfully a wash of angelic harmony soon drowns him out once again placing the focus solely on the blissful music
shl mo is shaun baron-carvais the fastest rising producer on taapion records parisian techno crew havent been around long but have easily established themselves as consistent purveyors of cold and celestial club cuts production-wise what differentiates shl mo from his collaborators is subtle: balancing feel and function he has a finer sense of lifting techno tracks from mere emotion to something more epic this makes shl mo a good fit kick off s new tome series its name (by definition: a large book) suggests something ancient and unearthed and everything about plays this up effectively ep doesnt have much variety but each tracks gentle play between soft atmosphere and submerged beats sets a stark mood res a cathedral-like grandness to its idyllic choral harmonies creating a pristine high ceiling above the stammering kicks is less atmospheric and more hard-pressed techno while treads between the textures of the first two its hard tumble is slowly swept into a dark mist shot through with distant chords heady ripples and moments of light on the dutch duo combine those two tracks to create something more austere but the spaciousness of the rest of this record is what makes it enticing
the new alias of the london-based producer liam wachs is nominally a continuation of his last project desert sound colony but musically theyre worlds apart originally a solo venture that evolved into a live trio desert sound colony made slow poppy house in the ob moses mould ( y supported the canadian duo on tour in 2015 ) on the other hand is energetic club music a bass-heavy blend of deep house techno and breaks with a melodic flourish 002 the second release on wachs dance floor-focussed label pulls together two lively cuts in this style wachs used to make dubstep and you can hear the sounds influence in s sparse and moody intro he says though that the tracks main inspiration was a nicolas lutz warm-up set at fabric in 2015 this comes through in the dynamic breakbeats and heavy low-end while a persistent three-note synth line slowly turns up the intensity it all comes to a head with only 90 seconds to go when after a 32-bar breakdown some neat filter trickery sends the synths lassoing round the kicks ive never heard a drop like it which suggests itll send dance floors wild a collaboration with the little-known producer is more of a roller with live percussion and a snaking hum contributing to a nice earthy swing ut if that makes it sound like yet another slice of summery house then think again random bursts of spiralling squeals give it a freaky edge
these days it seems like everyone in england cant help but to want to try out a new tempo after dropping a drum bass album on exit last year s first record for bristols lies somewhere near gates classic techno characterised by a rushing sense minimalism could easily be a robert hood creation its built around just one simple dangerously-throbbing motif but feels like much more than that s rolling filtered drums and wraith-like atmospherics playing tricks on ears that fers similar thrills packaging m up into more benign form ra r than throb its grubby hook bounces cheerfully from side-to-side and its pads are warm and breezy not ominous is all kinds niggly; type track which wriggles its way fur r and fur r under skin with successive listens here s use quiet is effective trembling synths sinking downwards just so y can be pushed right back up by lumbering bass surprisingly its records eponymous cut which is its weakest the stripped simplicity its clattering drums and nasty reese-like bass echo quality found elsewhere on ep but s vocal sampling is far from judicious in latter half track ill shit sample is trotted out so many times it becomes hard to concentrate on anything else this is however a one- f event on 12-inch sans bells and whistles o rwise feels focussed and powerful
following from disc one toyshop feat anita kelsey return with million miles this time with a david sun remix and the jamieson and hamel dub included in this 2nd instalment of this summer release the david sun mix starts off quite smoothly with some nice subtle strings and some scattered beats but the honeymoon is soon over as the track quickly gets into gear with some chunk beat patterns throbbing bass tones and melodic rings and swirls the vocal doesn t make as big an appearance as it does in the first disc but it is scattered here and there in this mix nevertheless this is a pretty chunky progressive interpretation and quite interesting throughout on the flip is the jameison hamel dub in essence it s the vocal stripped version of the mix that was included in disc one and sunkissed obviously feel that these great producers demand two mixes and they are probably right the track is very strong in itself without the vocals with the nice melodic patterns running free on their own as well as the deep baselines and string patterns there is a hint of the vocal albeit heavily effected and looped in parts and quite subtle which all add to the strength of the production all in all it s another pretty solid disc with the b-side yet again shining and the a-side providing the toughest mix of the lot well worth a look
might at first glance seem a frivolous name for an act but with a bit of background it makes a good description of the pairs music its a combination of their nicknames for each other: dean muhsin the more technically inclined who perhaps has more to do with the (often dubby) synth programming and louisa page an ex-dancer with a correspondingly well-developed sense of rhythm two features are fairly distinct in their music but balance nicely an perfect example being their pug face ep on steve lawlers viva music from earlier this year things continues in this vein containing three very smooth liquid slices of dub house that are in a utilitarian way varied in their energy levels and complemented by brendon moeller who is sensibly drafted in under his echologist guise to provide a remix all these grown-up sounding adjectives might give the impression that things is overly mature but while its true that it seeks to work well within current envelopes rather than push them theres enough individuality here to give the tracks flair and panache floats along with a phased pad hovering in the background little blue vocal snippets and a shaker giving motion (all very alka-seltzer) but the snare for example is clattery as if the drummer forgot to take the wooden cover off coming down to earth with a more defined and weighty drum track filled in with an aqueous suspension of chords to changes the rhythm/synth balance giving more prominence to the former this time its a choice which sacrifices subtlety but in its place is usablility this cut being the most likely here to suit the energy level of most clubs in contrast the is the most subdued with a tasty soup of bass and sub bass bubbling beneath an effervescent limbo major chords shift into the minor and a tight groovy rhythm is made by exactingly placed woodblock plinks moellers remix shows his talent for making syncopated funk from folds of dubby textures a bustling throng of human voices perhaps recorded at a train station or another transport hub chatters away underneath as drags chops and pops permeate and upturn the sediment
information on remains thin on the ground even after just getting started his lauded debut for livity sound sub-label dnuos ytivil have provided all of one sentence of information about this release but as with just getting started one listen is all it takes to get thoroughly excited about this artist all three tracks deftly walk the line between broken abrasion and glinting prettiness with opener resting primarily on sharp high notes that threaten to tumble over on themselves far-off industrial grinds and submerged bass wax and wane in the mix creating something thats half club-ready and half sound-art on the flip and wouldnt are both almost meditative the former particularly so bubbles away gently with the odd echoing bleep coursing through drums that sound like boats nudging together quietly at a dock in the dead of night wouldnt is more skittish though its brittle flashing qualities are leavened by gently whistling pads and and a softened undercurrent of bass
for a l g time s music didnt stray far from lab mostly c fined to his own family of labels his strain of york house was able to develop and mutate since 2013 it has spread virus-like across atlantic breaking out labels like trilogy tapes killekill and nord is spiders first album since this minor epidemic got underway and it reflects ways in which his music has changed during that time not much as it turns out but thats no bad thing spiders world is a grim place filled with prophecies of societal collapse res a track here called whose sampled jazz chords jangle uneasily against a charcoal backdrop over top a sampled m ologue tells of a mans simmering rage: its just a questi of when is this going to erupt and up who is it going to erupt spider cuts in similar voices throughout album and sometimes his proselytising feels a bit heavy-handed he appears to subscribe to kind of ultra-paranoid c spiracy ories found in darker corners of internet and tracks like resistance it can feel like music is taking a back seat to his doomsday proclamati s more sparingly applied elsewhere se mes suit spiders style nicely his music is an apocalyptic visi of york house its sensuous chords soot-smudged and half buried in debris its swung groove reduced to an uneasy twitch being by now an expert with form spider takes it in a variety of directi s tempos range from sultry trudge of opener to insectoid scuttle of phoenix mood while always dark can take soulful shades ( sterious on ) or even bleaker es ( which sounds like a more decrepit marco shuttle) most of se tracks are as rich and absorbing as anything spider has made even so his ra r limited toolkit can become tiring over course of an hour and a few moments of beatless noise are a welcome diversi catastrophic lifts album out of its slightly lacklustre opening and dumps it into excellent closing track - sounds like wind howling across an empty landscape as if spiders nightmare predicti s have come true and re are no humans left
as s maiden outing on the open-eared it should come as little surprise that is about as left-of-centre the german producer has ventured in some time a hazy warm-up number gets the release underway thick with swirling atmospherics and a rhythm that steadily builds for what ultimately becomes a healthy albeit somewhat restricted tool follows and sees the twirling chords brunn utilized on its predecessor return again working with a continual progression in intensity while guest vocalist s speech matches its growing pace and further asserting brunns obvious adeptness at tension and release its not until you flip the record over that brunn offers up anything remotely close to peak-time territory the title track is a lesson in bastardised harmony stacking on layer after layer of thick synth effects atop an uptempo drum pattern before abruptly coming to a close however its the packages closer that stands as the highlight brunns talent has consistently shone through whenever its put to slower tempos and that trend continues here the textures he pulls so expertly from his small array of hardware are finally given sufficient breathing space and the difference is remarkable whether its the warm and chugging bassline oscillating highs or modest percussion that djs latch onto expect this one to do some (subtle) damage

as producers who enjoy collaboration adrian sherwood and rob elliss chemistry is easily explained sherwood has made music alongside artists as diverse as depeche mode lee scratch perry and beastie boys elliss work with others has for the most part involved the dubstep nebula including loefah shackleton and mumdance as well as inhabiting similar sound worlds they have a mutual respect for each others music their first record together 2015s late night endless seemed inevitable while that album showed sherwood and elliss respective merits it fell short on delivering something truly synergetic if late night endless was the sound of the pair sounding comfortable their latest full-length vs attempts to upset the balance it does so with mixed results theres pinchs swamp 81 hit which is given a digi-dub overhaul in the opening bars luscious and detailed it morphs into an astringent and industrious broken techno romp this one plays to sherwood and elliss strengths and its one of the albums highlights the dubious dubstep fix of ryuichi sakamotos is not the pianos on tracks like and the handiwork of primal screams martin duffy lift vs out of the duos comfort zone is built around a soaring rush of percussion powered by cymbals and drums is a more textural composition full of unusual sound sources in each case duffys melodies offer something that positioned at a distance from the other elements enhances those tracks sherwood pinch are a highly compatible team but on occasion their individual qualities shine through this is particularly noticeable on the albums two vocal tracks: the uplifting featuring lee scratch perry is very sherwood and the taz-assisted dread bass of feels like a pinch track hearing producers as accomplished as ellis or sherwood steal the spotlight from time to time makes vs all the more appealing
mos ferry is an important imprint in these times often labeled minimal but far from a label that adheres to formulas they offer a wonky angular take on whats happening in the scene ferry has turned up the heat lately especially with a string of strong peak time-ready releases from hidenobu ito mossa and marcel knopf a theme that dutchman follows with his big room banger is a straight forward driving groove with a tough solid sub bass over which abrasive ragga vocals ride with the infectious titular phrase i dont think this is a tune to ponder if you imagine the big-bearded long-locked engineer deep in concentration painstakingly tweaking and twiddling intricate textures this is the bit of that set where he exhales looks up at his audience jumps around and pumps his fist expect it to be spun at lots of very big mental parties by the likes of jesse rose or switch but dont count on it staying in the box long on the remix dave finds a different route slowing the tempo and cutting up the groove dave utilises the vocals and introduces some keys carrying a touch of melancholy he creates an alternative that sits somewhere between the dancehall and the lounge which is a nice contrast to the original on the flipside dons heavy touches of glitch pops clicks over a warm thumping bass its a chugger but chugs by uncomfortably the spacious atmospherics here seem an ill fit and although there are several changes in direction throughout it lacks charm and loses its appeal fairly quickly this record is all about the yipyip
past year has been quite a whirlwind for after putting her name on the map with love in me in the early part of 2011 she has quickly progressed from relatively unknown dj/producer to a respected member of the house music community releasing tracks on visionquest crosstown rebels and her friend s imprint meanwhile she also recently secured her self professed dream booking a slot at this years opening party for circoloco at dc 10 a club where she got her electronic music education during multiple trips to ibiza in the mid 00s hell if tabloid stories are to be believed shes even got the royal seal of approval her debut mix cd for s new mix series presents has arrived at the perfect time giving a chance to showcase the skills that led to her circoloco recruitment the course of 75 minutes carefully threads together a selection of tracks on presents that carry her penchant for the melancholy airy side of electronic music after a rather ethereal start punctuated by s things really start warming up when and sam s remix of own (commissioned exclusively for the gives way to s brooding atmosphere of the track coupled with its haunting vocals provides a peak after which point the pace and energy stays at a reasonable high what follows is a selection of music that although varied bears plenty of similarities and flows as a single composition s is placed over the top of and s with deft subtlety while later ryan s remix of cmon by merges seamlessly with s self titled track y the close strides toward her storys natural conclusion the tribal percussion of unds ultra ng giving way to s soundtrack esque epic s a fitting finale that summarises the mix perfectly; dramatic lush and crafted with a similarly seasoned air of polish
in the liner notes for includes a dedication to conlon nancarrow but he really didnt need to the influence of the pioneering 20th century composer whose most famous works were performed on automated player piano because they were too complex for humans is clear throughout the albums 18 tracks repetitive piano chords bang away as if on a mechanized assembly line following a process described as translating the timbre of a grande piano into binary codes thus rebuilding its corpus with 0 and 1s the result might be the harshest record in brinkmanns discography isnt exactly noisy but theres a relentless brutality to all the pounding piano many tracks slam away for lengthy stretches as if brinkmann designed them as endurance tests (or even torture techniques) in many of his projects hes seemed interested in removing human elements from his music the cold robotic aura of fits that mission sometimes crossing the line from inhuman to inhumane as ruthless as it can be the music is a fascinating demonstration of what repetition can do when left unattended as if the creator has exited the room there are some interesting variations in brinkmanns attack but many are so small they feel like illusions conjured by all the numbing monotony on (each track is named after an international airport code) brinkmanns rolling chords crest with free-jazz abandon on a blindingly fast piano spawns rumbling overtones like a steve reich piece played in a hall of mirrors parts of deviate from brinkmanns dominant mode leaning more toward the atmospheric and are brief electronic sketches that bubble playfully and is like a drone created by an algorithm but many of his non-piano pieces are aggressive and provoking particularly the closer an incessant series of demolition blasts the piece is exhausting but its a fitting way to close such an unyielding record
is an artist best enjoyed patiently over the duration of an album more house bound project of hamburgs peter kersten (whose other activities include friskier dance floor fare as sten abstract hip hop as lloyd and slow core guitar ambiance as bordeaux) productions are characterised by lazy tempos spacious rhythms bright bell like tones and a keen sense of (minor keyed) melody fitting neatly into the catalogues of kompakt and dial on albums absence of blight and night will last forever kersten wore his indie miserablism on his sleeve with successive tracks falling like raindrops on a misty windshield: subtle variants on the same monochromatic model res little variation in either pace mood or basic components used but wallowing in these grey shadings is joyously indulgent his latest release is collection of singles b sides and remixes and what it suffers from in less cohesive programming it compensates with in quality his mix of s is worth admission alone: dark grey pads lifted straight from the twin peaks theme growl down low while rattled handfuls of chipped china provide the top end res also a pogoing up down bassline sparse functional drums and a melody of fractured rave keys all seductively moody and gloriously assembled receives similar treatment moving from gloomy atmosphere into pseudo acid bounce where each element is made to seem entirely necessary his mix of s microgoth anthem makes the concept more elusive than ever losing the urgency in favour of a nihilistic hopelessness conjured from dying tape loops off kilter chimes and weeping dub tones with tracks like and kompakt have returned the favour their mournful funk fittingly showing up on mixes by michael mayer and tobias thomas but even theyd be reluctant to feature the adolescent whine of s left far too intact to excite the is itself hardly a highlight feeling spare to the point of blandness while left me confused but these reservations are few and petty and this collection like the whole back catalogue can be highly recommended
of flat beat fame makes a welcome return to the stable with a two tracker of the usual oizo standards first up is and needless to say its an intense piece of electro funk for lack of any other better description the beats are minimal but the electro synths and electro patterns that roll are quite forceful an addictive production that works quite well at normal speed or pitched down quite a bit this is another quality piece of electronic music from mr oizo 1 44 follows and it is quite a down tempo piece of music big stabbing synths attack alongside some smooth beat patterns as well some very quirky interludes late on in the track very weird interesting from mr oizo and that is perhaps why this release stands out like it does needless to say that it is a pretty good release with providing the highlight
this is defecteds third foray in the house and concentrates on the up and coming talents of belgiums junior jack and kid creme for me its the best in the series so far with some uplifting vocal anthems instrumental trickery and good humour along the way throughout theres never the feeling of a formula being adhered to always a good thing kicking off with the soulful late at night track cd1 moves through euphoric us house from soulsearcher some funky bass from tune 500 and the massive dj gregory tropical soundclash chicken lips funky 80s throwback he not in gets remix treatment from mutiny and is superbly mixed into mike dunns familiar anthem god made me phunky a moment that reminds me how much more creative some djs could be at mixing john ciafones everyday is a bit tooo much information on the nipple front (you have to listen ) and the mix closes with more from dj gregory cd2 contains much more of the duos production work so we get the excellent remix of thick ds insatiable an inspired pairing of maphia ltds chasing with dajae in full acappella effect and roland clarkes ideal world powers that be taking him to planet rock kid creme tackles shakedowns at night to close some rich belgian delicacies on offer here then but my advice is dont eat them all at once
last month the increasingly prolific appeared on an rash ep for jef ks silver network showcasing a twisted jersey garage sound with his remix on its and by a released to mark ir londons tenth anniversary peak has pulled on his tough boots to stride purposefully across two stomping big room tracks its bumps along in frantic fashion its penetrating bass peppered by dub-soaked metallic toms and fire alarm synths the trippy washes that mark out the early moments of by a roll in like gentle breakers but peak doesnt dwell on it for long quickly working in some voodoo ray -style acid patterns that change the mood visionquests ultrasone turn out whats nearly a blank sheet reinterpretation of its ; a clattering conga loop moves over its eight minutes washed in a synth drone and pitted with sonar blip percussion the belgian duos fine remix leaves rgys version which doesnt sound terribly different from the original choking in its vapour trail

s productions fuse an organic ethnic vibe with synthesized electronic manipulations built upon a dubstep inspired blueprint the latest 12 inch on his imprint features two upbeat numbers that elegantly weave together bass beats and melody s long engagement with electronica is apparent in the subtle electronic tinkering that detail the songs hiccupping and stuttering beats twittering tics and swirling synths among them the amusingly titled is set off by skippy but rolling staccato synth stabs that are soon replaced with a growling but restrained bassline and a light but solid backbeat this rhythm and bass combo underpins echoing synth sweeps and reverberating rhythms that airily and effortlessly blend together is in similar territory: the beat is a garage meets techno stomper limber but strong driving and soothing at the same time with piano licks dancing melodically around synth bleeps and squeaks the beauty here is in the arrangement: each twist and turn of the tunes offers new combinations and versions of their respective building blocks making the progression fresh but familiar paradoxically though these switch ups while keeping things fresh also deprive the tunes of the grabbing memorability that would have made this good release great
for album appreciators fixated of late on the tough-metal bind of ostgut/berghain it seems hard to remember that just two years ago was turning out kaleidoscopic stunners and was a big part of it coupled with axel willners debut album as the field the sao paolo natives debut on the cologne label chromophobia was arguably the years biggest techno crossover record a thirteen-tracker of vibrant emotionality and narrative coloring that seemed a gift for album lovers and long-form listeners chromophobia offered a breadth of sound that felt neither too far-reaching nor too shallow shifting from the swaying green-eyed trance of mala strana to the loose-hipped minimalism of the title track or the blessing where willner wanted you submerged dunked in his stately symphonic bristling as a kind of hypnotic alternative reality soothing and almost placid boratto needed your senses at day-speed to appreciate all the colors of his palette he wanted you here both ears open almost as a storyteller would to appreciate his smooth sonic weaving one of simple stubby rhythms and charming synthetic cadences of course borattos aint been slack since then beside a wealth of remixes to his credit on labels like boxer and systematic he released the underrated single the island with martin eyerer and placed highlights on compilations by both cocoon and the latter anunciaci n was classic boratto a serene buzz of layered synths and sinewy euphoric tones his follow up full-length plays like a natural successor to last year s anunciaci n exemplifying borattos fascination with playing subtle cross-grain tensions against the rosiest-cheeked of melodies the records foray into the pop-nuggetry of beautiful life makes more out of its staid formula than you hear at first progressing from a retread of that tracks overt summer evening rush to reveal itself as less showy with its tenderness less gaudily sentimental if just as engaging lead single toys with the most abstract picasso-shifted senses of tune with its bubbly sanded-down synths and peppery rhythms while the effervescent pulses of slowly wear away at its stark pulpy beat til they gain a hold meanwhile perfects borattos taste for field-day meandering another of his tiny hummable epics that doesnt waste syllables or sounds but whereas much of chromophobia s sway lay in how adeptly boratto melded his talent for song with sly frictions between his rhythms and oft buried melodies sometimes is too contented with gaudy surface appeal lacks mala strana s shy first-love ascent and winds up sounding like its dull coffeehouse remix while bungles the narrative arc necessary to keep its lite electronica afloat more perplexing though is final track which as an interlude of solemn piano and gurgles of electronic finishing stinks of the self-aware ambient album closer and yet in chastising boratto for some of these flaws i cant help but feel a bit like the dickhead who lampoons his friend for being too welcoming too open and friendly in a techno landscape often cold and crass anything like the sincerity boratto has to offer should be met fireside a hot cup on hand
platipus records have a long and distinguished history having being stalwarts of the trance scene for well over a decade this release sees platipus headman simon berry- with another sumptuous offering also featuring natacha atlas of trans-global underground notoriety on vocals the original mix is first off the plate bringing together an typically driving blend of peaktime beats along with a rich tapestry of warm organic synthlines and twinkling percussion the mood is uplifting from the off notching it up a level as atlass orgasmic mystical vocals are added along with scintillating acid line which eases off before notching back up again on the flip side is some russian spice with the vorontsov remix displaying an exciting angle to the package he takes parts of the original and softens the energy levels down with an tighter mix of incessant percussion and housier beats enhancing the mystical quality of the vocals with added stings and beckoning melodic aftertraces aot platipus are making a charismatic start to 06 with a definite floorshaker reminiscent of early releases
i should probably declare from the start that im suffering from what might be called ed anger fatigue the french invasion night last may which was pretty much the first time the ed anger crew played together in the uk was amazing ut now like a 35 year old clubber gobbling mdma i m left hunting around hopelessly trying to recapture that first high im not saying that by ed anger boss is the death knell for the label because their stuff still rocks but having heard their sound for a while now im left asking: what more have you got the title track on the e very very slow smacked out electro house a la rekid is a case in point sure the drop is enormous and the layers of chunky mechanical noises sound thrillingly like a gearbox accidentally thrown into reverse but it s remarkably similar to sebastians 2005 e smoking kills and to be blunt it s just not as good on the other hand is miami bass wearing an electronic jacket the problem is it takes itself a bit too seriously whereas tracks by dj assault and dj godfather (not to mention onde do role) have a silliness about them that keeps you dancing lus theyre funkier my question what more have you got only begins to be answered in track three s remix of whats again by a modish arisian garage rock trio its very clever very mind gnawing and very good takes tiny vocal and instrumental cuts from the original and inserts them over a pounding chopped up techno thud like a little tease the last few bars of the song play along teasingly out with the original track that hes been messing around with which makes you realise what hes been up to a very nice touch the ed anger sound has been a real hit because it sounds so primeval and wild at best it sounded like the stooges doing dance music this e is cool but captures both the bad and the good points of where this label is at
hanovers gets his first full release on the main label following two previous offerings on the speicher imprint no stranger to anyone with an ear for club music his earlier tracks have received support from coxy and timo mass amongst others light in the dark opens with a dark intro of sombre riffs and one gets the feeling that this could be a gritty affair this intuition is partially confirmed as the synth-riff escalates and a plodding kickdrum almost progressive in nature gets things rolling still theres plenty of momentum to keep us interested this one has a minimal lo-fi turn-the-lights-out feel and has some villalobos influences in the form of aquatic drum-taps and plodding mid-range beats to the fore redlight is just a notch up from the previous track in terms of tempo and straight away the bassline gets to work building a groove again a slight progressive feel here but theres techno grit in the form of edgy noises buzzing static sounds and offsets in the tone of the bassline keep us moving before another sombre riff is used minute barely audible jangly keys add another twist to this piece but this is a track which keeps the listener waiting patiently in the hope of something else happening another builder but in my opinion seems to do it better than the opening effort finally we reach what is my favourite piece of this minimal puzzle with shining just feel that dark speaker-freaker vibe and you might agree with me bartsch means business on this one and in no time the track establishes itself with a great bit of nasty bass/synth action more layers are added with gurgling synths and generally bubbly electronic meanderings this is indeed the pick of the crop and one for those who like to use dark stroboscopic vibes to add an edge to proceedings a great mood-altering little number which i will be keeping close at hand when i play out so quite a good offering from on a release which is in every sense of the word minimal in parts it still gives us an adequate exploration of tone and will appeal to fans of techno and electro alike good to see showing some form again on its main label following a few shrewd releases in recent times
title is not the proud mark of a brash young artist but rather a dignified signal of maturity: it refers to renowned producer s years in dance music its also his debut album but youd never know it from the cool surety of the whole thing intalex is probably best known for heading the family of labels where he pushes a graceful and quietly experimental drum bass sound helping to launch the production career of dutch hybridizer martyn and providing temporary lodgings for producers like klute nu:tone and icicle if you arent familiar with the veterans own productions you can get an idea of what they sound like from that list: uncluttered hummable tunes polished to a solid finish (after years you tend to learn a lot about production value) is defined by its buffed textures and surprisingly soft palette: intalexs synth work is luscious drums perfectly placed and the velvety smooth sloping basslines prop up the tracks rather than tear through them its fascinating to hear him explore synth-heavy territory close to utonomic on the crystalline or make sense of an assortment of strange noises on an inspired take on stray-style minimal drum bass by way of ctress tortured frequencies album features a wealth of collaborations adding to its charming homemade patchwork feel brazilian producer s p y provides the album with its most driving moments on opener and dub s mournful basslines and gentle pads are all over and garage royalty provides the aforementioned with a little bit of its strange swing intalex moves beyond just drum bass on cooking up a workmanlike take on 303-infused dubstep with and a speedy house workout in but they fit so perfectly that the obvious tempo changes almost go unnoticed when he sticks to more familiar tempos the results reflect as lachie gordon observed recently the penchant for this sort of drum bass to pop its camo-clad head through the mire of pop music re are a few moments on that are for lack of a better term pop songs and the product is not only convincing but persuasive: s turn on is given all the space it needs s vocal on way is backed by a legitimately sentimental instrumental and intalex even attempts a cover version of radioheads while the latter is an audacious and risky move the fact that it somehow isnt utterly garbage says something for intalexs understated prowess might not be a breathless tour de force but its rarely ever less than good and drum bass can always use a bit of reassuring stability
is the third record from liss c on his own lc series label which launched at the beginning of the year the valencia-born berlin-based producer specializes in acidic strains of techno and the titles of his tracks here give you a good idea of what to expect with little more than a thick buzzing 303 line atop no-frills 4/4 percussion is best used as a layering tool its a decent effort but it s missing that extra element (or sense of depth) that would make it stand out in the mix on the other hand goes bonkers with prickly distorted acid riffs and machine-gun drums a quirky but potentially effective dance floor assault two remixers handle the other side of the record sleeparchive reduces s modulated buzzing to a low throb making room for his trademark tangents and bleeps from a few deep-space beacons (too few if anything) the s take on tones down much of the originals peak-time aggression it makes for a more spacious and accessible remix but theres still a hard edge with blurry far-away echoes balanced up front by growling chords and hi-hats overall its a solid four-tracker with just enough range to keep things interesting
you can never have enough norwegians called terje making dance music can you rather than cosmic disco this terje makes house with a techno underbelly (rather than the other way around) dubby lead track is built around skeletal percussion and tough synth stabs its the sort of record hipp-e and halo would have made if they had transplanted to europe at the height of their career and at ten minutes plus its a great comfort break tune for the dj whose helped himself to too much of the promoters champagne first of the klartraum remixes decorates it with a snappy percussive tech groove and purring bassline is a more strident bouncy affair albeit with an emotive piano breakdown although with that extra urgency is lost some of the atmosphere that hangs above re are hints of breakbeat in the 4/4 spacey tech-disco assault of with its balearic piano-style middle-eighth klartaum then take a warm fuzzy deep house segment of the original and wrap it in a cotton wool blanket of techno that ebbs and swells like the tide but its that original that elbows its way to the front of your consciousness of an ep of rich promise

this time last year the recorded output of japanese percussionist and composer midori takada was hard to find save for a peculiar youtube autoplay function that pushed takadas exquisite (and expensive) 1983 masterpiece through the looking glass in such a way that it was played 1 6 million times those videos have since been taken down but the album was reissued earlier this year by palto flats and we release whatever the fuck we want the latter label has now reissued takadas 1990 follow-up a collaboration with the renowned japanese pianist and jazz composer masahiko satoh satoh has had a long recording career with albums that date back to the late 60s hes made music alongside free jazz players like steve lacy and peter br tzmann as well as gary peacock and toots thielemans released seven years after through the looking glass straddles the line between satohs versatile playing and takadas meticulous percussion the cd reissue opens with which is sleek and strange at first pass wonky digital bass courtesy of haruomi hosono and squalling synth lines mark takadas steadfast percussion her fills more grand than anything on through the looking glass hosono also contributes to a queasy ambient piece of disembodied voices rubbed wineglass drones and takadas small percussive accents takadas more measured gamelan-like timbres can be found on the second track entwining with satohs more overt melodies hews even closer to the template established on through the looking glass with gongs resonating in negative space and marimba lines bringing to mind sunlight rippling on a rivers surface the latter instrument also surfaces on d which resembles a pitched-up steve reichs six marimbas shows how well the two artists combined with satohs sparkling melodies out in front the albums longest composition showcases takadas dynamic playing builds for two minutes with little more than the sound of struck metal a tom roll slowly emerging underneath it the middle section of the piece finds takada toggling between many different rhythmic patterns a showstopping display of her drumming talent satoh is a good foil for takada pushing her rhythms into prog synth pop and new age realms on he helps bring out another side of takadas sound

is in its delicious way a bit of a head-wrecker its most hectic its like being subjected to one of beat icon neal cassadys speed-addled monologues when it gets dreamy its like coming round on a beach in ibiza your brain a frazzled fractal if that makes it sound like hard work it isnt its rich with melody plus for anyone who lived through birth rise and brilliantly messy demise of minimal techno much of this collaboration between s ryan crosson and cadenzas cesare merveille will bring on a proustian rush of nostalgia specifically this fidgety fizzing nexus of jazz world music and techno influences harks back to that period circa 2007 when minimal had transformed itself from music of grid-mapped pulses into a cavalier charge against prescribed rhythmic tonal and melodic logic like an improvisational jazz trio warming up opening salvos of sound like a band setting scene finding ir groove featuring pianists and is lovely (think: nicolas jaar channelling keith jarrett) with its splashy kick bustling bass and regular plays s trumpet resampled into swarms of brass ups tempo but it is following run of five tracks where se components coalesce into something special fans of dense exotic polyrhythmic percussion will love and rhythmically y sound like marching insect armies if former all whispered and/or frenetic bursts of be-bop sax and keys is an enigmatic mood piece last years lead single is a striking display of snaking dance floor insidiousness and aching melancholy reverb drenched xylophone melodies that tumble through it almost aimlessly are morbidly haunting featuring s husky doleful voice takes this jazz-tronica interplay in a different direction its bleak atmosphere akin to knife all glittering showers of bells is deceptive a functional tool seemingly purpose built for open-air summer parties which like an engine seizing-up suddenly backfires and busts apart its sharp descent into heavily-treated afrobeat territory ups funk exponentially with its dislocated drums revolving hang chimes and curiously bursts of compressed shaft-esque funk guitar is a kind of ambient balm after all that potential head-scratching albeit one that is itself concocted from strange ingredients but thats for you a timely reminder that in house and techno re is much more to life than simply straight 4/4

are a bit hit and miss for me thats not so much a criticism as a comment on their modus operandi: releases are scattered in different directions stylistically this one reaches back and brings up classics from two acid techno and rave characters from the 90s being a proponent of the early ustralian scene and with his successful sides series is well formed and simple: two lines repeat the same note with a weird beeping adding a dissonant tone that youre not quite sure you can hear its the kind of basic loopy rave that non dance music enthusiasts might look at you in a funny way for listening to but its straightforwardness is really more of a distillation sounds less like the archetype of what was around at that time its hurrying analogue and galloping drum splashes are overlaid by a lucent pad for a short while a delicate moment of peace before we start running in circles again the repetitive analogue riff is great with a mysterious journeying quality that keeps us in inexorable tow
the label returns to the 10-inch format after a recent 12-inch release from ike release and hot city with two of label boss s numerically christened tracks still tweaking the somewhat unconventional garage-meets-techno template this ep sees really crank the low end flipping the impact away from the delayed chords of his previous work and pouring his energy into a torrent of sine waves summarises this best jerking into life with an industrial charm clunking and lasering through an opening loop before the long drawn out bass chords hit warming the mix to beyond toasty toying again with the notion of mutation takes a chord thats almost identical to that used on his previous release but he layers it slightly leaving it in the distance allowing a fresh wave of synths to cascade over the top snatching at a memorable female vocal here and there its the combination of the chimes and punchy 2-step drum work that gives more of a dance floor edge when it builds and drops into the 4x4 drum pattern with the ascending bass note at the end of each bar it sounds completely transformed from its opening segment its a measure of s talent and technique that all it takes is a simple backing off the kick drum and a slight shuffling for him to slip effortlessly back to a 2-step groove

it might be a bit presumptuous naming your label critical but over almost ten years and over fifty releases mowlavis label seems to be fulfilling its self made prophesy label has blazed an idiosyncratic path through drum bass one more orthodox than say autonomic but just as potent and effective critical has released quite a few compilations of upfront material in the past but its latest is in part a retrospective affair chronologically going from 2003 to and painting an enviable picture in the process while the label has never really had its own distinct roster the makeshift family mowlavi has built up over the years is nothing if not impressive; from to to to it reads like a whos who of drum bass kicking off with bona fide classics in the junglist ivory tickling of s and s stomach churning the compilations first half powers through at blistering speeds but even at its heaviest on critical sound the label rarely resorts to cheap techstep tactics or aggro violence and the closest it comes s dizzy frantic ) still feels miles above the din of contemporaries has steered the label more and more toward the minimal and melodically focused side of things and the compilations midsection betrays an inspiring present and future for the imprint a four song stretch beginning with s where the aerodynamic beat sounds like its ripping through the spacetime continuum traverses a significant amount of outside influence and approach showing that its not just autonomic bringing new sounds into the genre s steals the compilation taking the formula of intricate breaks and delicate melodies adds one of s most stately vocals to date and emerges with an instant classic in the process frenetic tabla of s of cun and s subaquatic halfstep in both exclusive new tracks show that rich textures are just as much of a concern as breakneck beats and tugging basslines curiously the compilations back end sees the label hurtling right back down the techstep wormhole but once again its done with care: s is brooding and angry but expressed with utmost clarity while s gridlocked is wrapped in sumptuous strings and synths s to the proves theres life left yet in loud tunneling racket course if its presumptuous to name your label critical its downright arrogant to call your compilation the critical sound of drum bass but with such a near perfect balance of refined orthodoxy and open minded experimentalism whos going to argue
fair few people have taken issue with namely for the titles of his work his midwestern-sourced style and his moniker but its wrong to dismiss the berlin-based brit as a wanton appropriator born mark hawkins the producer ran close to the wire when he called his 2012 ep cabrini green naming it after the notorious housing project in chicago but his debut album for makes similar references in an appropriately personal manner suggests that the influence of public housing still looms large for hawkins deed he grew up on a council estate in london and now lives on one in berlin s hes said in interviews hes thankful for the government support and reckons that without it he wouldnt be able to make music nd thats where the issues all but disappear no doubt the sound is beholden to vintage us house music not to mention uk labels like classic and diy discs but hes so adept in the field that its hard not to get on board hawkins is among the most consistent producers of jacking dance floor jams in the last five years follows the trend and is stuffed with dj weapons re are however a couple of awkward tracks disco frenzy of is a wild and loopy affair that might work well mid-set but is jarring as an album opener gets bogged down by its nagging grubby bassline nearly every other track features a key ingredient that elevates the music whether its a slamming kick a slinky hi-hat or the sort of bristling energy that makes classic house so hard to accurately replicate builds to the raved up peak of im where hawkins chops s vocals into pained stabs rather than simply slapping her soulful croon over the beat mood then retreats to the subdued groove of before ramping things back up with the dance mania-esque hustle of ty and the gliding acid funk of on tims and pple us artist adds some gorgeous smeared chords and breezy keys from the bubbly cuts to the tender moments to the artwork from underground resistance affiliate dj t-1000 feels nothing short of authentic and fun

debut for dial marks its first release from an merican and its a decidedly housier turn for a label that has so far built its identity around a first-class roster of mostly-minimal artists like lawrence efdemin and pantha du prince it seems like this could be an index of larger style shifts at play: if critics like the guardian s tony naylor are to be believed deep house marks one of subgenres poised for resurgence in light of a supposed broad creative fatigue affecting minimal in roberts case the house factor bursts onto the scene about a minute into the eps eponymous opener: he spends the intro speaking the stripped techno dialect of his dial compatriots before diving into deep house waters using slivers of melody and sampled soul to great effect over a spare midtempo groove the most remarkable aspect of this track however will be missed unless you give it repeated headphone attention: its actually a micrological wonder with a deep background populated with numerous ghostly repetitions of foregrounded noises it almost sounds like a vinyl palimpsest like the songs been pressed on top of some forgotten previous incarnation which nevertheless continues to flutter and bounce submerged underneath theres a nicely cohesive rhythmic progression across the three tracks a kind of gentle descent like a fair-weather plane landing it begins with the relatively straightforward house shake of lowers gears on the even-sparer s and bottoms out in the final which teeters on that ultimate limit point for woozy grooves where a wobble too far and youre on your ass on the dance floor by and large the reward in roberts tracks lies in the details take for example the hand clap which is the nose on technos face: its that organ that sticks right out and meets you two inches before the body does and as a result its contours are of great consequence (you cant hide a lousy clap anymore than you can mask a cyrano schnozz ) the production on this ep would look stunning on roberts cv should he think of going into rhinoplasty s standard electronic claps on the 2 and 4 beat are nicely echoed by acoustic ones that lend the track a breezy subtle organicity the clap on is a compressed sharp-tipped beaut that snaps with rubber-band thwack like an ear-flick from a grade-school hooligan its great counterpoint to the cascades of tinkling piano tumbling across the beats with the sort of ornate flourish youd associate with a morricone soundtrack lastly is some good-natured lounge wonk that sounds like its been de-tuned flush with goofy inebriated ardor with descending organ chord-stabs and some highly drunken jazz piano clunk that can barely stand up straight if youre supposed to sweat him it sounds like youre doing it alone in the cab home after a few too many

in the last few years a spate of emerging talent have been championing the current trend of classic-but-current house music in righton crosstown favourite russ yallop being a prime example new label looks set to continue the trend kicks off his ep for the imprint with the superb starting off a lot darker than it ends up cade begins by painting a bleakly futuristic landscape of squawking robotic raptors and militaristic drums the mood lightens considerably with the addition of chopped and echoed vocal stabs and cades drum programming keeps you on your toes throughout (you never know when the next kick is going to land ) cades former collaborator ethyl delivers a sparse dreamy reimagining with infrequent bass warbles billowing like dark clouds in an otherwise clear vista of washed out pads and wispy vocals lush in other words but not without a strong sense of purpose emphasised by the endlessly repeating vocal snippet brutally clipped from the original wrapping things up heads deep under the salty earth muted and claustrophobic until the exultantly shimmering organ temporarily relieves the thick veil of cloying bass throbs in the break
calum lees funky swagger has never fit into any niche which puts his latest move in perspective his new label is meant to represent the next stage in his life after graduating from university its appropriate that he launches with one of his most idiosyncratic tracks t only 116 pm its slower than anything else like it roken bass-heavy and swinging like a wrecking ball it has the oomph of dubstep but at a much slower pace his drum programming is brilliant though his craftsmanship is undercut by a chattering vocal sample a hook shoehorned into a tune that didnt need one things get wonkier on the flipside s drums thunder and ricochet in a chasm of reverb aided by all kinds of weird fx somewhere between a dub record and rashad eckers music its engaging and unpredictable and it points the way forward for a producer who is starting to show what hes really capable of

antonio launched last year with his breeze ep it was backed by a rust-bucket remix from his lo-fi techno compadre innsyter of la club ource fame from its frankfurt base the label has since put out tapes from crusty dark wave producers like dj loser and violet poison the black and white photocopied aesthetic of its artwork (by the madrid crew unlocked youth ) hints at the sort of music at hand tape five in the series comes via sweden and anders karlssons cantankerous celld d project karlsson arrived at electronic music via punk earlier in the year he teamed up with varg for an ambient techno record on opal tapes which was noisy but dreamy celld d courts a more specific sound: coarse ebm-indebted and full of punk electronics its a coarsely ebm-indebted affair punk electronics through and through is the grooviest of the four tracks if you can keep up with its piston pace is sludgier with a midnight allure while shoots pointed bleeps like bullets theyre all more inventive with the ebm template than which follows the rules more closely with vocal snatches and industrial murk file alongside your weird-but-makes-sense collection of mannequin and kess kill records
can do one thing well and she seems determined to beat it to death before moving on her second release away from her usual home at hyperdub could easily be a leftover from debut lp contact love want have its playful fun catchy ultimately enjoyable but theres a nagging feeling that is on autopilot languishing in an exhausted template that was decidedly quite limited to begin with listen carefully however and youll notice her sphere has widened; s atmospherics are pried open and the iridescent riffs are given full room to shine: strings actually sounding like strings et al its this new sense of atmosphere that saves the ep as its other two tracks find much inspiration in their free-range settings again utilizing familiar sounds is far more lifelike and realistic than were used to from slapback drums and off-key piano resounding in a fantastically large echo chamber as those familiar melodies waft in now soaked in luxurious echo rather than vacuum-sealed dry its the eps brave step into unfamiliar territory that proves its most promising; shouldnt recycles the riff of and buries it alive throwing ominous strings and haunting vocals on top of the dirt heap in almost mocking fashion its a darkness not usually explored in s permanent-daylight (or at least neon-lit) world its most affecting dimension might not even be readily apparent: human vocal sounds in an track are not a common occurrence though judging from the results maybe its something she should try more often
producer aka yannick thuet and peers like jared wilson john heckle and the late andreas gehm are the big wave surfers of dance music y chase the elusive perfect acid line the gnarlier the better thuet throws the basement tales party at the i-boat club in bordeaux djs on intergalactic fm and crafts a grotty brand of acid that combines classic chi-town sounds with nasty new beat and ebm influences he has found a suitable home for this thorny approach at broken dreams the no-nonsense sub-label that has been a home for raw records by gijs poortman (as gstring) alessandro adriani and black merlin on tracks like ut looks back to unhinged windy city productions like james jack rabbit martins only wanted to be where thuets deadpan vocals match the simmering menace of its demented lovers plea uts cruel casual delivery works perfectly when paired with blown-out acid his utterances take on a pained frantic tenor as the record progresses he howls like a boneyard ghoul on while its clattering 707 toms and minor-key synths create a queasy jacking equilibrium on he completes his transition into werewolf as he growls over menacing arpeggios thuet like helena hauff trades in the ominous sounds and squat party principles laid out by hague legends such as guy tavares and i-f as lo-fi dance music burgeons in popularity is a reminder that for some producers rawness isnt a fashion statement its a way of life
renowned for being the dj and producer for la underground hip hop group jurassic 5 cut chemist is also known for his turntablist techniques intelligent production and crafty beatsmanship before releasing music with jurassic 5 he was doing his own thing on the la turntablist scene and managed to concoct a live turntablist session with dj shortkut at the future primitive in the late 90s today he still known for his turntablist skills with underground releases like brainfreeze and product placement with dj shadow - both a mish mash of old skool 70s funk hip hop story telling records and tv commercials now cut chemist does it on his own for where he takes the tunes hes known for producing (a majority of them being j5 tracks) and cuts and scratches them up as only cut chemist knows how while the tracklisting isnt revealed at all on the album jurassic 5 fans would easily recognise the tunes including the flute line from their 97 classic jayou contact from their groundbreaking debut album quality control (and in my opinion their best so far) gets remixed and rescratched here with the contact sample replaced with react its quite easy to make out what j5 tunes get used if not recognisable by the beat he even includes snippets of the mcs vocals in there too which takes away all the guess work - no points awarded for guessing that nelly furtado sings in the thin line either the hip hop beats turn into uptempo swing time when cut drops in swingset which then leads into snt which cut had produced alongside multitalented guitarist bassplayer cellist miles tacket and had originally appeared on the funky precedent vol 1 - a hip hop album which was released to keep music in los angeles unified school district schools its not all j5 and cut chemist though cut even does a live turntablist remix of ugly ducklings eye on the gold chain - as if the original and remixes werent awesome enough cut chemist had put his take on ugly ducklings tribute to the rope that the einstein wears all in all is a wicked mash up of cut chemists own productions its definitely missing a few gems in my opinion including the hard to find unified rebelution (jurassic 5s first track after they joined forces from unity committee and the rebels of rhythm) and what is a cut chemist suite without the classic party hip hop track cut chemist suite by ozomatli turntablist fans will love the skills on this album and jurassic 5 fans will love it how he all melds it together (i for one am in awe of his skills) but for those whove heard it all before may want to hunt down the brainfreeze and product placement mixes he did with dj shadow
is a big deal for ustralian producer its his first solo p since 2008 and its also his debut proper for the esteemed label ispatch the record is heavy on collaborations (seemingly his preferred mode of working) but the attention is firmly on and he doesnt disappoint offering a more nuanced take on barreling techstep his appeal lies in pure polished perfection with just enough melody to make it stick nothing here deviates from that familiar formula but its done so well that its exciting anyways the title track is a spacious tune with a healthy helping of reverb opens up the usually aggressive sound with a wide soundstage and his free floating basslines ripping through the ether he collaborates with rs on a hi tech stepper that lets off little sound effects as it zooms on by he then teams up with for which is more compact but flush with big dramatic chords ticking the requisite drum bass producer does dubstep box might actually be the best track on the p with a livelier swing than minimal youngsta style dubstep the growling basslines are almost sexy as they push against the thrusting backdrop

the wallop family welcome into the fold the production duo of korean mutabor who have had previous outings on such labels as oven ready and invent here we see them hook up with moscow nightclub dancer tess who provides the vocals of the original mix is a clutch of rumbling dark basslines and pin pricking percussion that keep a constant flow while lusty vocals take control of our senses with orgasmic results the mood is kept low down throughout with use of subtle jacking tribal rhythms underneath the almost pounding bass maintaining the deep atmosphere as tess gets ever more sexual the main track is a nick hook remix the house supremo whips up a take thats got a more monotonous groove letting the vocals do the work and paying more attention to smoothening out the house appeal maintaining the eerie mood
s career has not been one of twists and turns so much as a relentless march on a singular path as a founding (and now sole) member of industrial innovators cabaret voltaire hes been at the forefront of electronic music since the 70s kirks solo career has been equally noteworthy from his take on bleep techno in the 80s to his exploration of ambient electronica and world music as sandoz (his discogs page lists 41 other aliases ) his recent output often self-released digital-only has struggled to make the same impact which is perhaps symptomatic of the increasingly crowded market in which diy-inclined artists like him operate but recent retrospectives of his work as and sandoz on mute records have helped highlight his extensive influence on electronic music s sound visceral and dense has a palpable sense of urgency the sharp arpeggio that opens up builds via squalling guitars and distorted vocal chants into a billowing sonic overload but kirk often circumvents dark music tropes s melody for example is conspicuously chirpy these breezy refrains when placed in kirks music contend with blasts of static off-key synth stabs and heavily dubbed-out speech channeling the spirit of yorks no wave scene couldve come from liquid liquid had they invested in some synths tracks like and have accents of contemporary club music but is strongest when it draws from older material the jittery drums of resemble a martin hannett production providing the perfect rig for kirk s beyond-the-grave vocal intonations and fuzz-spewing leads delivered with more control than the early experimental days of cabaret voltaire yet still brimming with vitality the album is a fine reminder of kirks strengths
remix albums are almost reliably spotty affairs dogged ei r by inconsistency or a lack of any real structure a slog through a slurry of disparate reworks but in context of an album like kevin martins 2009 waiting for a stunning record of low-frequency fever dreams immersed in spirit of dub it almost makes sense thats why even if it comes a lengthy two years later is a welcome event a disc thats not so much a remix album as a dub version re-imagining possibilities contexts frameworks of conventional remixing reinterpretations its an album as much about versioning as it is about getting hottest names of any given genre to put ir own name-power stamp on tracks result is a vibrant collection that attests to vitality of cross-genre electronic dance music right now as well as versatility imagination of martins original material kuedo sets tone in appropriately out- re fashion with his neon fibreglass dubstep constructed on top of while hype provides a sunblind synth envisioning of kode9 bunches up ltdown into needlepoint dance of his black sun material the attempts to reach beyond typical -associated names are even more exciting: mala makes most of kms considerable dubstep potential with his punishing remix of while put a playful circus-tent over same track a perfect microcosm of records stunning diversity the most successful tracks are actually riskiest: deepchord presents provides a fascinating deconstruction of suspending kevin martins darting basslines in a dissolute dub techno fog while nite drapes in her trademark woozy synths for indubitable album highlight something that sounds daringly different yet not at all incongruous one of more interesting aspects of album is series of revoices an example of how album caters more to a dub inspiration than anything else instead of remixing tracks vocalists replace original vocal tracks with ir own leaving instrumental intact it doesnt always work joel s childlike voice doesnt gel with groups music but when it does results are stunning as y dbridges reverb-soaked takes rival originals perhaps biggest compliment one can pay to is that over 15 remixes of a 13-song album it never feels like were stuck with same song over over again nor are we getting a thrown-toge r mixed bag of misfits much like its musical parent effortlessly inhales exhales str s of musical influence past present future
picture the scene ve spent the last eight or so years as the most recognisable figureheads of an organisation that s still regarded as an archetypal minimal techno behemoth despite your best efforts to branch away from the tag ve watched at first hand the subgenre s progression from the furthest fringes of dance music ( was set up in part because mayer and co s distributor at the time didn t believe there was a market for their sound) to a lumpen saturated beast a soundtrack to the glammed-up posing of supermarket sheep clubbers who pay significantly more attention to their brand of sunglasses and the angularity of their hairstyles than the quality of music they re dancing to what to do what s left to prove in a scene that regardless of its popularity is continually derided by even its most acclaimed proponents for its relentless sense of functionality of whacked-out intoxication of infinitely plagiaristic vacuity if you re axel super schaufler and michael mayer mayer you make an album that references italo punk-funk ambient ny house detroit electro-pop and a touch of medieval folk music that s what in fact you reference pretty much everything you can think of except for the conventional minimal techno sound that you helped make famous genius idea or is it it s fair to say that s highly anticipated concept (ugh) opus is set to be a divisive album right off the bat anyone who s looking for tracks of dj-friendly cologne-style clubbiness will be sorely disappointed actually anyone who s looking for a considered intelligent sophisticated electronic workout probably will be too but for the of the population who don t give a shit about high production values or cutting-edge sound design this is the album that completes s evolution into the bona fide independent pop label it always longed to be intro snippet sets the tone with a nursery-melody and a comically ominous vocal a neat metaphor for the album s pervasive oxymoronic blend of childish naivety and industrial heaviness it s a feeling that continues through the slap-happy fun of where axel schaufler s not-really-in-tune vocals are endearing and obtuse in equal measure and on into a searing overblown pumper more in line with mayer s usual techno-drama and m is a bow-legged ska-no quacker that again will upset those with an aversion to daft noises madness meets the lcd soundsystem perhaps while the teary-eyed archaic campfire strum of lonely notwithstanding its air of ridiculousness is a strangely touching lament and certainly unique in its field from here the album turns its attention more closely to the four-four pulse of the dancefloor but again with mixed occasionally antagonistic results rise is an chirpy piano-led disco shuffle taking its cue from lindstrom terje et al but failing to replicate the norwegians beguiling melodic charms with much conviction is a tad disappointing too its spiky detroit-ish chord pattern rasping unpleasantly atop a pernickety directionless groove those recurrent comedy-horror processed vocals don t help much either happily the album s closing tracks just about make up for the shortcomings is the rave monster that fans will have been holding out for its brutal surging noisiness the true sound of the pair at their wild wantonly apocalyptic best tellingly it s the most typically track here and may prove a source of frustration to many fans couldn t they have done a load of tracks like this instead of all that conceptual nonsense answer is yes of course they could but whether you like it or not have clearly decided to force themselves out of the minimal mould here indeed to conform entirely to their fans expectations would have ultimately put them back in the perfunctory category of artists described at the start of this review my own reaction to the album like others it seems was initially pretty negative but following a summer of hearing it creep up all over the place it s somehow grown on me offering numerous previously ignored charms each time i hear it again like a new acquaintance who seems a bit weird and irritating at first save world slowly reveals its warm-heartedness over time and ends up being one of your good buddies although not necessarily one you can truly love
ever since by was featured by john digweed on a radio one mix last year it has been one of the most sought after tunes and the rumours began to circulate that it would be appearing on bedrock however it hasnt and has instead surfaced on relatively new label maris music and follows up the equally impressive soup by rouzbeh delavari is one of those stunning pieces of music which just builds and builds from the simple percussion to its deep and driving bassline it takes you on a journey into sound the best though is saved till the break down where some lush and moody pads are brought in and its almost like listening to progressive house from about 5 years ago but is so classicly done it still sounds current this is a bedrock tune all over and is a perfect antidote to all the elecroclash stuff thats floating about now the remix on the flip is leaning much more to the electro sound of now and for me doesnt work as well it doesnt have the simple beauty of the original and doesnt work as well overall this is an excellent release for maris and a track which i think you will be hearing quite a lot of this summer
the opening of what the press release touts as s follow-up to its you that sparse track that went from limited edition vinyl to adverts for a supermarkets budget bikinis sounds unerringly familiar recorded in the same session starts with a similarly sultry vocal from with just a clap for company and in the inevitable comparison it comes up short so its a relief that red d and san soda decide not to totally tread old ground instead moving into a terrace-ready anthem thats rattling with piano stabs and subs that hum like a poorly grounded mixer deetrons mix seems equally aware of the its you spectre offering double the intro before presenting a fuller version of the original with the structure maintained but all the gaps stuffed with chuntering hi-hats and the lead riff transplanted from tinkled piano to a neon-tinged synth the strength of s vocal should render the dub redundant although it serves to show just how lacking the remix feels without it
as revealed in a recent interview likes to delve deep into the harder end of breakbeat and is well documented in his latest release side a breakdown sinister bass and breaks is the theme for breakdown featuring plenty of squelchy stabs and samples which create the melodic basis for the track the melody has a slight mediterranean feel to it the kick drums thump away drumming into your forehead while keeps the breaks tight with some intelligent programming breakdown feels a little subdued making it a good opening/post climactic tune for a set side b hey hey has a layo bushwacka feel to it organic drum breaks with a jazzy bassline to accompany it sounds like a double bass player has been commissioned to play breaks on this cut on vocals duties is a male vocal sample that can t seem to get enough of counting to the beats apparently the hum massive was going nuts to this it s good just not something i personally got into fans of deep tech breaks will enjoy
speaking to the quietus in january 20 4 louis carnell hinted at a new project in the works: a sidestep uncharted territory he called it when pressed on the subject he said i dont want to change i just want to develop ive found where im comfortable but i cant just play on my comforts i need to play on my ability and go out and explore again he was talking about the debut album for an impressive glimpse into a sleek unsettling future arrives after a long line of adventurous eps all grounded in grime but playing fast and loose with the rules 20 3 was carnells breakout year helmed by a classic three-tracker for leisure system snakes his take on techno for ramp m / secrets and the poignant im fine for lit city trax some ways the latter record laid the groundwork for as it pushed the south londoners trademarks breathy stonewashed vocals and keys to frigid new heights it also marked a drift further into the unknown by a producer already on the outskirts of familiar bass music carnell has left worldly hangups behind him on boldly casting off into the void with just the bare essentials traces of grime and footwork are everywhere but theyre decomposed to the point that those terms no longer apply has evolved well beyond identifiable bass nodes in favour of a hyper-digital frontier ruled by artificial telligence and sentient devices its this conflict between man and machine that lies at the heart of the album a sci-fi conceit played out through carnells complex vocal engineering the human voice vital to any record takes on a decisive role: its the main instrument the main sound throughout whether in lush choral form or steeped in reverb and lurking in the background carnells voice manipulations blur the lines between humanity and artificiality in dense highly fabricated melodies is an incongruous blend of calm and anxiety its also full of raw human emotion the residue of all those displaced voices like wailing souls left behind from the albums opening gambit strangled helium-pitched cries make it clear wont be an easy ride next recalls autechre outside of the vaporous moans chimes and swirling clouds that thicken as the album surges on they break up over s most identifiably grime track but the effect is still wraith-like leading up to ceaselessly queried and redressed itself like a computer running through software checks this track however collapses into binary blips and beeps processed squeaks and prattling its a bleak end of the line picture and in the closing half gives over to what sounds like a high contrast sample winding itself down for the last time the three closing tracks are as serene as gets yet never offer much comfort is haunted full of jarring strings and alien choirs by the end it feels strung out and restless racked with more questions than answers
of all gerald donalds non-drexciya projects established in 1995 has most successfully endured where drexciya imagined an underwater world populated by the children of pregnant women thrown off slave ships the duo of donald and to nhan fetishize science if not for the occasional vocal sigh their expansive and lonely electro might sound like music made without any human input but have a surprising pathos a melancholy more pronounced than drexciyas its a trait that might seem unlikely for a group so obsessed with machinery but its surfaced on their records for the berlin label who helped revive the once-dormant project return to the label for their first album in ten years one where the beats fall away and expose the duos haunting melodies on the ambient negative space dominates the empty sprawl of their last album 2007s calabi yau space was equally naked but it could also feel alienating even confusing here zoom in on the elements that disturb the silence simple sounds feel bold and physical that might have something to do with the albums title and concept in a cellular automaton individual cells interact to form step-based patterns or structures each of these tracks is like a close-up of the fragments that make up s music without drums or many of the other components that have previously shaped the duos sound if is one of s most ambient records its also one of their most powerful nhan and donalds brittle synths are as heavy as panes of glass and their icy chord progressions send a chill through the musics metallic surfaces the thick congealed bassline on the particulate sounds of pascals the buzzing electrical sounds on every track has a vivid texture most of the album presents strange mystifying fragments but on everything briefly comes together like s showstopping delta wave from 2013 its a lesson in economical arrangement in physics and mathematics isotropy refers to complete uniformity and the track is nothing if not in perfect harmony moments like this make the duos most mesmeric record to date but the beatless approach also makes it one of their most shadowy its a deeper and more intimate look at the duo who remain as enigmatic as ever
listening to s 2008 hair down ep released on idiot music when he was still living in the uae its remarkable how skilled in the art of sonic oppression he was even then these early works feel airless and clotted with ideas with the young producer just 16 at the time often prising apart the densely packed productions allowing silence to engulf the listener released on home to his two well-received 2011 eps exxy and division kamau baaqis debut bears little superficial resemblance to these likeable pieces however the use of space enclosed and disquieting still forms the central crux of his music one of the first sounds you hear on is an industrial thrum marking out the yawning parameters with its shuddering sweep an exercise in minimalism the scorched syncopated kicks of seem to spend the tracks entirety trying to lurch free of the pendulous g-force of the sub like many producers working in dubsteps fertile wake baaqi knows how to make emptiness feel pregnant with dread elsewhere contracts the cavernous atmospherics into a booming exercise in 808 percussion while manipulates dub technos bodily pulsations slowing them to down to a medicated spasm where every gasp of chord feels pockmarked obfuscated like its been corrupted by electrical interference much has been made of baaqis journeyman status born in detroit his family emigrated to abu dhabi with baaqui eventually moving on to london not surprising then that feels dislocated sealed off captures the smoked out insularity of early dubstep while its also knowing: expulsions of sawtooth synths and washes of horror movie ambience encircle a girlish vocal intoning this is it the sample as you can probably imagine is pitched down just at the right moment s a highlight of course once youve gone that far theres a tendency for the atmosphere to curdle and become wearying the nearest baaqui comes to cracking the window is the beatless where plucky arpeggiated synths provide the nearest semblance of reprieve even so its to the young producers credit that the overpowering bleakness and obtuse angles of never become weary remaining compelling even at their most oppressive
on the 2nd disc of the felt love ep by carter swain we see an instrumental of felt love feature on the b-side while on the a-side we see a new production by the duo shake is that track on the a-side and it is probably the highlight of the two discs a nice cheeky electro melody is the highlight as well as a deep baseline that rides beneath the percussive and electro elements it s a very solid production from the duo especially when the beautiful string patterns of the track kick in the intrumental mix of felt love is on the flip and this mix is a deep and dirty interpretation of the mixes on disc one and to be honest it is probably stronger then those two mixes the low end sounds dominate here as well as a some twisted sounds and effects that help make this mix what it is a stronger disc here then the first disc with two solid productions that have variety unlike the combo on the first disc
anyone who has heard the full-length richie hawtin de9:transitions mix will be familiar with s lost which was originally released in 2001 on the remains imprint bringing us up to date with his current audio airings is this release this time on the label the title track begins with plenty of hi-end as a skippy snare propels the track into motion a well-defined synth manifests itself early on following some single key stabs which filter in and out at stages to add caprice using these keys minute melodies are assembled - demanding our attention and allowing the track to circulate freely the synth assumes the role of the bassline for this part of the piece becoming the only real constant in the equation thus far but this format is shattered soon after as everything stops dead then something wonderful happens - a real bassline enters the fray giving a moodiness and edge to an otherwise unsullied piece of music before the other elements rear their heads again this quirky little number could be quite a useful track to have in the box and might appeal to the more versatile dj though one might be forgiven for assuming that this is just a piece of good electronica without any alignment to any particular scene or with a definite orientation towards a club floor (7/10) gonadotrpin on the flipside acts as the perfect foil to the a-side in the sense that it seems to be geared much more at the dancefloor opening with squelchy handclaps it doesnt take long to grab the listener using all the right ingredients in all the right places to initate an enchanting groove sonar bleeps a solid kick-drum and that little start/stop digi-disco loop keep reverberating while a subdued synth is buried in behind all this pausing momentarily were soon off again as the hi-end gets more acknowledgement and its heads down all the way personally speaking this track is my favourite of the two and really intrigued me from the start with the way it uses just enough tempo to get the head nodding without losing its composed nature minimal but by no means overtly nominal in the usage of its elements this track should suit those who like to build up from deep in their set with an ambition to really work that groove when the time is right (8/10)
skudge once a duo but now the solo project of elias landberg is one of modern dance musics key minimalists nailing loop techno on a series of self-released eps that date back to 2010 theres a subtle flair to his best tracks especially those on the latest ep on his label every element is considered and impactful which results in two effective tunes that dont sacrifice character for functionality where some skudge tunes are muddled by a thick atmosphere is among the projects leanest tunes it sounds like something youd hear in a scenario -era en klock or marcel dettmann set with hints of dub techno synths a loud clap and most importantly a rolling groove bolstered by a killer bassline its a guaranteed bomb capped off with a hi-hat that always seems to land at the right time the melancholic is the eps deeper option but it also manages to inject ample character into a reduced framework whichever side you reach for is a sure-shot that recalls the streamlined precision of skudges breakout early tracks
following the impressive dream traveller release on is label manager with his summer anthems and whateverisleft chris is really staring to make his impace in the production front after his fine effort with losing wait this is no different on the a-side is from the word go this production has lots of energy with some intense beat structure the track continually builds first with some nice and not too over the top driving synths and a subtle vocal sample the baseline then enters and takes it a step up accompanied with another subtle element in the piano line the track builds until the breakdown where a melodic string accompanies the lovely sounds and effects combined with the chunky baseline as the track hits its peak the piano melody changes tone to nice effect another solid work from mr fortier on the flip is whateverisleft in essence this is a toned down mix of the a-side but rather then just a dub it has different elements that make this quite unique in itself the drums are very similar but the baseline is more electro sounding the melodies are used a lot earlier in this mix than in the flip plus the track has a more continuous arrangement quite a good change in direction with this version another release with solid production on each side getting big airplay already from the big djs this record is sure to get noticed
conceptually a release entitled could hint at everything in general and nothing in particular however the glistening distorted environment that this uk bass-inclined ep generally evokes is quite specific; the four tracks here all doing something a little bit different while remaining part of the same general unsettling template slowed-down swing of alternates between sharp-as-a-needle breaks and spacial incandescence is all low-end and rim shots hinting at a lively car chase sounds like a gruelling journey to the heart of the bass its a robust track that blossoms when the synths wash around its core isnt that dissimilar but the general tone is lighter even though its augmented by spectral strings that could have accompanied vincent price on a killing spree

the sleeve of s first record bearing a photograph of a greek statue and screenprinted with an intense black ink is an apt prologue for the music inside is both beautiful and weighty this is expected from an artist like real name manuel fogliata hes best known as half of aquaplano with donato dozzy and like his collaborator his solo work maneuvers fluidly through pristine techno and ambient fogliata has been silent since the aquaplano days but hes returned this year with more abstract aims on the italian producer puts aside the turbulence of before yet his cinematic grandness remains is an exception its very much aquaplano techno: dubby atmospheric and swimming in reverb and delay the result is mucky and psychedelic but subtle to the point where it never quite stirs fogliata maintains this balance throughout the record which works better on tracks that are more soundscape than functional is a mood piece suffused with loneliness tunneling on endlessly with vaporous synths and a single tapping drum the records prettiest track has the same density of fluttering textures but pulses at 30 bpm slower on fogliata puts an oscillating synthesizer over gorgeously blushing ambience simple as it is it captures s sophisticated tranquility at its most striking
slow nocturnal house continues to gradually gain traction across several scenes as tempos continue to drop and colours fade particular penchant seems to be forming for it in the uks dub mecca as ristol showers newfound attention on its wave of producers making sub-heavy variations on lumbering house and heavy jacking techno ristolian joe cowton mostly belongs to the former camp his recent productions showing him to be the most promising of the kassem mosse acolytes taking a barebones sound and putting his own sleepily virtuosic and basswise take on it all theres no better place to look for this particular ristol sound right now than and s second splash for the label shows him working further towards a more distinctive sound dont is explicitly uk in origin endowing its bobbing elements with a playful swing and (of course) a stuttering vocal sample these jumpy tics stand directly at odds with its slow dramatic sustain unsettling grumble of a bassline and horror movie-calibre bells the track as if uncertain vacillates between sections of free-floating dread and considerably muscular percussive flex the flipside is darker and certainly more difficult lacking the grasping points of its counterpart with a disorienting staggered hat/kick configuration that lives up to the tracks title the only non-percussive adornments spared by cowton are a rumbling synth line and resonant notes like someone running their finger excruciatingly slowly across the rim of a wine glass but even these are completely devoid of colour s vision of house is grim and desaturated but its also a little groovy and his drum programming flair and dub-learned basslines turn the soot-caked skeletons into something danceable and even sensual
the second release from paris cracki label and the duo s debut this really isnt a dance record indeed and are straight-up indie pop featuring chiming guitars close-harmonized vocals and 60s-inspired drumming they lie somewhere between kings of convenience jose gonzalez and vintage slumberland records but is different: its still a pop song at heart but its crisp drum break looping chords and chopped-up vocal harmonies edge it back towards the programmed-music end of the spectrum in both its elements and overall feel its strikingly similar to pezzners two dots from a couple of years back but its mood is even more beguiling fluttering like a quickened heart between wistfulness and bright-eyed cheer its perfect for lovers mixtapes; file under crush grooves
supafly are australias mister p and christos (ultrasun) from melbourne with one from london on vocals the cover of this cd single certainly took me by surprise looking for all the world like a reggae album pop it in the cd player though press play and you are hooked s lets get down sounds like a delightful summery house song that is a cross between bob marley and funkstar deluxes the sun is shining my cd single package features 7 different edits and mixes though unfortunately my review copy is not credited there are two radio edits with the first being a straight up house tune i usually dislike radio edits but with this tune it quickly and simply portrays the best of this song - good lyrics male vocals and a tune that sticks in your head while you wiggle your bum the second radio edit is a slowed breakbeat version that lacks the catchiness of the original and is marred by cheesy synth breaks which return on several of the full length tracks version four of lets get down goes disco with all top end sounds over the booty shaking beat version five takes a spin at urban sounds being slowed right down with prominent vocals and backing vocalists on the chorus the song is very stripped back in this version version six is the full length breakbeat version and just doesnt work well for me as the vocals dont sit well with the music version seven is a longer version of the first radio edit with some funky house percussion under it and those synths again this mix and version four get the balance right between club sounds and the radio version reggae meets house - i like
samo forsbergs latest release on continues an ongoing partnership with takenori 5ive goto that dates back to 2008 the tracks were recored during the studio sessions that birthed last years some song teachers on public possession with the addition of forsberg told me he spent a week in tokyo recording with the pair last summer and reminisced about gotis e-mu sampler and korg triton which was found discarded on a street only s title track features all three producers but the same sense of humidity permeates the whole record its not clear who did what on the track s pleasant dubby sheen coats a subtle nine-minute progression a casual listen will leave the tinny synth motif nestled in your memory but also focus on the tracks peculiar details there is a more immediate dynamic to where a rumbling low-end jostles with chirruping keys and xylophone might be the best track forsberg and goti utilise the e-mu sampler but its the delayed korg tones smeared like a greedy kid spreading peanut butter on bread that grab you
the day has finally come: blawan and his hero surgeon have collaborated on paper its the kind of thing that should end the world kick drums to displace the earth and blackened basslines to blot out the sun of course in reality it was never likely to end up as a techno pissing contest and true enough the debut 12-inch from sounds more like blawan with help from his mentor than a drum machine apocalypse like rusted barbed wire these tracks cut and scrape at the same time sets the tone appropriately by dragging a knife across your speaker cones like a particularly spirited leftover from blawans his he she this one hurtles stiff drums and menacingly mumbled vocals through wave after wave of screeching distortion and tinnitus-inducing shrieks notching up the tempo is considerably more melodic and certainly much faster balancing the ebm influence you always knew was there in blawan the punky descending bassline like something the buzzcocks would have written provides something to latch onto amidst the careening machinery like some malfunctioning carnival ride that just gets faster and faster the flipside takes us through even harsher climes the militaristic march of is all portent and thrum with abrasive noise while is just plain ugly matching its burnt-out textures with a swing that arcs at right angles the ep closes on a note of deliriously pleasing carnage two figures known for their sonic extremity taking the opportunity to beat their techno to a bloody pulp their veritable snuff film isnt exactly a new one but its fun to watch all the same
for those who are only aware of s late-2000s output might seem to come out of leftfield on this new 10-inch the surgical sound has made way for something warmer and more immediate like nidams earlier work these two tracks are doggedly horizontal and lean heavily to the trippy end of house music but theres a pleasing emphasis on the character inherent in the instruments and effects used to record these tunes i found the b-side to be my favourite track of nidams career either because or in spite of its apparent simplicity its largely to do with a pint-sized tinkling lead line which picks out a series of pitches that are fragile yet reassuring its offset by an increasingly gnarly bass tone that begins blunted and low-passed before opening up into a rabid snarl the claps and a noise cymbal highlight the second beat creating something of a half-time feel despite the tunes light-stepping momentum has a far heavier atmosphere its not exactly designed for headlong forward momentum but its broken kick pattern and sizzling top-end set the stage for dramatic dubwise rim shots and a rippling bass that lurks in the low-mid frequencies its joined by a reaching distorted lead line but despite the growing cacophony of elements your attention is largely subsumed by the dank but breathing atmosphere of machines and effects
oth on the front cover to his latest 12-inch and on the music therein is busy doodling away once again sketching out cracked out visions of future soul lucky for us weve caught him (or his alter ego pictured on the cover) in the milky way terminal for now fter docile keys lull you into a false sense of security parrish starts to float aimlessly notelessly on before introducing the bassline and drums that will take you on the rest of your way the track sounds a bit like one: while the tune clearly owes its heritage to acid house the fidelity of the recording and the effects placed on each element is decidedly otherworldly it could just as easily be pounded out as a skull-numbing set-changing rocker or played as background music at your next (hip techno-inclined) dinner party thats all in the eqing i suppose and its something that parrish has always been known to use/abuse ably the -side is something else altogether suitable for last calls for alcohol and t-pain karaoke sessions danny anks vocals are filtered through uto-tune ( t least i think they are ) its hard to know what to make of this but parrishs marijuana-soaked stutter soul backing has enough funk for you to ignore categorization and simply enjoy the show yet another essential package from one of electronic musics most unpredictable artists
t2 is the debut single from newcomers who pop their cherry with a slice of subliminal house that cuts across the genres: its part progressive part electrohouse and part techno list a bundle of artists from the motor city as major influences and perhaps its no surprise that has hints of the early scifi techno of model 500 and aux 88 the original mix is the slowest and least lively but its held together by spacey casio keys and an intoxicating buzzing sound that should work wonders on a good set of speakers while the alternative remix has the same groove as the original cocktailed with a deeper more dramatic sound from the word go yoshi chandler s remix suggests its going to give this track its all and it does housier for the party heads this mix spices up the original with a vocal effects and even a didgeridoo-esque bassline elsewhere dj each and kid dub weigh in with electrohouse remixes but they do little to add to the original the former has all the finesse of a super mario cart soundtrack while the latter goes nowhere slowly but the standout here is the sublime leon roberts remix: melodic but intense deep house that strips back the electro elements and leaves behind subtle build ups and a sensual rhythm highly recommended is well worth a listen its various mixes are already being flogged by hernan cattaneo funk d void and desyn masiello but the leon roberts one is your best friend

following his intriguing but often frustrating pretty ugly lp stalwart scratcha has been on an impressive run of form last years fly juice ep was a colourful bizarre and often banging dissection of house music streets ahead of most uk house operators in terms of inventiveness the ep is something of a partner piece (the two eps are also being combined for a cd release) taking a similarly chaotic tilt at the dance floor scratcha told ra earlier this year that hed been taking inspiration from the wild rhythms and shock-out dynamics of recent a e up sound singles s tempting then to see as a uk funky counterpart to say ahead ; pushes the styles rhythmic conventions to perverse extremes peppering the mix with restless syncopations and leaving yawning holes in the groove the whole thing is pretty confounding but the unhinged highlight is the breakdown where a tinny boogie interlude operating at a totally different tempo drifts into view jars stutters and lurches us back into the beat scratcha can be forgiven for deploying such an excellent a trick twice though in its with a snippet of digi-dub and the host body is a southern rap-inspired rhythm track burrito was last heard on kode9s recent rinse mix and its oddly prim triplet-leaning beat isnt so distant from kodes recent singles (even if the ridiculously gauche drops are scratchas alone) finally turns in a remix of fly juice highlight s a typically refined effort but someone should have told our man he wasnt needed; scratchas got things firmly in hand here
as usual with most of the tracks on s album are collaborative efforts with other members of the crew its his first release for the chicago footwork label and its a bit of a mixed bag with inspired moments as well as awkward ones best tunes and feature and the late whom the crew continues to memorialize by reinventing his unfinished tracks both are built on warm soulful melodies that suggest a wistful nostalgia like dancing outdoors on the last day of summer y have an emotional depth and dynamism you wont find elsewhere on this record re are seven tracks on and almost as many stylistic mutations represented dont featuring is a booty juke brag track about stealing someone elses girlfriend at the club as far as juke and ghetto house goes its not that vulgar compared to say the paul johnson single suck my candy cane but where a lot of those tracks are so ridiculously over-the-top that theyre hilarious this one smacks of run-of-the-mill machismo and ends up feeling bland re are also a couple of breakbeat tracks: the jungle-footwork hybrid featuring and and the album closer a sparse hip-hop instrumental made with does the trick with its colossal bassline built from pitched 808 bass drums but the samples arent particularly memorable and the production quality leaves something to be desired seems like an early sketch for a very interesting idea that ultimately doesnt do much which is strange considering s excellent album from last year a fully-formed statement that fleshed out a singular aesthetic s only solo track on the album falls flat its 160-bpm dubstep feels more or less paint-by-numbers from the awkward wobble bass to the dark atmospherics and dub samples s most sophisticated moments offer brief flashbacks to double cup s game-changing album from 2013 but where s best work was light and agile like an expert dancer some of s tracks feel like theyre dragging their feet
owner of s o paulo nightspot d-edge and part-owner of warung beach club has long been at the forefront of brazils underground dance movement looking to add a further string to his bow for ratier releases his debut ep on his own d-edge records reflecting his nations cultural and musical heterogeneity all three tracks are collages of disparate sound melds shiny guitar funk with techy grooves jazzy hooks and stern chords busy though it is this disco-led slice of tech house keeps to an engaging course toes a more emotive line moving from thick and trippy through to lush and progressive with considerable ease combines elevated piano lines and dreamy gospel samples with gritty daft punk-esque grunts and catchy synths while this debut at times feels cluttered it conveys an invigorating disregard for convention that should ultimately charm even the most critical ear
johnny and kenny glasgows time as may only be a comparatively short slice of their respective music careers but its taken the adian producers to a new level of recognition maintaining momentum from the string of singles and albums that began in 2010 they take on the next edition of no 19 musics social experiment mix series their first compilation with gusto ending its hiatus since 2011s soul clap helmed debut at first glance the tracklisting doesnt hold too many surprises re are a clutch of exclusives adding a fresh feel with and s opening things brightly ed with reverb its babbling melody flows into s vibrant mix of s the chattering tumbling vox offset by a familiar pitched down menace striking vocals add class in and excel amid the angry leads and acid bleeps of of as the emphasis moves from leisurely to peak time in fact the high and lowlights of the mix are also vocal led: a nod to the early 00s with and bryan s appearance on s are an unexpected joy while zarus appearance on the expansive feels incongruous s taut and symmetric carefully reigns in the more muscular middle third of the mix while a trio of exclusives close things out first is the 909 infused from fellow adians s ificial follows its melody caught between pulsating bassline and glistening synths before ending on s own its a boisterously enjoyable and skilfully compressed journey and a further evolution in an already promising mix series

is a relatively new project by jack hamill who as space dimension controller has released concept records such the r s album welcome to mikrosector-50 its a departure in the sense that records are focused on the more terrestrial concerns of the dance floor rather than space dimension controllers vivid sci-fi narratives the second in a series of 12-inches correlation 2 s three tracks may lack the overarching concepts of space dimension controller releases but their intergalactic spirit and playful mood is still here in full force pivots on an irrepressibly catchy funk bassline dotted with disco synths that are equally cosmic and spirited is all hulking drum-machine hits powerful claps and darting melodies but it only really picks up momentum after the breakdown h pairs a languid groove with space-disco touches and splashy percussion although it isnt hugely original correlation 2 is machine-funk at its most colourful and vibrant
last years reeling skullways lp was a characteristic response to the uks recent house and techno obsession the framework was borrowed from chicago but the bright modular synth-derived melodies could only have been concocted in ralph cumbers hackney lab nd while the results werent entirely convincing was an exception largely because it set the synths loose allowing them to float freely in the cosmic terrain charted by early utechre and plaid this ep re-release of the track plays to another of cumbers strengths: his range new mix explores kowton-esque grime-gone-techno all spiky syncopated snares loping kick and a generous helping of smashed glass but cumbers angle is as you might expect warmer and a little less spartan (the juicy bassline is a particular pleasure) in neat contrast and mirroring the sample-based deconstructive paper round tapes series his mix as coseph reconfigures the track into a beatless joy-overload finally boss peverelist follows his strategy remix on idle hands with another distinctly different offering: this time the template is sunny slow-mo house the dappled chord work and perky bassline make it a surprisingly cheery outing for pev a response perhaps to the subtle sense of mischief that pervades cumbers work
have been at it for a while now delivering a mellow blend of funk fused dub since their early releases of chocolate elvis and fuck dub back when the k d sessions were yet to be released upon the unsuspecting public and since the genre forming excitement of k d s remixes much of s releases have been relatively down played becoming a secret passion for those truly in love with the sounds coming from the g-stone stable truth be known though the duo consisting of richard dorfmeister and rupert huber have been rather prolific since those early singles releasing long players such as opera and suzuki as well as a slew of remix compilations of tunes from those albums (suzuki in dub and different taste of honey) and this year the pair have released yet another winner in the form of delhi9 pushing their sound even further into the sparse regions of instrumental dub groove the sounds are definitely a little different from past releases with most of the bass being played on a warm electronic fretless bass and the melodies sounding fresh with piano organ and flute tones all still dubbed up with filtered echo s as per their usual style there is also a larger assortment of vocalist with the return of anna clementi plus the introduction of tweed on the brilliant dub house tune gute loune and earl zinger on the first single wonderful some who know me personally might say that i could not objectively write a review of s material but what do they know i think the album is bloody brilliant it s a lovely mix of trip hop acid jazz dub house and bossa groove and while all that might sound a bit much the coherency of the instrumentation provides a flow from tune to tune that leaves the hips rocking like waves on a summer beach and just to prove my contemporaries wrong there is in my opinion one dud on the anna clementi sung me yoko ono find themselves being quirky rather than kinky i prefer kinky but that s just me so all up a good buy and another quality release from the g-stone label and you also get a second cd which contains minimal piano arrangements written by rupert huber and dubbed up by dorfmeister which is also a beautiful listen top job lads bring on the remixes i say
dwelling in the well-worn minimal realm staked out by labels such as m_nus has emerged from detroit with a fresh approach to the minimal template infusing it with an old-school motor city vibe that brings some palpable soul into the machine on the a-side lee take on troxlers is a seriously deep slice of minimal techno the spaciousness of the original lends itself perfectly to claustrophobic production as the kick drum rises in the mix the rest of the track s constituent parts are reduced to a mass of clicking tones and percussive patterns everything shaded over with frozen reverb version may play out as icy techno adapted to polar climes and dank club environs but troxler s original features a sprightly beat and swells of glistening echo more suited to neon lights s a far less intimidating beast to be sure but it s by no means any less effective although it s barbaro s on the flip that really raises an eyebrow wafting in on a few strands of warm ambience the track settles into a stylish groove adorned by lush pads and tasteful sound design that adds a touch of depth to the mix just as things seem to be settling into a classic nocturnal detroit groove troxler brings in a ridiculously sleazy bassline and breaks the whole thing down only to build it back up into a dominating dance floor engine topped off with a warped vocal sample that brings to mind a sexed up version of villalobos remix of blood on my hands this is prime music for the late night stretch is more proof that troxler is a young producer to watch and with alliances being formed with spectral sound and a host of other labels let s hope the follow-up lives up to the expectation
about this time last year fernando seixlack was sitting on two fairly significant cassette releases one was a live recording for l a club resource as innsyter and the other was a collaborative projest for thingamajicks subsubtropics records called jammmmmms the innsyter tape was 60-odd minutes of gnarled dilapidated drum machine abuse; jammmmmms was a far more sunny affair recorded at home with fellow s o paulo artist pedro zopelar in a recent ra interview l a club resources henoch moore said that the label (which has since released innsyters debut album ) tended towards a bedroom production style defined by an experimental creative approach and a resourcefulness indeed seixlacks productions are homespun his style is defiant qualities that make both sides of his output so commanding his latest record is a set of mangled lo-fi club jams with their own deviant sense of beauty points to where innsyters acerbic techno-punk material comes from with the grot of an old den haag squat record and a warm floating synth that counters the acid grunge the rest of the ep has more in common with jammmmmms bright freewheeling machine funk; the rackety and electro-licked are particular highlights
the moody claustrophobic debut from london trio is an immaculate marriage of groove-centered post-punk and early acidic warp-style synth percolation its a slightly-more lysergic reincarnation of the factory records sound jacking into the transitional energies loosed right at that labels historical tipping point from mechanic rock to synth-pop somewhere around the time of new orders first record movement or section 25 circa looking from a hilltop while this has been oft-mined territory as of late and while its pretty easy to engage in the reference game with a sound so indicative of beloved past innovations isnt playing for style points or spot-the-influence brainteasers stylistic tendencies are neatly straddled and synthesized throughout such that you could get away with calling it electro-disco as it does make use of the rigid minimal and abrasive synth-lines of the former and rhythmic elements of the latter like handclaps tambourines and shakers but it also wouldnt be out of place in any number of other hyphenated critical neologisms original version is powered by a sonorous hi-verbed minor synth-bell riff that nicely dovetails the punchy aggressive live-drum groove that kicks in full-force after thirty seconds of post-punk portent distorted vocals intone in affectless industrial deadpan halfway through the track begins to drown precariously in swirling electronics like a levee in a storm then theres a moments breath of respite before the dam bursts and gushes towards the finish line an atmospheric energized gloom pervades but never swallows up the synth hooks and half-chanted singing the result being one of the more compelling live-band dance tunes youre likely to hear all year perhaps due to the density of the original both remixes here bushwack through the clutter to carve out expansive streamlined pressure-cookers that are allowed to gradually arc and coast the moscow remix takes the long road stretching out to thirteen minutes giving room for the acid-house inclinations to grow wings its a strategy of exhaustion playing out every compositional permutation for its own sake shaggy and tremendous its highly effective but at least four minutes too long nonetheless naum aka jonnie wilkes one half of optimo doesnt wildly alter the sonic recipe of the original leading his remix off with some added crisp echoey synth stabs that he lets carry the flag for the bulk of the mix it sounds mostly like hes given the track a good scrub-down washed off some of the manchester grit (including sadly the live kit propulsion) and given it a bow-tie in time for tea
with this being the tenth release for the ristol-based label started by tom ford k to reflect whats occurring in the south west dubstep scene there surrounds it a certain amount of expectation and trepidation that comes with hitting double figures on wax couple the anticipation heads will have after the slew of excellent releases on most recently gemmys glorious k 2 the future with the fact that skull disco a similarly diverse label just called it quits after exactly ten 12-inches and youve got a whole heap of presales and forum fodder right there even though does feature a pummelling flurry of sine wave pulses its not the bass pressure that this cut focuses on instead its the colourful layers of synthesizers and playfully pitched percussion that you cant help but latch onto letting his rhythm build steadily with the opening riffing the machine whining of the secondary hook evolves the track further upwards; building up the tension through a tight bout of flange until the primitive 80s shimmer-synth smothers the drums in its delay the flip indulges fords dubbier side lolling around in its own echo and punching through with its warm soundsystem spanning bass the track is a subdued creeper thats guaranteed to worm its way into your limbs ford consciously lets the inconspicuous stabs of melody pierce the mix oh-so subtly creating an enviable feeling of buoyancy like skull disco succeeds because of the risks it takes fords newest is a perfect example of how experimenting across two sides of vinyl for its naggingly catchy techno pulsations and for its sublime low end and measured subtlety can both work well in their respective fields and sound like something new altogether
if techno has recently hewn towards metal in its aggression and aesthetics then represent punk more ragged and volatile than outright heavy thats the ethos on the sampler ep for their upcoming compilation i care because you dont but sometimes you need more than just a fuck you attitude and aside from the duos own contribution i care because you dont comes off a little flimsy is up to their usual high standard way its crunchy drums skate on top of eerie pads recalls a harsher version of the aphex twin album the compilation references equal parts brutal and cushiony res a similarly satisfying texture to s which drunkenly balances on wobbly bass notes but the momentum fizzles away with some awkwardly placed vocal samples and general aimlessness s bezerkerz is a rudimentary attempt at uk hardcore nostalgia while s is an evil array of spurting noises and shrieks that becomes tiring over its four minute seizure res still hope for the full length compilation but im left with the feeling that we would have been better off with a new ep from themselves
with y frontin their recent ubiquitous collaboration with vocalist monty luke it was obvious polish duo catz n had a bona fide hit on their hands this commanding approach to tech house tropes was hinted at by the stuff showcased on their two studio albums (2008s stars of zoo and 2010s escape from zoo ) but it was never this conquering d intuitively think theyd want to cash in on this recent beatport/ra charted notoriety but their entry in the mix series and first ever official mix cd sees them going elsewhere mood they set on this 21 track 75 minute journey is impressively subdued subtle and cleverly contained if commercially available mixes are often an occasion for djs to self promote their own productions it isnt the case here catz n have only two of their own works on offer (their gleeful early 90s ny garage take on by toms and their more soulful version of s ) consequently the rest of the compilation is all about clever selection and sequencing maybe unsurprisingly the mixs meaty part is right in the middle as s eat s frenzied and by newcomer make for its most engaging sequence latter track then finds itself emotively intertwined with an older classic s which is then cleverly mixed with s a sassy piece of timeless hip house s is the selections most shining highlight though; its slow driven progression turns into a truly kaleidoscopic ride with trad house signifiers twisted into a disorientating escapade last third of the mix is in the same vein and becomes especially remarkable thanks to temperamental cuts from ( on baby ) and ( ) exclusive to the mix you also have by and amarian a gorgeous piece of delicate tolling and intertwined rhythms s on the other hand opts for disfigured bass based ambiances la holy other in the mixs haunting finale thus echoing the same atmospheres set by album opener by could call their approach minimalistic if the term wasnt so heavily charged nowadays but there is something classy and classic about catz n s approach here
it s the second disc of the dangerous inside ep by and this time we have 3 more original productions to accompany the two from the first disc on the a-side is deep funk fusion which is quite a quirky production the baseline is perhaps this tracks biggest asset as it rumbles almost non stop while surrounded by acid riffs smooth pads and eerie melodies first up on the flip is it s all about jazz and as the name suggests this is the smoothest production of the lot smooth house grooves build the track for the first half before the production gets a little grittier with an acid line in the latter parts of the track ivett concludes the ep with a more ambient feel as smooth and subtle beats surround beautiful string patterns and a delightful piano line another good solid disc to accompany the first disc and again good variety on this disc with three pretty different styles of productions on one disc
have recently turned to challenging rhythmically dense techno but their latest ep for eschews the concerns of the dance floor in favour of something moody and atmospheric brings to mind roly porter and bandshell artists who also skirt the edges of techno opens with ethereal pads and a smattering of noise think the falling beads of a rainmaker instrument before a powerful bass riff and a dry tom-led beat take over is less caustic with staccato piano chords and an ocarina-like melody that lends an eerie atmosphere to the straightforward techno beat picked clean of any extraneous fat is all metallic percussion and spacious frozen ambience the drumbeat when it comes sounds like the portent of some dark ceremony is epic and sprawling like oneohtrix point never at his noisiest with colossal synths that soar and crash in a dramatic conclusion to the ep
its always a refreshing palate cleanser to hear remixes before the original gone are the silly debates on what was added or what was taken away and the focus can simply be placed on the most important thing of all: whats actually there the mind does wander listening to me and dixons takes on radio slave new moniker and the first track from his forthcoming album though is there a lot of chanting going on me sure seem to have both the tropical and religious variety accounted for in their digital deep house version nd how about a kick drum that disappears for nearly two minutes me give you a cymbal for a bit but even that hinge leaves the building to allow the various chanters to have some time alone with one another in the most effecting moment of the mix dixons remake tends to confirm that there will be plenty of voices to be heard and his similarly tropic drum pattern also takes plenty of time to get to the point thats not a bad thing oth dixon and me create landscapes ripe for enough investigation to make waiting for the kick worth your time dixon piles on some horns as well adding to the thicket but things never feel too overwhelming over the top though perhaps the soprano doing her thing in the middle of the tune gets there ut the sort of confidence it takes to be putting an operatic wailer like this on a club record should be applauded not criticized nd with the remix being almost 12 minutes long and the dub being available for free download at shop theres plenty of chance to ignore her altogether if you so choose

from the retro label art to the stripped back sound theres a lack of pretension and a refreshing rawness about dext recordings first release shadowy bristolian producer who has released on oliver huntemanns ideal audio and bedrock is the man behind it on disembodied pitch-shifted vocals stud the dark rolling house beat which is punctuated by roaring bass leans towards the uk bass end of house with taut kicks and yawning chords providing a garage-y undercurrent the bristol love-in continues with the eps two remixes komon and work into fluid dubby techno with the drums stripped to the bone the pair even manage to percolate some ambient d b into the bridge its the pick of the five tracks komon constructs a piece of scuttling percussion-led house on his remix of some of the same tropes wash up on s as well as off-kilter congas and fluttering interference suggesting that another cross-city collaboration might be worth considering
boss has previously used traditional instruments in his music both in his previous incantation as an acid jazz musician and in his drum bass productions as well s why its no surprise to hear a few choice melancholy piano chords throughout the a-side slow jungle beat shimmers underneath occasionally joined by a gentle but effective pulse of bass while elsa esmeredas slightly accented voice alternates with a bouncing electronic note one of the very few parts of the tune that sounds like it was made on a computer this is a simple tune with very little too it and thats exactly its strength flip side is much more traditional drum bass fare populated with the signature piano riffs but with a much faster and more solid beat underneath complemented by some old skool trance synths in the breakdown something youll find in plenty of hospitals output
where decembers peekaboo ep found him doing jacking house shows in acid mode the linking quality between the records and the many others hes released in the last couple of years is their exploration of done-to-death forms of dance music but haus usually tweaks things for instance where most other producers would be happy to let the lead line of this eps just run its course haus breaks it up in a cascade of arps on he peppers classic acid ingredients with flashes of neck-snapping distortion these stylistic smarts dont always equate to gold with seven eps since 013 the frequency of hauss releases means a typical four-track ep usually has a strike rate of between 50 and 75 but even his less compelling cuts usually have a certain creative spark which is the case again on the plodding chiptune vibe of has a robotic charm but it doesnt stick in the mind past a few listens the title track and are slightly divergent products from similar ingredients copious low-end blocky 90s synths and delirious touches of distortion that both work well on their own terms the self-explanatory opener is the standout however with its euphoric 303 line and minimal vocal and percussive flourishes being worth the price of admission alone

troy pierce calls in friends inspirations and labelmates to rework tracks from his album an album of mentally disturbed techno for rainy murky evenings when you re locked up at home on remix duties are the very capable vivianne s donnacha rosaire and osvaldo but they ve got a tough assignment can they top the unhinged originals anxiety kicked off the tiefschwarz fabric mix a few months ago (to devastating effect) and here it s revisited as by vivianne s (aka jesse siminski the mind behind time for ensor ) siminski works in a driving offbeat kick and surrounds it with the original otherworldly vocal but this time its cut up stretched and morphed more compact and straight up than pierce s track whose mission seemed to be to drive the club insane is a track of rolling beats and evolving layered basslines that ll uplift the mood heartthrob s atari partner magda might road test this late into the morning when ears get warm and pretension levels drop past zero final by dc (aka donnacha in a shy mood) clutches a glitchy synth and shakes out stardust and nostalgia before the track accelerates into super-ferocious apocalyptic swirls and driving samples very dark indeed troy pierce remixed s bear bounces back and i guess this is returning the gesture the result: i could picture richie hawtin reaching for this 2 by rosaire sounds oddly like a troy pierce number with its deep moaning bassline and oodles of macabre melody the jacking chords and choppy atari game-like samples will invite shoulder shuffles from crackheads and rude boys definitely one for [email protected] late into the evening the ep finishes on ( the mix) by osvaldo who rumour has it might be bruno pronsato the mind behind wade in water children on unfound sound pronsato s cut will be a weapon of choice for many djs and here he leads from the front kicking off all broody and sensual with the slow overhang of the deranged vocal it s a wrong meeting type of track that will confuse any nightclub into submission on these remixes underline proves again vinyl is very much necessary: like leftroom and contexterrior they keep value for money very high by pressing four separate and tight edits these remixes are packed with contemporary ideas that push the boundaries into future confusion with added style and grace
no matter how high the quality of product throughout an artists career they are often remembered mostly for their first steps into the spotlight released way back in 1990 on transmat and for me at least its as memorable as anything else that has come before or has since sandwell get the honour here of remixing this titanic piece of anthemic originality and they do an absolutely splendid job they bring you slowly but surely into a world every bit as ethereal as the original with lisa newberrys vocals rendered more and more brittle as the bass envelops them my only real complaint is that its far too short: just as the track starts to reach another level about forty seconds from the end and threatens to fulfil its trance credentials (thats trance as in adjective by the way) its gone ril rikha does a similarly wonderful job with which originally saw the light of day as part of a double-header along with rolandos ztlan on underground resistance the original metallic synth stabs that underpin the track are kept intact but are more subdued than in the original over the top rikha glides washes of spaced-out colour in tandem with linear keys that sound deadpan against the backdrop ts a powerful driving and well-disciplined piece that sounds quintessentially northern european in tone and is also much more typical of s own sound
seems to be becoming s home of late as he drops his highly anticpated featuring the awesome vocals of stephanie vezina this track has been a staple in deep dishs djing diet recently and will also appear in the upcoming yoshitoshi ibiza compilation have delivered a great array of mixes from tommyboy mannel and clark chemistry the original is a deep slab of pure house goodness starting of with smooth beats low basslines and lush sounds stephanies vocal is sampled and floats in and out of focus before starting off with the first few versus of the lyrics low and soft stabbing synths play gorgeously over the beat while the vocal constantly echoes or moans giving a nice depth to the sound the laid back feeling of this track is emphasised in the breakdown and to add to this feeling a guitar sample is added perfectly this is a serious tune and so well done it oozes class moving into house territory the tommyboy housematic dub and vocal emphasis percussion to give it a strong dancefloor presence though keeping in tune with the original by using the low bassline as the original this is another slow builder which allows the track to chart out its territory by bringing in elements one at a time essentially giving it a great feel to any breakdown that happens the vocal is lightly scattered (in the dub) and works nicely along each corner of 4 or 8 beats this track seems more minimal than the original though some sustained atmospherics are added that work around the climax again this is a great production mannels mix adds something different to this collection of mixes with some quirky beats and percussion the mood is lightened with a more playful bassline though the moaning sustained vocal sample is used throughout a catchy light melody plays along while the breakdown features the guitar from the original and really is very powerful mood wise as the beat is brought slowly back in with an array of emotive synths as the track rolls onward the introduction of an edgy stabbing synth causes a slightly more chaotic feel though the rest of the elements stay in tack as the mix finishes slowly another great track the tommyboy remix packs more of a punch compared to his other mixes with a devastating bassline and strong beats the piano stabs are still present and the vocal is given more volume and space to work with though most parts of the track have been reworked definite main room tune lastly the clark chemistry mix ultilises a more hypnotic groove with the original bassline and rolling percussion though the addition of a simple melody is what really makes this track fly the vocals are still present but in a lesser form and the emotive synths are given that extra light throughout the breakdown is a brilliant array of vocal effects synths and melodic goodness but as the beat is dropped back in all sounds are removed to give way to the thick bass very smooth reviewing this collection of mixes has been an absolute pleasure the sounds are amazing production is so smooth stephanie vezinas vocal is very pleasing to the ear and i really like how each mix encapsulates the original but shows their own brillance quite possibly the best production by (and a great collection by )
the second 12-inch from intercontinental dance organisation or is a deep house record with lofty aspirations in recent interviews s founders and matthieu amila discussed the spiritual dimension of their labels music where some house records might express that with gospel vocals or church organs s approach is meditative its three tracks are long and unhurried synth pads glide like an airplanes contrails over percussion with tranquilised delays and reverbs where s last record could feel repetitive s tracks flower more easily mora is better known as the producer french fries whose music translates various styles ghetto house techno uk bass jersey club with enthusiastic literacy in the soothing bass and percussion of the urgency of his past work washes away the new age of a drumless version of the other b-side track is as calm and spacious as the rainforest lagoon suggested by the birdsong and swirls of water preserves that sense of space in a house track where woodblocks hand drums shakers and bass notes spin around each other in fluidly choreographed routines though that track and the serene a-side have firm kick drums their transportive atmospheres make the most impact

ased in london but run by two frenchmen the three year-old m tis recordings imprint is releasing some pretty interesting stuff at the moment most recently there were two tuneful records by najem sworb and one last december from ritish duo though they have few releases thus far pgrs sound is a familiar one mixing live-sounding instrumentation and synths in a similar manner to 20:20 soundsystem or more recently of norway the groups material also proves useful for remixing on m tis 008 manchester artist the countach is up first reworking the slippery drum-kit-heavy groover his principal changes involve sharpening some of the hazier edges and attaching a thrumming low end the latter moves patiently through a number of pitches holding each for a while before moving on abruptly the result is a kind of e m/electro hybrid with the originals heavy-handed drum fills and rattling bleeps remaining gain the structure is very song-like seemingly begging for the addition of liaisons dangereuses or nitzer ebb-style vocals label boss catalepsia provides the second remix this time revisiting his version toughens up the wandering original introducing a powerful tribalistic beat melodically its also much more assertive gluing pitch-bending plucks and eerie wails all over the place s with previous tracks from m tis its far from conventional; reason enough for respect even if it doesnt quite float your boat

only time ve seen was at nicassim festival in spain a month or so after my 18th birthday while most of my friends were off watching muse on the main stage a small group of us splintered off to catch van helden closing out the weekend in the dance tent he dropped nyc at and my my my as well as big room remixes of prodigys out space and red chili peppers y way we danced non stop and when it got too hot we took our tops off and tied them around our heads that was in 007 that same year van helden released his seventh studio album ghettoblaster a record that confirmed his status as a household name in the world of electro house n the years that followed hed repeatedly break into the pop charts collaborating with dizzee rascal steve aoki and a trak as duck sauce ne were the fiery razor sharp grooves and disco samples of his 90s productions replaced by colossal basslines cheesy vocals and hands in the air pianos new van helden was totally unrecognisable from the young producer who was once the beating heart of new yorks thriving house scene given van heldens recent history s decision to call on him for their series seemed at first glance a risky move van helden doesnt have the lasting legacy of other artists in the series such as david rodigan gilles peterson or rew weatherall ut this mix asks us to forget the last 15 years of van heldens career starting at in at the turn of the 90s it explores two contrasting styles that had a profound impact on van helden growing up: american pop and freestyle t was at first on the dance floor and then in the booth that van helden discovered his love for this new funky club music and theres not a moment on when that passion doesnt burst through of the scenes big dogs get a shout out (except van helden himself) from on the opening cut to masters mk and ut its ( ) and ( ) who provide the standout cuts given its recent resurgence you might think another classic us house mix is the last thing you need in your life but thisll remind you why its forever hailed as one of dance musics golden eras f disc one delivers the goods exactly to order disc two is the mixs curveball n a homage to his parents record collection avh presents an hour of soft rock from the 70s and 80s ranging from the catchy to the downright soppy re are a couple of guilty pleasures but for every track theres s a route 66 power ballad of the type you assumed existed but hoped never to hear third disc positions itself somewhere between the other two homing in on freestyle a short lived electro funk sound that emerged from the us in the 80s mix gets off to a thrilling start all frenetic brightly coloured beats and lovelorn vocals but occasionally errs on the wrong side of cheesy a late outing for s f though is one of the highlights of the package as saccharine as it is in places is the best thing avh has put his name to since 1999s future4u lp that might not sound like much of an accolade given the direction he took since then but these three discs offer an insight into the musical memory of one of house musics most important figures

s new names continue to sprout from fertile music scene of los ngeles question must be asked: how much more 8-bit experimental hip-hop do we need debut album from a member of wedidit collective alongside shlohmo seems to think answer is at least one more full-length truth be told im finding it hard to disagree st s apart because of an unusual penchant fleshed-out songwriting where last record that did this sound well dibiases machines hate me was more like a restless beat tape of inspired melodies navigates songs instead of hurried two minute run-throughs absolutely nails classical- -dummies beauty of early japanese rpgs by composers like nobuo uematsu koichi sugiyama spirals out with teases of ubiquitous fantasy prelude mes album has suitably heroic overtures in which employ reverb to streng n synths into pseudo-orchestral gr eur kind of stuff that goes as nicely with timelapse photography of flowers blooming as it does with watching our hero traverse vast fields fighting assorted monsters beyond all stately pomp circumstance isnt afraid to humanize tinny machines nor does he get his ostensible hip-hop roots albums clear st out is which has vocalist weary hanging above halftime beat be e falling down lazily over regal chords luminous shimmers (a bonus disco remix of from clive signals just how far s pregnant musical ideas could be taken) our heros journey isnt without some barriers however: rapping turn from jon wayne on feels hopelessly awkward some tracks ( ) never quite scratch beyond surface of video game imitation impossibly straddles both sides of divide: his eponymous debut album succeeds both because its a committed chiptune album because of airship flights it takes away from such restrictive origins when se songs turn from 8-bit symphonies to full-fledged hip-hop effect is rarely less than spectacular mainly because transition sounds so natural while in end its still a chiptune album thus your mileage may vary over fifty minutes of stuff has enough personality compositional talent to bring it above mere stylstic exercise
if title to danilo plessows last 12-inch as ( raw cuts ) was key to unlocking its sound before putting needle to wax look no fur r than label name on this one four roses implies a bit of cultivation a bit of beauty a bit of forethought whereas both raw cuts were exercises in immediate joy of cutting up soul samples and are nothing if not composed pieces of detroit-inflected techno is more immediate of pair pushing a pounding kick throughout while a five-note riff pulses incessantly away plessow garnishes but not liberally instead opting to go dj tool route the elements are simple but rewards are high as it does nearly all work you might ask of it gradually building to an unbearable buzz and n fading away slowly carl craig-like into distance s german-crafted deep detroit techno goes plessow may not be at stoned utopilot territory yet but give him a few years and he may drop something just as massive goes slower and deeper burying quite possibly longest sustained chord of year underneath clippity-clop percussion and various vocal samples its busier than cassys work but shes a solid point of comparison: plessow loves human voice and uses here as rhythmic device just as much as kick warming up crowd you could do worse

certain words turn up often in descriptions of dub techno: deep aquatic oceanic water seems to be the styles natural reference point perhaps because of its rippling textures and tendency to distort space jacob longs music as invites different adjectives on the second track on his latest album the luminous sonorities and ping-pong delays of the basic channel school are avoided in favour of a more inert sombre sound its swung drums are placed front and centre but the weathered chord textures behind them seem unmoved by their propulsive energy stead of sending out concentric ripples into the sonic space around it the percussion seems to be hitting against a solid deadening surface: more earth than sea if you like on parts of this sound proves frustrating album was influenced by urban spaces after dark and there is a sense of distance to it as if were observing intimacy from outside a living room window heavy textures can feel oppressive and the mood tranquility with a solemn ground hum unwelcoming even the albums most dynamic track doesnt stay that way for long through trudging repetition its techno pulse slowly leaks energy into the glimmering ambience around it longs drum programming in general lacks finesse it has neither the rhythmic spark to make bodies move nor the sculpted precision for a mind-expanding armchair experience sometimes this isnt a problem the gorgeous for instance hits an emotive sweet spot with its delicate hi-hat patterns and vague swirls of melody but the musics weathered charm is more obvious when long ditches percussion altogether focussing on serene minor-key loops of smeared pads and distant hiss and which bookend the album give the impression of putting your ear to the ground to listen in on geological processes: stately mysterious incomprehensibly slow this is the level on which succeeds as a hint of things not quite grasped tantalising shapes moving beneath its earthy surfaces
as a title sounds provisional an in-progress file name that was never swapped out for the proper one the content of s latest ep fits such an interpretation in spite of his rising profile ed russells music is sounding rawer and more spontaneous than ever; fortunately its an approach that suits him the title track with its clattering snares is a sort of partner piece to russells recent remix of percs take your body off like that and the latter half of his previous r s single nancys pantry its melding of hardcore and loose-swinging techno recalls shed though russell is increasingly making the style his own elsewhere things become increasingly gummed up suggesting that a busted mixer or cheap tape deck may lurk in russells studio but what these tracks lose in clarity and punch they make up for in strength of ideas is burly-as-fuck electro mostly content to thunder along cuffing you about the eardrums with a snare every other beat punctuation comes from what sounds like a shredded old-school electro sample; just as with his jungle hybrids its as if russell is pulling apart his chosen form and making crazy paving out of the pieces cmon meanwhile aims for a stop-start shockout factor its sputtering synth riff recalls mumdance pinchs turbo mitzi while the latter halfs jarred chords suggest a made up sound at his wildest its probably too disjointed for club use but we can happily marvel at its outr qualities from the comfort of our office chairs
is really proving to be one of the most talented producers to come out from the scandinavian region in quite a while and with this new he looks set to add to his always growing reputation first up on the a-side is the mingle king and it doesn t waste any time in getting this ep into gear it is quite a driving progressive cut with a solid electro groove flowing nicely with some solid drums and storming electro riff and a driving baseline that keeps it moving at solid pace great way to kick things off following this is crazy menu and with this production the tempo drops somewhat the track though is still quite sinister thanks to a gritty baseline and some nice atmospheric pads deep into the track pitched up this track is quite a dirty 3am moment the title track in sleepless in stockholm is first up on the b-side and again ozgur delivers quite a driving progressive tech cut this time the baselines are again driving and sinister and combined with the intricate drums as well as the twisted synth patterns this production again is a peak time masterpiece for ozgur simplicity closes the ep off in a smooth and somewhat downtempo style compared to the other productions smooth warm pads roll alongside some subtle and delicate percussion and a nice bouncy b-line a very solid release here from ozgur showcasing the sounds that he is all about at the moment

going on his own for the time being tone depth enlists the vocal cords of matt shapiro in hopes to create a new sound for himself with the original mix retains the essence of tone depth musical style; deep flowing bass lines with subtitle melodies and a pinch of tribal rhythms for an added flare gone are the sensual guitar stings though most people who have followed his career with studio partner soul tan will hear a new direction for this release arrangements more in line to fit shapiro s lyrics the production is built to envelope around shapiro instead of playing in the background a bit strange though as all shapiro is there for is just two lines for the whole time as you would have assumed his presence would be felt more than what it is the club mix is near identical to the original mix with heavier emphasis on the bass lines and a slight alteration to shapiro s vocals at the break most if not everyone will not hear a difference between the two though the bass line works much better in the club mix than the original mix it still doesn t justify having two mixes that are near identical in this day in age on vinyl i may be wrong maybe i need to hear this on a quality club sound system to understand the difference but from what i hear now you have to wonder why didn t add at least one of the digital mixes for along with the vinyl to give the release some added depth tone depth has always made music that creates a certain mood moody and sensual has always been his bread and butter however in search to distinguish himself away from soul tan and stephanie vezina he doesn t find the mark he s looking for

keiren lomax and laurence osbourne return to aus with two collaborative efforts on this fine ep of angular but catchy house music opens with jutting synths before bubbling up into a thick percussive stew where cowbells reverberate and a lovely fluid bassline flows its gritty and muscular without overdoing it is a heavy hitting slice of robotic soul that has hints of the duos past dalliances in dubstep with a satisfying crispness to its bass/kick combo then the duo take turns flying solo lomax plays it deep and melancholic on snares and hi hats seemingly dragging a bpm or so behind a standard house tempo then he flicks the switch and in rushes shimmering cymbals and a squawk that sounds like a steel drum being hit with scouring pads instantly taking it somewhere deeper osbournes contribution places a simple but gigantic bass riff at its center around which he hangs peak time scuba style synths dabs of acid and a trippy sparkly synth it draws the curtain across a wonderfully balanced ep

following the very brilliant pat foosheen release aussie label eq grey turn up the heat with the latest release from accorsi bassetti entitled until the end it featured on the latest global underground release from deep dish and for good reason as it is a solid release from the us boys the original mix is on the a-side and it begins with some stuttering tribal drums alongside a heavy kick drum the track soon builds with some subtle effects coming into play alongside a very subtle vocal sample the baseline enters soon enough and it gives the production more drive as do the nice melodic effects that soon gain in strength the track breaksdown midway and sees sounds and melodies filter through the air the beats are soon re-introduced as the track then builds down with the baseline playing a major role on the flip is the long flight mix this mix takes a more minimal approach as the major focus is put on the percussion side of things the arrangement is quite similar however the focus on sounds and atmosphere is somewhat lost in this remix the vocal gives the track a nice eerie feel throughout though which works quite well another stellar release from eq and with releases such as scrambler s free including a killer lo step remix to follow the label seems to be in tip top shape
prins has two labels one is full pupp reserved solely for fellow norwegians and the other is for all the rest ive never really been sure of the need to make nationalistic divisions as the musical output on both is by and large analogous but whatever the reason the latter makes good on its presumed mission statement: america canada britain germany italy and ireland have all been represented at some point or another in the labels three years of existence now its the turn of japan by way of the relatively unknown to stake a claim to the cosmic canon its not hard to see what the norwegian finds appealing about the duo the material is as space-weathered as his own constant usage of vague celestialisms to describe this particular scene can grow rather tiresome but when the patiently built plane of shooting stabs and orbiting arpeggios on is finally shattered into a luminous supernova its difficult to avoid them in more earthly terms its all about the break prins clearly agrees and in his laconic remix he dispenses almost entirely with elements of the build (indeed with percussion too) and grants the musical bang an extended encore yellobirds opts for groove over transcendence the riff is funky and its good to hear a native signature in the gently tapped oriental-style melody but tbds stomping remix grabs most of the attention lee douglas and justin vandervolgen currently seem hell-bent on their quest for the big-room and the peaktime and in their high-octane sonic whirlwind its just as easy to lose yourself as on that bursting star
there are not many artists who can combine complexity with emotional warmth like the chilean production supremo can her latest offering for is a compact affair but maintains the standards she set with her recent time to lose it ep for visionquest is the deeper techier cut of the brace on offer there are elements of jam spoons classic stella on show here with a pulsing wobbly low-end oscillation underpinning the understated cotton-soft percussion and snatches of s own alearic-style vocal switch to -side for a more dance floor-oriented housier offering on the surface it appears to all be about driving energy with frazzled synths frantically bouncing between left and right speakers ut theres a soft underbelly on display via verdant analogue synths that tom middleton would be proud of this is the sound of an artist really hitting their straps
no bass no kick no problem frequent trapez contributor patrice b umel seems to have been patiently waiting to make his big move over the past few years releasing a steady stream of tasteful inventive tech-house stompers and garnering a fair amount of praise along the way he held a successful residency at the recently closed club 11 in msterdam was commissioned by dirt crew and riley reinhold for some well-received remixes and otherwise held on to the reins of an upwardly arching techno career who could have guessed that a dj tool would put his name in the running for breakthrough artist of the year perhaps its not entirely fair to call the a tool sure it hasnt a kick drum to speak of but with a running time of six-plus minutes it twists and turns as much as any track out there nd as evidenced by its use in onur zers watergate 01 mix it can and should be allowed several minutes alone to do its thing to most that might seem like an awfully long time to lounge around in the midrange just to provide a gentle reminder of what exactly that four-on-the-floor is doing for them but what makes this break so palatable is well the roar the tracks namesake is actually something more akin to a chainsaw or lawnmower being revved to the brink of mechanical seizure only to be released at the last possible second the well-deserved rest that comes at regular intervals barely keeps all of the cogs and teeth of the machinerys guts and for that matter the delicate minds of a peaking crowd intact midst all this mis-engineering are hearty hungry-man workforce claps pressure valve bellows and a whole lot of delay if all of this is starting to sound uninviting then youre missing the point; this kick-less wonder could be s most convincing reminder that all of this minimal-not-minimal-detroit-is-king-laptops-are-evil-vinyl-is-heavy nonsense was at one time supposed to be all about having fun on the flip are two solid examples of b umels more typical fare shows off his ability to depict vertical movement with its invariably ascending and descending melodies often traveling in opposite directions at wildly differing intervals closing things out is which follows a similar agenda but with the heart-tug turned way up especially once the longing bassline is accompanied by a cinematic string section to bring the cows home or perhaps set the weary sun
if youre after a trio of chuggers to pick up enjoy and then completely forget about not all that far down the line you could do a hell of a lot worse than the debut ep from young austrian producer not that their relative disposability is necessarily a drawback merely a statement of fact; there are simply too many records of this ilk around to dwell on these particular ones for all that long admittedly the probably deserves a little more praise than this its insistent drums give it more urgency than your average deep house effort res also a lovely melodic organ that slowly moves its way up in the mix but its almost a little subtle for its own good like the pretty shy friend who hides at the back of a group photo and is as such not quite strong enough to carry the rest of the ep male vocal that features on all three tracks is fine in pitch and tone and one could imagine if it were cut loose that it could really do some damage but its instead restricted to uninspiring utterances along the lines of i want you to move it which really doesnt benefit anyone when appearing in this kind of setting re are some nice ideas here you just cant help wish that feynman had explored them a bit further
its usually a safe bet to call a 14-minute techno bomb beastly but skateb rds larger-than-life single originally released last summer is a little too cuddly to truly fit the bill sure the norwegian veteran has given his snarling bassline an enormous habitat to stalk through and it bears its teeth as it modulates over its extended runtime yet skateb rd has unleashed a gentle giant a creature whose pitch-black hues and comic proportions make it more immersive than imposing the tracks digital re-release comes with remixes from a trio of fellow scandinavians given s relatively pared-down arrangement all three reworks feel like expansions even if theyre considerably less epic in scale chmmrs remiks puts a little pep in its step with some extra sizzle on the percussion and skateb rds bassline distilled to a single nervy note telephones takes nearly the opposite approach sidestepping the originals darkness in favor of dense disco jamming finnish band jesse stays closest to skateb rds original vision though their looser arrangement improbably lends an urgency it had lacked before

over the past few years real name joe seaton has hopscotched between functional and experimental productions while last years migrant ep for featured relatively straight-ahead tracks with spacy dub underpinnings his most recent record as ondo fudd followed the spiritual-jazz-meets-ambient style of cuts like sulu sekou from his 2014 debut lp suzi ecto his two eps as this year nervous sex traffic for dekmantel and now for aim at a happy medium mixing high-minded production concepts with beats that beckon towards the club the opener is a sparse ominous roller whose creaking sound effects and somber synths set the stage for a show-stopping bassline a loping figure that could have been lifted from a dub reggae record with its arrival the track lands in a meditative zone combining the head-nodding heft of early dmz releases with an earthier on-u sound aesthetic on the surface is more conventional it begins with a tom-heavy house beat the whole thing teeming with birdsong and rainforest rustling up in the canopy bells and whistles join an optimistic orchestral drone the mid-range undergrowth contains plaintive piano leads accompanied by idm-style synth chirps and subtle percussion underneath it all the insistent beat is the river running through this bizarre ecosystem the track brings the previously divergent strands of seatons music into an intriguing head-spinning whole
a combination of praslea and raresh take the reins for the second release on and if youre looking for a frame of reference those two names will point you in the right direction [a:rpia:r]/romanian microhouse/limited vinyl-only yep yep and yep this is the first production raresh has been involved with since 2007 and it looks like he has learned his lesson; his last track dry tool rather generously sampled a thomas brinkman production without an accompanying credit here the sample used is acknowledged rightly so too as bits is a club-friendly reworking of megablasts ufo in brazil minimal roller by nature the eleven-and-a-half minute effort doesnt seem to change much but rather relies on intricate percussion and recurring vocal echoes to keep things going on the other side we find and mbitime two tracks built out of the same elements mbitime comes across a little half-baked; the ideas and sounds are good but the composition and arrangement leave a lot to be desired things pick up on opening with crisp drums and reverb-heavy synth washes the clicky offbeat kick lures the listener into a false sense of security for a whole three minutes before its bigger fatter brother comes in and makes his 4/4 point the cymbals intensify a piano stabs wildly in the dark and before you know it the whole thing has subsided back into its wobbly rhythm
the next release from the californian based heading home recordings comes from a belgian based production outfit by the name of the trio has had releases on labels such as wally s groove world grayhound and outergaze just to name a few and have been praised by artists such as kenny hawkes and laurent garner this latest release sees the outfit deliver two more original productions with their distinct house grooves first up is i surrender and it begins with a nice arrangement of melodic keys that build the track up early alongside some nice hi hats and snares a very deep and chunky baseline soon enters the track and is shortly followed by a nice crisp kick drum that really kick starts the production to fire on all cylinders the track takes a nice big breakdown midway in and again kicks into gear with the melodic effects really hit peak time wheel of fortune is on the flip is definitely on the funky tip compared to the more peak time a-side building horns alongside some latin style beats and funky baselines give this track a classic house feel this is another pretty good release from a label that continually impresses in bringing good diversity to its release

in february released their much-praised second album reassemblage by releasing another full-length this year spencer doran and ryan carlile have proven themselves to be tireless explorers the music here is the result of feeding several dialects and accents through language translation software ( the idea was to create a projected language that was a fusion of many says doran ) these voices which as angus finlayson has noted are central to their work provide structure however elusive to their ambient drifts as esoteric as the use of language translation software might seem doran and carlile work their magic on these dialects and accents of the first five tracks only the first tops three minutes opens with a flurry of voices as if emanating from a bank of televisions all tuned to different channels before an elegant ripple of electronics slows things to a stately pace a southern american twang can be heard on moves from a stern synthetic voice that recalls a german accent before it slips into something less clear plonks of mallets arise they underpin dorans fairlights mallets bamboo mixes as does an ethereal ambient passage which ends far too soon the 14-minute is the core of an extended piece that brings to mind the side-long track escape music from city to paradise from their 2015 debut just as s first half seems to blur past theres an immersive aspect to watery sounds slosh around airy tones drift at the periphery and chords ripple outwards its not easy to remember just what happens here nor does it build to a discernible peak but when it begins to fade away you feel slightly disappointed to be guided out of that world and back into this one
swedish housecat mikael nordgren has made no small amount of tasteful stripped-down tracks most notably under his moniker sporting light disco and electro influences many of his outings seem a little too close to the minimal party line to really evoke much of a response the exception so far has been 2007s voyage which took all that well-sculpted space and added something beautiful to it namely an arching cosmic lead the results may have been a little bit closer to classic trance for some but the drums and synth washes retained enough physicality to keep things from getting on the wrong side of pretty marks the third release for get physical and while it doesnt hit the high points of some of his other outings its certainly his strongest effort for gpm the title track is a dark chilly number with a solid shuffling beat that peeks open to reveal a percolating lead and a clipped vocal sample reminiscent in some ways of ts breakout track hooked when the simple uplifting key pulse kicks in youve got a solid mover that wont make anybodys night but could certainly liven up a mundane hard-house set flipside starts well with wooden percussion and a great blurty keyboard motif that recalls a messed-up organ set on stun more promising still is the threatening echoed-out synth that hovers ominously moving from deep in the mix to lurch and linger as we pass the midpoint sadly it seems like this is exactly the point at which loses its momentum s with much of material the stage is set and the costumes are lovely but none of the actors ever gain the confidence to burst into a crowd-wooing monologue t might be chic to keep ones sounds scrupulously groomed and hidden from the bright stage-light but letting go and reveling in them is what could elevate nordgrens material out of the realm of the merely well-behaved
if there has been one consistent criticism of s work its that its derivative part of that post-dubstep generation who arrived when uk producers were fusing house two-step and techno have struggled to mint a distinctive sound instead the trios back-catalogue has swung from the 90s hardcore-referencing ruk to the garage-tinged retro house of neon in a way that for all their clear talent has tended to sound fashionable rather than fresh given that context is a bizarre debut album it ignores the prevailing trends of londons club scene but only to create a record that sounds like a calculated replication of the established monkeytown and 50 weapons sound the widescreen breakbeat-driven opener is pure moderat while could easily be phon o the freezing fog atmospheres of and are similarly reminiscent of moderat ii just as the hi-hats worming bass and organ stabs of evoke phon os black boulder cornelias vocals half dillon half portisheads beth gibbons are hardly a significant point of differentiation nor is the soul vibe that unexpected guest vocalist dbridge brings to very little of this is truly bad (the hackneyed closer being one exception) and occasionally flash us a brilliant idea cleverly morphs from reedy krautrock into a carnival track whose pulsating sub-bass seems to physically move the air in the room but even that could be a new modeselektor track as could the pitch-bending rhythmically swinging this points to the main problem with where are its challenges or surprises where is the sense of as an individual musical entity listening to is like pulling on a old pair of trainers: comfortable familiar and ultimately rather boring
the reviews of each new release are starting to sound as similar as the records themselves they comment on the labels rapid-fire release schedule and note the swedish duos signature combination of disco sounds and meaty house beats it feels like there really is a machine that chews up disco loops and spits them back out with a dense percussive framework and a dusty mixdown the third 12-inch so far this year opens with another sunny house roller with a healthy dose of disco instrumentation at first it all sounds a bit murky a slightly blunted kick churns through hand drums and indistinct chatter but the drums get stiffer when a searing hi-hat enters the mix and a theatrical string melody starts up karlssons ditches the disco melody in favor of a rollicking bassline a few vocal snippets and the occasional piano stab all in all theres nothing particularly offensive here but nothing particularly striking either just another solid two-tracker from the machine
haydar lacognata are two experienced dj s and producers from argentina and they team up here on the imprint to deliver their first up on the a-side is dark melody and pretty much like the name the track flows quite nicely throughout with some dark beats achieved through crisp beats deep and dark baselines as well as some quirky and eerie effects as the track progresses a deep and somewhat analogue melodic line comes into the track to give it an intensified eeriness it definitely is one of the finer deep progressive cuts i have heard lately on the flip is paradise clear a track that is not as quirky and eerie as the a-side but is somewhat soothing and deep instead smooth baselines interact with swirling effects and sounds as well as some smooth flowing beats a pretty good release here from the south american producers with both sides doing nice things the a-side though is quite unique and is sure to please with quirky edge
theres a forgotten classicism to the music that makes up s next release on his own not only are the arrangements grandiose and sweeping but the instruments sound real and played it makes for music that somehow feels more important and enduring than your average throwaway track and in the process sends your mind in a spin trying to tie up the appropriate mental images for such widescreen non standard sounds: cinematic perhaps gets the package underway with lacerated sounding snares skating around the mix from left to right heavyhearted chords slowly move up and down the scale to bring a little warmth and only at about the midpoint do the kicks grow loud enough for you to realise youre actually listening to techno the first of two killer remixes comes from kirk who skews the chords into more urgent patterns as other synth lines squiggle about in the background conjuring a feeling of flying through a starlit sky at 100 miles an hour ambient expert john beltran is the other remixer his version is dense with strings and blotchy melodies staying slightly more bogged down in the drums this one feels glazed over with a chilly winter frost mustafa closes things out with a restless jostling drum arrangement with mournful melodic sweeps that dart about like a bee in a box intense and heady without ever feeling overpowering it makes for arresting listening
prolific russian alexey devyanin is best known for his pixelord project which produced an album places earlier this year that lp neatly summarised devyanins style of melodious electronica which skips deftly between styles without putting deep roots into any for its followup devyanin pulls another name from his grab bag of aliases: a home for muzzy house music the cccp ep takes its inspiration from soviet social and science films animations and cassette tapes from an era long gone its deliciously nocturnal and vague music shot through with nostalgia though it still has a sugary zing common to most of devyanins music the eps six tracks work with a limited palette: tumbledown house grooves warbly pads tape hiss on opener ccp and itsnotaboutcomputers paternalistic russian voices call to mind an earlier age of broadcasting devynanin paints his world convincingly but as ever with light brushstrokes tracks tend to be bite-sized and their most surprising moments are often glossed over ( downloading s frantic breakdown is considerably more interesting than the torpid track it interrupts) things become more compelling as devyanin nears the edges of his chosen territory make_me_juice sways with the menace of dark garage; closer virtual is stiff-limbed dub at the opening but loosens up as it goes
xx compilation successfully avoided what ras christine kakaire calls dewy-eyed retrospectives choosing instead to celebrate the labels first 20 years with collaborations remixes and new material while kakaires imagination was sparked by spin-the-bottle hook-ups between established acts relative newcomers to the imprint provided the best glimpse of its future brightest of its great white hopes are emika and each of whom have dragged dubstep backwards through ninjas sound collage aesthetic to arrive at their own voices: hers cold dark and minimal; his warm vibrant and lush san francisco-based s debut album opens with xx standout which frames everything that follows shuffling beats thud and crackle over deep purring bass lit up by saucer-eyed synths and dreamy vocals incanting floating and floating and floating in light an artist who has spent a decade developing a genre-less approach (dubstep is a darts-throw approximation) brendan angelides production as can be pinned down somewhere between the intense assemblage of labelmate and collaborator amon bin and j dillas slow funk having refined his sound through releases on planet mu and warp has chosen to mark out his artist album with extensive use of his own vocals this sets him apart from the pack of faceless producers but the continual drone of his moby-esque mumbles can grate especially with lyrics that do little more than emphasise what each track and its title already communicate: as such the albums highlights are those that use angelides voice sparingly (the short sweet head-trip ) or not at all ( with its frozen eastern electronics) where the expressive music is allowed to speak for itself having found his voice both literally and as a producer angelides needs to ensure his longevity by finding something to say and someone else to say it for him while his female flipside emika seems to have no end of angst to tap into the only track to reach beyond stargazer poetry is lands and bones a warp-issued collaboration with singer-songwriter swan palermo visionary producers like jackson and his computer band and indeed amon bin have found room for other (bits of) voices in their sonic universes; should learn to do the same

is no fool he knows that you dont have the time or even the energy to listen to his fourth album in one go but rather than bemoan how we listen to music in hes gone ahead and done something about it is a quick 50 minutes just long enough to soundtrack your commute to work (or in the case of a fellow traveling dj the airport ) seven minute dance floor-oriented tracks are for the club four of the nine songs here dont even break five minutes s a utilitarian move but its also one that responds to reality do you play when youre making dinner slugabed results in bloody onions and caretaker makes you question the value of eating altogether before s mid-paced melodic techno is just right this isnt to say that the album isnt worth a close listen fter all the attention of costellos imagined commuter is undivided suffused with costellos distinctive and warm melodies crafted here via the 101 prophet 5 synclavier its almost bursting with emotion irish producers work since he founded his look long imprint last year has followed the same path as much of what youll find on before focusing itself as much on trying to make you feel as it is with trying to make you move your feet in 12-inch format this can often be an almost futile endeavor ( only need one track for the end of the night nnacha thank you ) s part of a full-length its a welcome change of pace despite the intense amount of care thats gone into making before as coherent a full-length as possible it also serves as its greatest weakness costello obviously takes great pleasure in finding a new way to present the synclavier but 50 minutes of the same synthesizers used to (largely) the same ends is just as wearying as 50 minutes of go-nowhere-minimal-bongo-house re are moments that should signal respite: three minute ambient interludes like or which bookend the majestic ambient techno of for instance but the only thing separating their timbre is a four-four beat re is no respite here from the melancholy or for that matter the tools that costello uses to achieve it sustained mood pieces are lovely to sink into depressive techno heads lonely commuters gear heads and many more will find plenty to love s an album however is too emotionally one-note to rise above its status as pretty good into essential territory leaving listeners better off to pick their favorites exactly the opposite of what costello likely had in mind
nother year another dubplate finally pressed to wax its a ritual that mala and coki have been slowly and patiently engaging in drawing on a seemingly endless pool of tunes from their peak era (or at least malas) credited to and not their solo aliases as usual its plain as day which producer is responsible for each side s far as mala tunes go is on the frantic side the elements disheveled when theyre usually perfectly balanced he layers and twists a dancehall vocal over discordant horn stabs and stressful synths for a nightmare dub thats a lot more chaotic than were accustomed to still its gracefully contained in a way that only mala can do and years of exposure hasnt dulled its unique edge cokis flipside is a little more restrained than his usual wobble-thrash take on the genre which appears to be a newer track does away with the nails-and-chalkboard sound of his newer work and instead beefs up its midrange joker-style with all the requisite psychedelic sounds both sides are planted firmly in roots dubstep and as far as tracks go theyre top shelf
youd be hard pressed to better encapsulate the reductionist house and techno movement of the mid 00s than via s 2006 mix shes a dancing machine scattershot synthesis darkened pads drums so tight they squeaked; the release brooded with a kind of robot driven potency that was equal parts machine and groove it felt like an aural slap to the face: this is here and now so naturally the question mark surrounding s mix for the evergreen fabric series is whether she would attain those previously scaled heights and perhaps just as importantly how her innate sonic persuasion would come over in a much altered electronic music landscape on absorbing fabric 49 what becomes abundantly clear is that is once again taking aim at your hips sure shell use a burst of static instead of a bongo or a tremulous pitch bent synth in place of a major 7th chord but much like the innumerable proponents of the current deep house escapade her primary objective stems from establishing a groove and burrowing into it and also similarly to its predecessor fabric 49 sees take a patchwork approach to its construction by layering as many as three tracks to create a singular whole outwardly non conventional meetings between and ; and ; and all fare remarkably well in their own right but things become a lot less clear when unreleased material from bootsy and bleeds into tracks from the minus stable its best then to think of such compositions in terms of their presented whole rather than attempting to pick apart its component pieces which is presumably what would have intended anyway if youre one for overarching atmospheric themes in this case i would offer you dank cuts like and hearthrobs union do poke their heads above the fog but all too often things become weighted down in a sort of turbid minimal soup and s huddle followed by a double header between and threatens to take the mix down a cul de sac named bleep street but for every overly robotic passage a period of respite rescues your attention case in point the next number which marries s post disco esque with s boisterous to considerable effect said fabric 49 often feels a little like sitting in one of those japanese sushi go round restaurants; and by the time and arrive on the carousel for the final offering you cant help but wish more of the dishes were equally as satisfying its difficult not to evaluate s efforts against a backdrop that has changed drastically since 2006 many of the themes from three years ago present themselves again here but of course with the passage of time comes ennui if youre the type of listener who likes their groove based club music sculpted at the minimal school of sound design then youre unlikely to find a more exciting mix this year however the issue for those from outside the bracket is that the intrinsic qualities that made shes a dancing machine so essential back then dont feel half as vital right now
the tracks alejandro ghersi makes as rarely cohere to normal ideas of structure or rhythm his early stretch releases for uno made the human voice sound malleable and sickly then of course came kanye wests yeezus where ghersi could be heard in the evil warped snarl of tracks like im in it and send it up and his equally challenging work with fka twigs the squirming electronics of the 25-minute felt like a response to all the attention that yeezus kicked up and takes a similarly erratic path the album is named after ghersis alter-ego: is not really a boy and its not really a girl and her mere existence is kind of repulsive and attractive at once he recently told fader its that contrast of beauty and ugliness that ghersi explores over these contorting confusing 40 minutes nothing about the way ghersi tackles sound is traditional consider that which is essentially a trip-hop track sticks out on simply because of how normal it sounds this is an elusive record thats surprising almost every time you listen to it ghersis butterfingers style of songwriting is both fascinating and frustrating its clear that hes in full control at all times but he makes otherwise beautiful songs like and feel volatile these two have baroque classical touches that come out in frantic spurts and their titles reflect an emotional undercurrent that comes and goes as quickly as any other element of the album theres also thug which seems to poke fun at the sad-boy persona of modern hip-hop with its immaculately hurt synths and perfectly booming drum pattern but even that ones not as simple as it looks: its based on a fantasy character of ghersis who is both eroticized and ridiculed thats the thing about this music its always more complex than it sounds ghersis most alluring quality has always been his slipperiness after all is a tale of fluidity and self-discovery and just as any one person can transcend identities forced on her by others so can music the result is an album thats never quite what you want it to be nor for that matter is it any one thing for more than a few minutes a noted producer for some incredibly influential artists (with bj rk next on the list) has expectations placed on him that would terrify most artists his age (24 at the time of writing) wouldnt know it from however which remains as singular and often as brilliant as the rest of the catalogue

daniel martin-mccormicks already established himself as a ubiquitous presence on the experimental music scene from his spot in defunct dc hardcore band black eyes throaty disco-punkers mi ami or with the weirdo glam of sex worker martin-mccormicks seemingly already made a virtual tour of musical niches nooks and crannies beginning last year though martin-mccormick began releasing long unspooling fx-laden house as with two of the years more prominent singles in s theme on scene-defining boutique sub 100 silk and culture clubs on rs rock reconfigured himself anew as one of the more intriguing sonic craftsmen in the lamely-tagged hipster house scene theres been a rough low-spun quality to s detour laden creations one that somehow sounds patently contemporary and ever-indebted to classical house and 40+ years of experimental electronic getaways hes got a sly way with melody; his tracks always feel highly elastic elongated almost to the point of a-recognition like theyve been stretched and drawn out until they reveal themselves only several minutes in his debut lp follows in the vein of s theme by focusing on warm softly throbbing textural slides over insistent 4/4 rhythms to forge a kind of day-drifted vagabond music akin to the work of acts like blondes or the miracles club from the moment the choppy stumble-drunk funk of doesnt begins fronted by samples of both lady gaga and whitney houston martin-mccormick stages his brand of strident strobe-burst expansionism with its slow warbling intro sounds like the sun-deadened soundtrack to one of jg ballards vermilion sands stories with its 4/4 rhythms slowly forcing the wavering synth lines beyond their dazed circling while is deeper headier its horizon-wide synth swaths leading the way across soft clicks and radiant chords meanwhile undercuts tubby bass and its choppy beat with samples that sound like the erratic error-prone bells of a train-track crossing stitched into song before another of martin-mccormicks colorful synth washes overrides it all as closer final enters with the sound of washed-out strings and its deep house stroll from the surface arguably the most traditional moment on the entire record you can hear martin-mccormick tugging at its classical foundations filtering in new noises and folding back others tinkering with fx and leaving the listener uncertain of his footing in a way that recalls some of the more feverish work of theo parrish its deeply satisfying both as a home head-nodder and a floor-rush and a creation thats likely to draw far more fans to s work than the beardo beats crowd the blogospheres worked so hard to associate him with
the last we heard from hunter p thompson aka portlands was his vague response cassette which came out almost a year ago on 100 silk the tape wasnt the first time hed produced this hazy yet clubby sound (hes previously released ambient and new age as opaline) but it was the first to attract wider attention that might explain why his latest ep has emerged on which has worked with the likes of kim ann foxman robert owens and mark e where vague response featured tracks with various tempos is made up entirely of dance floor house every track is between 120 and 125 bpm which gives his trademark dreaminess a nervous energy even though it feels uniform but while the beat keeps things moving his astral synths usually reverb-soaked and either arpeggiated into melodic riffs or drifting like drone clouds make you float this is especially true of the opener elsewhere subtle touches like the syncopated claps of and the percussion ripples of are head-turning details s best quality is his musics consistent vibe and transportive energy his tracks have a beatific calming and sensual atmosphere with a light touch and a deep groove

it could be argued that a second remix ep of s enjoyable but hardly epoch-defining lp utomaton was over-egging things a little unlike the first set which was defined by ewan pearsons bold rework of last dance theres no major focal point here though there is enough quality to justify the release french producer nhars rework of is likely to go down best with fans of s dreamy trancey aesthetic it retains the originals sleepy feel but stretches it into a double-length ambient house epic replete with cosy beats and an ultra-atmospheric background ivan smagghe and tim pariss take on the in their its guise pushes the originals depeche mode-indebted electronic pop into a tunnel of discordant bleeps and staccato percussion remixes of and by my and nitin work similar tricks on slow and stately tracks the former adds a 4/4 drum beat a club-friendly bassline and synth and effects flourishes while the latter winds s vocal around a percussive techno base neither is groundbreaking but both do the job reasonably well
back in 2010 when s released its first earth tones various artists e ras todd l burns remarked that e s surprising highlight was its appearance from an unknown ra r than heavy hitters the third issue plays same switch up though res an appearance from here is difficult and quiet even by his standards: a kick drum buried so deep you can only feel its faint imprint obscured vocals and a jarringly bright synth sample give off impression of a track that can barely hold itself toge r its hard to imagine it doing anything o r than confusing a dance floor the highlight this time comes from whose coasts on florid breezes of strings that feel like yd burn holes through usual curtain drawn deep house of soul eople with a knotted boogie bassline keeping things from floating away relative unknown s is highly cerebral a makeshift beat that breaks off usual soul eople styles into large uneven chunks the submerged pieces are held in place by a ticking hi hat so that whole thing feels like patchwork clockwork finally levon vincent favourite s is spongiform dub techno wobbling and jiggling around a suspended beat that seems afraid to drop into a straightforward four to floor pattern the earth tones series with its third volume is a typically humble affair that shows that s talents extend to a r as well
has taken a bit of getting used to working solo both russell brothers can make awesomely characterful standalone club moments like say hackney parrot or kymin lea their tracks by comparison are level atmospheric and sometimes sketch-length they work best in sum rather than individually which might be why the projects releases have been grouped into a trilogy arla ii had the puzzles key pieces (it would be great to hear the duo experiment more with those odd time signatures) the trilogys final instalment fills the remaining gaps as with the previous eps the obvious standout is a rolling techno epic with spuming trance leads isnt the best in the style but its a satisfying slice of big-room shock and awe elsewhere the duo home in further on s trademark mood: cresting euphoria expressed via gauzy 90s signifiers its exquisite in where junglist breakbeats stutter and whirr through a teary mist of chords almost as good is a two minute hands-in-the-air breakdown without a drop only is a bit lacklustre slowing the chug to 90 bpm and turning the mood inwards giddy highs are what do best
was the first record from the turkish supergroup originally released by aboov plak in 2013 its now been reissued by honest jons backed with two remixes from ricardo recorded live at mini m zikhol (a venue run by group member mini bashekim) kimi ( so what ) unites elements of acid house and turkish folk music reaching beyond the two traditions while staying true to each the song comes from haydar haydar a poem by 17th century alevi-bektashi poet kul s m that vocalizes an internal struggle with god while traditional performances of haydar haydar carry a solemn penitent tone s version channels a sense of rebellion via acid houses otherworldly textures the result is a beautiful haunting trip that highlights houses ability to synthesize both the divine and the hedonistic it seems appropriate that an artist known for his balancing act of maintaining and losing control would remix the winding stylistically the original doesnt sit too far from s comfort zone: the vocal deliveries slightly out of tune with each other could have easily come from one of his own records while the fast-paced first mix doesnt sound dramatically different from much of s recent material his sparse arrangement lends it a psychedelic quality the second version is more subdued and its more compelling than the first as holds back his typical showmanship and focuses on the originals lamentation both remixes demonstrate a singular understanding of the originals complex spirituality
it may have taken a few years but were finally treated to some praiseworthy remixes of s classic ngel jerome sydenham and detroit native keith kemp are responsible for the updates on s young sub-label guilty pleasures and the two producers each successfully transform one of craigs finest pieces of work into something entirely fresh sydenhams treatments while relatively similar in arrangement and aesthetic repurpose craigs track to fill a big room with a big soundsystem while his uncharacteristically icy dub-techno remixes are punctuated by resonant heavy bass drums sydenhams dub maintains a hypnotizing groove much like the original chugging along nicely behind craigs sultry spoken-word vocals removing the vocals and adding a bit more drama and depth the dub employs thumping kicks and buzzing synths against a darker atmosphere his remix almost indistinguishable from the dub is a bit sparser in its percussion arrangement fans of ostgut ton will definitely enjoy these remixes as they fit squarely within the style that the label has helped define over the last few years keith kemp has a decidedly different interpretation he gives the track a rich buttery bassline and lush synths staying true to the more blissful moments of the original sydenhams restrained remixes make excellent dj tools but kemps track stands on its own and makes an impact its a fully realized idea a sophisticated remix that benefits from his meticulous production and musicianship

so how was miami for you if like me you were reduced to following diaries from the likes of ra youll greatly welcome the appearance of s annual florida party coverage theres a few biggies on here to contend with proving that theres plenty of life in the old house beast yet david piccioni presides over both cds and the first is a selection of mostly vocal house with jay js hooky keep on risin sam la mores takin hold and e-funks shout the pick of a very good bunch until bini martini show up with a funkier-than-thou bass line on the gospel flavoured say yes things begin to chill towards the close with kevin yost and the lazy dog man ben watt providing some deepness the second mix goes darker more tribal and includes planet funks snarling who said the stomping dark beat from oscar g ralph falcon and a pumping collective ep from def e my pick of this mix is the haunting shivver a david forbes and mallorca lee production meanwhile old faves plastic dreams and outta limits mission control make welcome appearances expect these tunes to be big this summer you cant go wrong with this one with over two hours of floor filling action
k daniel sling has co-run since 2011 building a dream world of off-kilter house acid and techno but only now after a collaboration with samo dj as sling samo and pushing breakout names like powder and baba stiltz do we get his first solo ep with the laidback and goofy sound that typifies the swedish scene fits nicely alongside slings curatorial choices but where lots of those records have a playful attitude (see last years parody of hollaback girl ) feels darker ep is full of twiddling melodies and rubbery basslines that operate in groggy spaces track titles are also dark first tune is thick and druggy with syrupy drums that quiver with each hit and a spoken vocal about confusion and apathy ( this is the end / but you dont even want to remain ) other two carry a quieter kind of loneliness mixing toy-like melodies into woozy grooves and foggy textures s is a moment of relief thanks to soothing rhythms and soft sounds that slip by like a pleasant dream
leave it to a record label owned by a journalist and a producer who remembers all too well the glory days the early 90s when techfunk seemed like where it was indeed at to release an homage to dj duke in a year that has seen the reissue culture electronic music reach rock music proportions though it seems appropriate no fter all was the guy that released the first -inch on the renewed r s label nd if you take a quick look at the red bull music cademy video archives theres head gerd janson chatting up dance music legends getting them to open up about how it was all better back in the day (the day when artists presumably put minute-long cuts on their -inches ) listening to slaves newest its hard to argue sounds similar in tone to his ep for r s in that it doesnt do much anything at all and does it incredibly well for more than nine minutes we get something on the order five to ten notes melody played out in synth stabs punctuated by a blast that nestles itself between the 4 and the all buoyed by an unyielding kick drum hear it at home and youll be punching your neighbor when they come to your door hear it at a club and youll be punching the air trippin is more the same although a bit more on the funky side things the riff around which the whole thing revolves is more ebullient and more rare and will fit nicely between da pitch is wild and im simeon dammit at your next warehouse party

it would be a bit much to say that flies under the radar with a career that began in the late 90s and now encompasses three albums and a few dozen singles his name is well-known still its hard to shake the feeling that the german doesnt garner quite the same amount attention as someone like jimpster who makes a similarly glossy brand deep house his latest sees a continuation this sound one which hes covered in the past for labels such as dessous and liebe*detail the title track is built around a lively piano loop and it dominates the entire duration the whole thing feels feather-light with the keys quickly lifting skyward luminous pads and strings rallying around them the breakdown these three elements later enact is superlative on the flip is a slightly stronger track here theres more complexity each elements irregular orbit interacting with the other to create something more than the sum its parts when working in concert its burnished arps sonorous bass and crunchy drums feel more like one distinct mass than several individuals its this grasp harmony which has distinguished over the years and as you might expect makes worth checking out
mythology surrounding the msterdam club and former newspaper printing press that closed for good in january is already starting to outpace reality take the sleeve of which shows the clubs circular lighting rig framed by a crucifix but strip away the hyperbole and what youre left with here is a hell of a tribute is an epic fusion of soundstream-inspired disco and a warehouse-y thump that over nearly 15-minutes ebbs and flows between glacial calm and complete delirium fter each crescendo flicking piano keys help bring down the song from the ledge bassy horn riff prefaces every peak each one higher than the last spits out its hi-hats along a bendy bassline that recalls the recent track girls hyper-rhythmic finger clicks dance precariously on the edges of the tracks churning loops this hedonistic energy carries into which is stuffed with fluttering military snares woodblock percussion and birdcalls from an aviary under siege if is a record that for embodies the spirit of the club then he was probably having an even better time there than you were
dance music as we know it today consists many varied and textured genres some are loved some are disliked while others are somewhat overlooked is one genre that evokes passion amongst many dance music aficionados either love it or you hate it but at the end the day it comes down to personal taste in the euphoric sense has always been my first love where music is concerned it evokes emotions within me that no other style has managed to do in fact i can honestly say that some tracks have reduced me to tears in the middle a dancefloor but don t get me wrong not all trance is brilliant or even good there are those tracks that have been simply created to make a quick dollar or two however a truly brilliant piece trance music will always emerge from a sea mediocrity and standout as an instant classic one such label that i feel has consistently produced such music is the beginnings are humble simon berry created and ran this label from his tiny flat in 1993 his only desire in doing so was to expose the music and artists that he loved to a wider audience platipus early releases made the label stand out immediately due to the high quality production these ferings included tracks created under simon berry s own production name but it wasn t until he heard a promo track at a club one night and signed its producer that the fortunes exploded the producer was robert miles and the track was children the rest as they say is history spurred on this initial success would eventually sign artists such as and and release such tracks as s madagascar and s calling name the release platipus squared tilt and marks platipus record s th anniversary this two cd compilation is a retrospective the label s best tracks released during this period the production levels alone makes this compilation one the best i ve heard so far this year but what makes this compilation truly stand out is that while some the tracks featured are a few years old they still sound as gorgeous as they did when they were first released these are what i consider classics and ones which will never sound aged simply put they re timeless the two cds cd 1 tilt ie parks wilson would have to lean towards a slightly progressive side trance without losing any its dancefloor appeal it opens with the original mix blue which is only a teaser the tracks that lay ahead momentum continues to build with such tracks as s melodica and s i it is this gradual build that i would refer to as the calm before the storm but it isn t until s calling name that this mix reaches its purpose and then takes you onto another level with the likes s 3 2 and then onto the final track s essence with this final track you re left with wanting more which is the perfect lead in for cd2 cd2 reveals the uplifting euphoric side trance that is missed many clubbers this is serious dancefloor material the cd opens with the beautiful all this is such a gorgeous track and every time i hear it i can t help but smile by the third track s monsoon the pace is slightly increased but not too dramatically it remains at this consistency with such tracks as s into sea s love over and s air but it s the last track that is the icing on the cake so to speak it s push s remix madagascar brilliant remix and a wonderful way to complete this outstanding compilation overall both cds were wonderfully tilt and when i first listened to platipus squared i found myself wishing it was 1998 again and i was in the middle a packed dancefloor hearing madagascar for the first time however after having listened to this continually for the last week i found myself wishing there were more clubs in sydney that played this kind trance again this is the kind music that sweeps you away and makes you forget your troubles just can t help it considering this is a reflection the best tracks released in their first years i know i m looking forward to the next and can only imagine what they will release in the future one thing for sure it will definitely be quality trance much respect
its always fascinating to see the paths taken by members successful partnerships after the duo agrees to spend some time apart dubfire went minimal sharam simply wanted to party all the time nd while dorfmeister continues to create no hassle music with tosca kruder is on a different far more interesting path which has seen him produce for dj hell as well as on his own kruders other ep visions ltd was a solid bit tech house but its nothing compared to this assured two-tracker for stefan goldmanns imprint seems to bring out the slightly quirky side artists but this is a rather conventional release utilizes pinprick synths to punch out its melody but its far from the sort atonal colors raudives earlier fering instead we simply have a probing and prodding eight minutes light and mildly funky techno to contend with which features on dixons temporary secretary mix is the clear highlight the two with its slow-building cinematics a clear ringer for the sort drama that dixon specializes in the track twinkles brass moving underneath a drawn out choir overtop in a perfect world this is what kruder dorfmeisters couldve evolved into together ut thats why partnerships break down some artists want to move forward while others are content to plow the same field over and over and over again
as skateb rd b rd aasen l demel has been producing carefree talo-inspired dance music since 00 he sticks to the same kind of synth-fueled voyages on making use of a trusty sound palette that remains fresh despite decade-old roots gooey basslines compressed drum machines and filtered chords form the records core while bell and flute sounds provide much of the melodic content with that instrumentation in tow l demel criss-crosses between spacey machine-made disco and playful house slinks just below 110 bpm with sludgy low end and layers of synth strings damour picks up the tempo as it dives into cosmic hi-nrg further down the line harkens back to classic house with its big drum samples and organ bass closer d is a moody 4 4 jaunt that brims with percussive flair and sparse glassy melodies though tracks vary in style they share much of the same dna similarities can make a bit of a slog especially when l demel lets tracks stretch on unnecessarily opener seems to arrive at a logical conclusion after six minutes but l demel inexplicably brings it back to rattle on for another three adding nothing to the mix and taking it nowhere new such indulgent runtimes make the album drag when l demel diverts from his established sound flows better songs like and lean into a sinister mood adding buzz to the synth tones and using heavier drum hits takes a brief detour into arpeggiated kosmische while standout makes a complete left turn as it rings out delay-washed guitar over a thin drum loop but even with these changes in pace ultimately lacks momentum l demel lands on some interesting ideas and has a good deal of fun with his dance floor cuts but none of it warrants the amount of fat that could have been trimmed
s little-heard escapements is a masterpiece of electronic home-listening like jean-michel jarre dundov unwittingly cracked some sort of secret code for one album jarre made new ge cheese palatable and dundov made manuel g ttsching dance its a unique trick and one that heard in isolation doesnt make a whole lot of sense thats why hearing on one side of vinyl may be great but doesn t quite equal the enormity of being surrounded by the seven other tracks on escapements that relentlessly mine the same vibe even so is the ferocious-little-tune-that-could here marrying a pounding kick drum to its modulating synth lines the focus is clearly on the power of repetition but dundov never skimps on the melody either giving listeners something to follow for its nearly ten-minute length if you find dundovs brand of repetition to be a bore dont bother flipping this slab over gavin s remix of turns the tempo down and stretches the thing out to nearly 16 divinely inspired or painful depending on your taste minutes of patient funk i could listen to terry rileys in c for days on end personally so i tend to veer towards the divinely inspired end of things as s guitar work seems to take a few cues from michael karoli cans hypnotic krautaxeman as a drum machine plinks away in the background patiently waiting for the moment to drop a fill dont hold your breath
releases on berlins tend to fall on a spectrum between danceable rhythms and noisy chaos title of air lqds track undisciplined groove from decembers remain neutral nicely captures it musics irreverent scrappiness seems like a rebellion against techno constraints following historical examples of musical disobedience like industrial and ebm labels latest from the atlanta duo is pretty well-behaved as this stuff goes both artists have softer pre-existing projects: chris daresta goes by anticipation and matthew weiner makes deep house as twins and used to be in the synth-pop duo featureless ghost on their debut release together the pair favour smouldering aggression over an outright riot sometimes promising ideas lose their spark through measured repetition and are stiff ebm-techno rollers whose stylish abjection wears thin over five-odd minutes finds a bolder stride but takes a long time to do so only the electro switch-up near the end causes its stars to align elsewhere the duo turn rigidity into a weapon techno loper balance pulverises mercurial elements fluttering synth parts chord pulses the eps strongest vocal hook against an immovable wall of drums and bass on the title track a holding-pattern beat only serves to heighten the nightmare of its digitally contorted voice

is kevin saundersons tribute to the late donna summer who was an obvious inspiration for his band inner citys diva anthems the first new inner city track in quite some time has an appropriately reverent air to it using summers own s chorus as its bittersweet hook emotional impact aside its a rote take on disco house circa : saundersons got the chord progression down but everything else is polished to an impersonal gleam even the string breakdown feels forced and after a while the chanting chorus turns perfunctory lazy where it should be soaring as a tribute it feels honest and heartfelt but as a comeback for a classic house act its lacking the situation isnt helped by the unimaginative choice remixers house of fer a blandly -the-moment remix with bounding korg m1 chords and cheesy white noise patches while saundersons son dantiez teams up with for an equally humdrum effort p-bens goes big-room with it and only 7th takes a risk turning the track into a butch-style vortex spider-web basslines and spoken-word snippets it takes tommy onyxs chunky radio edit to really nail the track dialling up the disco and turning down the tech it makes a far better tribute to donnas legacy sexy flamboyant and catchy than any the other versions
la is a sunny place and the music of the artists revolving around low end theory of which jennifer lee aka is a charter member tends to evoke bright midday stoner sessions but s new ep sharper more limber and more fluent than her previous work by some distance is made for overcast afternoons on the handclaps doubling as snares chintzy organ tootling around the vocal line and s vulnerable vocal each have just enough smear on them to evoke rain blurring a windows view path all before starts treating them to subtle dub techniques lee has acknowledged an early debt to trip-hop producers like dj krush as well as laptop-based beat-makers and that element is right up front on creature dreams the opening commingles a few kinds of percussion (far-away shaking tumbling kit fill conga spritz) beneath slivered guitars and contemplative piano chords the closing goes even further evoking nothing less than vintage trip-hop with its heavy breakbeat sparse atmosphere and whining acid-rock guitar but rather than sounding like mere pastiche these tracks as much as the more obviously dilla-fried or are strong statements of who she is and intriguingly where shes going
takes regular drum bass to the next level and is warmly welcomed in a genre where stagnating in dark territory had been the way of things tidy beats nestle with lush synths sparse funky horns combine with soulful vocals hypnotic breakdowns play off against more rugged stabs the album is a big funky harmony spread lovingly across two discs (one of individual tunes and one all mixed up with two bonus tracks) aka lincoln barret spectacularly showcases the smoother brighter side of drum bass while still retaining a profound upbeat funkiness it s as useful for wearing a groove in the couch as it is for busting them on the dancefloor grooves that is superb use of vocal samples layered over massive rolling grooves gives many of the tunes the instant anthem stamp of approval bass drums and melody with a cheery dash of prozac sweet
its easy to see why immunity received so much critical acclaim including a mercury music prize nomination a rarity for a techno album its beautifully written and produced packed with swooning melodies and suffused with a glowing light and warmth that bring to mind g s and brian eno with whom hopkins has worked in the past but immunity packs a surprising punch too the ten minute was a highlight over a loping beat synths steadily intensify and voices bloom from little sighs into powerful melodies hopkins tempering all the widescreen beauty with a fierce beat and crunchy glitch in the hands of and grows heavier and bleaker s version is a wonderful onslaught of gigantic kicks rushing basslines and very little else by stripping away most of the tracks rich textures blawan and pariah also undo the subtlety that gives the track so much of its staying power but their brutal brand of peak time techno is hard to fault s remix is the most successful of the three using the originals opening five seconds of analogue glitch as a jumping off point tj hertz flattens its gorgeous melodic swell into a sinister ooze and makes lush electronics dense and prickly s remix is as club ready as s yet as heavy on the glitch and squelch as s with urgent percussion and rough scraping synths that transform the ecstasy of the original into something cold and sinister
despite glowing endorsements from dj qu and levon vincent the new york producer appears uninterested in capitalising on the buzz around his name content simply with releasing records as the right opportunities present themselves his first solo jaunt of arrives on a young paris-run label with a penchant for deep us sounds toes a similar line to s first release from innerspace halflife with a deeply hypnotic and sombre aesthetic on a splintered male vocal plays out over disdainful kicks devoid of a bassline the framework hangs in mid-air fluttering synths and cascading keys combine to tough but eerily soothing effect nderson decreases the intensity further still on repeatedly layering the phrase mindset mindset its definitely a mindset over a sedate body of synths and humming drums ttitude feels similarly at ease with faint emotive nudges softening its heavy kicks and militant snares hazy fog of synths only furthers the feeling
s star has shot up in recent months with much attention and bookings following this excellent release his 12 with pacou and remix work for pole he is however no newcomer to the world of techno having been djing since 1 83 and releasing deep house/detroit records since 1 5 his recently lauded releases have all been dub-techno and the side continues in this vein his deep house producing pedigree however shines through in all the tracks: where some dub-techno can be a bit listless on the floor no has no such problems sucking chords and subtle washes provide the dancefloor impetus in a track that could have been lost to atmospherics in less experienced hands the tracks on the b side sound closer to his house work on harmonie park in the 0s yet retain the subtle delays of the languid chords and melodies characterise these two cuts and while neither are suited for the prime time both will serve well as tracks for warming up or winding down ccording to s myspace this 12 is already sold out sure sign along with his bookings at places such as panoramabar and fabric that deeper sounds such as these are finding increased popularity with clubbers with music as good as this its a trend im happy to see

this beauty is outworldly - s reach is not only ethereal soothing and angelic but a devastating behemoth on the dance floor - s production skills are top notch with this release the original mix is an electro tribal/deep house piece in a progressive mindstate built around the melody the original starts up-tempo with a nice piano key a rolling drum pattern with a lovely b-line slowly working its way in is the female vocal that gets full attention once you hear it very ethereal tones and light piano keys are gently layered over the voice with the melody sitting next to the vocals from there the track stays on course with the b-line and some nice precession work throughout the rest of the track solid production work from - on a track that can be used on the dance floor headphones or between the sheets (if you know what i m sayin ) deep vibes all around the flip is brought to you by fretwell in-house producer has become very much in-demand as of late with his last remix duty for bedrock s forge the fretwell mix is a no nonsense breakbeat starting the track with just the beat and vocal soon gently the swirls and moody sound structures come in to present a very dark sound once the breakdown starts and the vocals return the track becomes silent while the vocalist seduces you into her world once there the breakbeat kicks in again for a short min and soon after fades away with the vocals gliding it out very melodic and lush; fretwell s interpretation is not only beautiful but also very much an a-side in its own right moody deep exotic and sexy this released came out around the end of but i have to say that this is one of the best tracks i ve heard in the new year
is a continuous 7-minute composition that was recorded over the span of two years in several different locations that idea might sound like a mess but in the hands of australian experimental veteran it turns out beautifully fluid is not exactly a solo effort: it features among others jim orourke thomas brinkmann an icelandic orchestra and the japanese tabla player u-zhaan these disparate collaborators and separate sessions are so carefully woven together by ambarchi that sounds like one recording which may be the records most impressive quality the only constant here is thomas brinkmanns staticky pulse an electric heartbeat that pounds in double time its unwavering patter somehow both soft and gritty plays aural tricks on the mind: at some points it seems to skip and other times it jells with the other elements to create a thicker headier rhythm brinkmanns beat is the central element of the records first movement but it fades into the background for the more assertive second part which hints at clicks cuts -style glitch something thats even more apparent on the brief fourth movement which is basically a wireframe of springy percussion those wonderfully weird drum sounds come from percussionist matt chamberlain who also dominates part three the albums de facto centrepiece its a plateau of gently rolling techno embellished by ambarchis guitar the first four movements of are quietly hesitant the -minute closer on the other hand is pure payoff sliding into the lush meditative embrace of u-zhaans tabla and eyvind kangs violas coming after the spartan hinterlands of part four its almost comforting for an artist who has traditionally experimented with recording methods is another landmark thanks largely to how natural it sounds in spite of its ambitious approach
is quite possibly the most clich d song name you could come up with hot toddy though comes up with the goods here in conjunction with ron asejam to create a track that has histrionics enough to fulfill the promise its title suggests moves deliciously slow on purpose luring you in to its sub-100 pm charm t allows you to luxuriate in each kick hearing the imaginary drummer trying their best not to rush things ts a deep pocket but it gives room for asejams mantra you could be mine always to take on the sort of weight that it deserves before the piano synths and strings amp things up to almost unbearable levels morgan geist has never been a man of such grandiose gestures and he doesnt disappoint here providing a lovely and restrained version of which almost completely disregards the vocals altogether he doesnt need them though: his expert arrangement speaks more than asejam ever could geist moves just as slowly but here its things like horns kick drums and guitar lines that take on import fter a slightly disappointing remix of catholic earlier this year its an assured return to form
terry leys cid rain was as good an acid house compilation as theres ever been one thing it had a hell of a lot of music on it: a staggering 1 tracks in total but it was leys deft eye for selecting overlooked gems that made the collection shine ley is particularly well placed to revisit the era he was central to the k acid house explosion of the 80s through his many boys own related ventures he was instrumental as anybody in spreading the house music gospel boys own crew not only published the first article on penned by paul oakenfold they also held the first documented outdoor acid rave in 1988 cid rain s follow up cid thunder is spread across five discs re are plenty of anthems joe smooths promised land and s sed to name just two but as with the first compilation its the more obscure cuts that really make this worth your time res not space here to list all the highlights but if had to name just one it would be the perfectly stripped down funk of s like so much music on cid thunder it still sounds fresh years after its release s striking about cid thunder is the range of styles pervasive in houses early days many records nod to the genres pre history res is just one example of a d y disco record made with cheap synths instead of big budget string sections crystalines sounds like the new wave and euro disco records popular in chicagos clubs before the term house music was coined sometimes you can hear producers throwing everything at the wall at once ts mixes rap loleatta holloway vocal yelps and a sample inspired by a disco edit kind of hip house may sound incredibly dated but it has an energy thats hard to deny other side of cid thunder shows the more experimental end of early house music was unimaginable music inspired by edgy clubs and sweat soaked dancers made by na ve kids whod bought the wrong equipment and didnt know how to use it records like s looking or s are simply relentless se tracks still sound crazy even today; one can only imagine the mind melting impact they would have had on young impressionable brains back in the day ach disc on cid thunder has its own theme tribute disc to is worth a mention especially since ley and were close much of the music is a poignant reminder of just how good was one is full of tracks that made his own at power plant a club that laid out a manifesto for house music thats still being followed today se is a dance record thats arguably never been bettered ts indicative of undying influence over the house sound he helped create ley has documented acid house brilliantly on cid thunder nless you know every record on here and frankly thats unlikely it is definitely worth investigating not every track is a winner but the strike rate is high and the best selections feel as relevant today as ever
its always hard to say if or when dan lopatin is trying to be funny that would be unusual enough in a high-ish pr ile drone artist and unusual enough to explain some his appeal but if he is his irony is thick enough to pass as anything but it was sort funny that he began his first mass-market album after scores tapes and limited vinyl runs with a blast noise but i dont think it was a joke there was no break a smile no follow-through the people willing to wade through returnal s smog melodic keyboards handled it just fine theyre used to it his face has proven indomitably straight even through the molasses-thick synth pop album he made with his sinusoidal friend ford earlier this year hes not kidding even when he is his second mass-market record is called this isnt a joke either ins ar as lopatin aims to say anything in particular the title is just an indication whats in the box: a record formed almost entirely loops but well come back to that because ends with what im pretty sure is a real honest-to-goodness joke finishes the 40-ish minutes f with a swell fake choirs and rich whole ascending notes its lovely but it wouldve been too cheesy even for returnal s gasping vapors here all things considered its pretty funny because spends most its time wheezing and twitching its full glottal stops and impetuous yelps it spends its bulk setting up inexorable rhythms then poking them full holes where many his peers and forebears build their ambience from microscopic variations on the same few sounds lopatin doesnt settle for long opens with the closest things he has to a personal palette: scratchy almost emphysematic swells and distant klaxons breaking in waves then the whole thing drops out and turns into a drain-swirl errant ticks and drums they may even be two different songs but the loop-based structure makes it feel inevitable that the former should turn into the latter just as when rears up from a field-ish gas cloud with cut-up vocals into a sieved r b far f on the horizon even at his most horizontal like on the piano-and-sawtooth title track the loops mean hes always trading in rhythm and thats where is most exciting and snap and skip like warped lock-grooves though the latter evolves into a lounge keyboard for its sunset close puffs up with deep robot drums and serpentine lines and samples an mia squawk and chases her away with fm static and percussion from an old toy drum machine on paper it reads like a mess and it is but its a mess on repeat it forms a logic all its own pinging back over and over again until its done and then happens with some fake enya twirls which is pretty funny and a perfectly errant way to end a record that earns its livelihood by errancy drone lives and dies by its inviolability and rigidity but lopatin throws that away in favor something madder weirder and altogether more enticing
sam shepherd and lexander nuts records are on a serious roll at the moment shepherds fantastically wonky jazz-house tracks as floating points may be flying off the shelves and warranting multiple represses but the rest of their family and vocalists fatima and shuanise are also firing on full cylinders the two ladies of the crew have done their best to reclaim r and soulful pop from the major labels with their two 12-inches while s kleer threw together boogie hip-hop electro and todd edwards-esque cut-ups in an accomplished and irresistible fashion its not difficult to guess which genre hes tried to amalgamate into his retrofuturist repertoire by looking at the title of the -side cut of shes cid ut this isnt just any old acid house pastiche loping along at 102 pm its fusion of hip-hop and house comes across a bit like a mix between dam funk and donis with the minimalist beats giving the heavy emulated t -303 (which does actually sound pretty faithful) and surging cosmic synths plenty of space to do their thing is another cut for djs who want to cruise along at a slow beat but still rock the club in a totally different way its one of those tracks which constantly builds with jagged arpeggios and ascending sirens blaring out over its stomping mechanical beat its slightly cheesy vocodered vocal may polarise opinion with some jocks but theres no question about the quality of the production with a forthcoming release scheduled on hyperdub it looks as if is going to be an artist to keep an eye on
of course is all over the place is all over the place too and has been from its inception it started as a rap label with veteran nashville mc count bass d the most striking thing by far from the string of backpacker fare that constituted ramps first few years n in 2008 ramp issued s and its mo shifted to crafty auteurist bass music since which leads off the compilation cd celebrating the labels 50th release ramp has released consistently good music from a lot of big comers from ( hot city ) to l flying lotus kimonsta) with satellites in helsinki ( ) and new york ( ) yet the label has hung slightly back from the musics front lines ramp has long seemed more like those artists favorite holiday house than a home base per se nor has it issued anything quite as galvanizing as midnight request line (tempa) or untrue (hyperdub) or hyph mngo (hotflush) to name a quick three in part because so much of what ramp puts out falls into a genre interzone that cuts a less imposing more muted figure than its more clearly zoned peers i also think thats part of why works so well its compilation is old fashioned in a cd era sort of way: fill an 80 minute disc keep the tracks more or less chronological pick the best stuff and let the accumulated evidence speak more completely as a whole than it did in pieces nd since many of the tracks have multiple threads running through them hearing them in this configuration leads to multiple kinds of song to song engagements s and noche xs among others make a surprisingly three dimensional case for 8 bit broken rhythm and jagged keyboards of s is contextualized further by the bumptious dilla homage of ras s remix of gelatinous r b vocals and slow mo bass pressure of 2562s remix of and the s meet their funhouse match in the spiffier jamie remix of s discovery for me is s a sparse but vibe filled conga led house track: when the beguilingly muffled vocal sample comes in it could be a 1993 masters at work b side but when the turkish flavored violin appears it sounds like something else altogether is it bass does it matter
swiss label sog records next release comes from keenan vs bajwa anderson ft endc this is the teaming of navigation records headman stewart keenan along with dale anderson and bajwa who you will be familar with from their take on burfunks -outsider from its beginning shapes up to be a deep roller as clean cut beats and energetic rhythm begin to take hold along with a synth melody that conjures up a pensive mood this strips away as the vocals are added while another melody creeps in developing further as the pace eases back for a brief moment giving way to soothing pads and lead sound working off each other leaning towards peaktime from start to finish the subtle workings of the track are controlled by the highly emotive vocals of endc and edges up a notch at every drop out a stel remix is lined up which will see this release hit the shelves in november and with tracks in the pipeline on lost language we should expect more exciting sounds from this uk crew
s 100 galcher mix which showcased an albums worth of original material rocketed the new york artist to underground fame in 2013 as it should have his formula of dimly-lit chords and hip-house rapping was irresistible endearingly old school and fresh at the same time aside from put on almost all the tracks from the mix went unreleased new eps on white material and tsuba offered up other work while his road hog alias focused on instrumental material but now with his own label he has released the rest of 100 galcher on two eps each 12-inch is anchored to a different track: and its punchy woodblock groove on one record and the more bleary-eyed on the other both of them prominently featuring lustwerks coolly detached verses were among the most memorable on the mix to sweeten the package he throws in dub versions of both which highlight the delicacy of his production style behind those vocals is smooth and opalescent something that might have come from the heyday of underground quality aside from the chunky drum track crickets briefer tunes the building blocks of 100 galcher make up the rest youve got the forlorn synths of (the generic name for the mixs many interludes) the creamy chords of and the balearic goodness of which feels uplifting yet maintains lustwerks effortless cool a track like breezes by in the mix but here it stands out on its own even if youve heard these tracks a hundred times before you havent heard them like this

londons has shown again and again that he has a knack for poignant melodies as such hes a natural fit for ascs series which encourages drum bass producers to stretch their legs out a bit though the two meatier tracks on kdcs second entry are by definition drum bass theyre ruled more by their blurry but evocative backdrops than their kick drums kdcs work often toes the line between saccharine and genuinely moving and hes never been closer to the precipice than 8 1 the eight minute track has a smooth digital pulse not unlike an ekg machine gently dusted with cascading pianos and heart-tugging violins yes violins somehow the tracks glacial cruise cushions the impact of such obvious devices and the interplay of the tracks plasticky percussion with the chromed string surfaces is interesting enough it might still be a bit hard to swallow for some but the three-minute ambient interlude 8 2 a playground of sampled textures should help to distract the third (and even longer) track fares better with chords that ebb and flow like the tides
portlands is something of an anomaly: a dub label that releases new music from new producers and appeals to purists and neophytes alike theyre fine sticking to roots sounds but also unafraid to step outside of those boundaries as evidenced by recent releases from beat pharmacy and dj aka peter simon the latter artist returns with a two tracker for zamzam which works like a one two punch along with s debut 7 inch the records highlight dance music producers who dont typically make straight up dub of the two is most comfortable working with this sound his dubstep productions have always owed a debt to reggae (he even started a label focused on reconciling dubsteps ancestors with its descendants appropriately called roots future ) his zamzam debut from last year had a flair for traditional stuff with hints of digi dub and is a worthy follow up his dubstep history comes through in the 140 bpm tempos though its more obvious in the way the music swings whats striking about these tracks is the way simon weaves the bassline through the melodies themselves pushing it all forward rather than hobbling on low end zig zags snakes through its runtime while sits on hollow percussion as circus organs add an eerie tint german producer daniel pirkl brings a more dramatic perspective on upping the tempo past 150 the flute driven blends old and new sounds as long melodica notes sigh over rhythms that kick and sputter like footwork the slightly faster hints at dmz style dubstep with a broken bassline complementing some classic dub horns as with simons 7 inch these tracks approach old school dub with fresh arrangements and sonics
if you needed any more convincing that saw something of a dub techno revival look no further than s quantec this year he released two 12s of quality post- asic channel dub techno on styrax leaves and echocord and now he is back for more of the same on francois k s imprint lthough the genre crown might currently belong to deepchord s echospace project they ll surely be looking over their shoulders at schienhammer although where modell and hitchell are more concerned with heavily embellished textures and atmospheres schienhammer sticks to a mantra of simplicity is key gently nudging his tracks close to the dancefloor using only a few elements the -side here is a case in point repetitive and hypnotic what at first seems still and steady slowly reveals itself to be dynamic and changing quiet drone infinitesimally increases throughout giving pressure and weight to the finale accompanied by clouds of smoky sounds swirling over a steady heartbeat incredibly it takes nearly three minutes for the snare to drop but rather than let it sit there schienhammer lets it slowly dissolve down in the wash of dividing synth splashes such that it never seemed there it all that is until it suddenly drops again y the time it all fades out at ten minutes there is so much going on that the beginning seems a million miles away the title track ural is more straight up content to let the echoing patterns do the work here perhaps a little more bass weight or some more high end percussion would tease out more but still there is not much to complain about not as profoundly deep or banging as asic channel but like echospace a more emotive trip overall it s great to see some good old heroin techno enjoying something of a revival
s inquiring mind has led him into some interesting projects over the years including work with fever ray and as half of roll dice but most of his solo experiments have been sheathed in a dark industrial casing which is starting to look pretty drab lately hes found some more eye-catching looks re was swedish congo record on which he used synths to painstakingly reproduce recordings made in 1930s central congo and a strange and sweaty dance ep for ultimate hits his new album tries out yet more fresh colours t doesnt have a congo-like concept (probably a good thing given the knotty appropriation questions raised by that record) but it does have a sort of protagonist the synth pop artist glasser whose voice binds the album together course mannerfelt doesnt settle for simply framing her voice with his asymmetric beats nstead he weaves it deep into the fabric of his music on opener a single wordless note repeats alongside a handful of other sounds each spinning carefully around the others like the arms of a childs mobile on mannerfelt fades between the words create and growth while dry precise drum patterns tense and relax much of the album uses this structure setting a few loops into uneven motion and then letting them splay apart and reform most tracks dont seem to go anywhere but by the time they finish were somewhere quite unexpected mannerfelt gets a lot of variety from his approach billowing chords of and recall dub techno; the formers sour guitar twangs are particularly juicy elsewhere the mood is spookier as on and whose b-movie atmosphere gives way to weird blasts of choir sometimes mannerfelt riffs on the club-leaning sound of his ultimate hits record is oddball techno with the compulsive bounce of oni ayhun album highlight perspective is bizarre cubist electro t might be potent on a dance floor but as ever mannerfelt cant stop tweaking things shuffling patterns around to send dancing bodies reeling off balance glassers voice doesnt emerge fully formed from this strange soup until the closing track on which mannerfelts exploratory loops are arranged into something like a song ts no less original than lots of his solo work but quite a bit more entertaining to listen to
debuting at 10 on the release records hype chart the has been creating that kind of hype that any production act would love if you haven t heard about these guys before alex and simon are from montreal and are putting canada on the map along with a host of other canadians who are making some great music boss mv supports this release with a remix of his own the original mix is a minimal tribal burner with sharp stabbing sounds and light high-end samples the are known for their strong vocals and this track certainly delivers that smooth but edgy the vocals slides under carefully laid filters while the lyrics stay fresh and ever changing between lyrics the production retains a progressive feel with simple beat programming and subliminal melodic sounds as the original goes for over 11 minutes there is a lot still to be heard once in the last half of the mix as the breakdown displays some nice percussion and vocal loops more tribal beats simple melodies and lyrics keep the track running to the end a track with great appeal both in clubs and mainstream mv s back in the day mix moves more into house territory with warm sounds solid beats and light vocal effects a catchy baseline is introduced along with sustained synths and works well against bouncing high-hats and the original vocal a nice summery guitar solo plays teasing along the baseline but the real fun is the breakdown uplifting emotive synths entwined with the echoing vocal add a great dramatic touch as the smooth rhythm comes back in i am quite surprised with this release as the quality is excellent the original production breaks down a few genre boundaries while mv s mix takes on a totally new perspective and nails it recommended
deliver the first release for a label co run by young dj and producer chris lake and hooj man bobby m is the name of the forst track and it already has been causing quite a stir with the big dj s such as pete tong sasha john digweed and danny howells all giving it a good run for their money it comes equipped with 3 different mixes with the original dave robertson and blue haze mix all equipped with something memorable on the a-side is the original mix a sublime melody begins proceedings as some nice subtle percussion soon enters the track the deep baseline is the next feature accompanied with the kick as all the elements combine early in the piece the track maintains a smooth flow until some enchanting strings make a presence as do the melodic overtones a smooth and heart warming production this original mix is also on the a-side is the dave robertson a+d mix a much deeper affair the baseline dominates this remix despite being placed deep in the layer of sounds the drums are solid and snippets of the main melody feature throughout a looped melodic piano line however gives the remix its drive and energy it s another solid piece of music from dave robertson a producer in great form on the flip is the very impressive blue haze melody extract mix a solid kick opens the track as the piano melody makes an impact early the drums build the track in the first half until the track breaksdown in stunning fashion midway in the melodies trickle while the strings and baseline bring shivers down the spine the beats come back in with effects as a high combined with the lush melodies still ringing with great presence a stunning remix what can be said about this release is that all 3 productions are very solid and all have some positive aspects its simply put a storming debut for and one that musn t be overlooked if this is just a taste of things to come expect big things from the label as quality is surely assured with as the early benchmark
for the next release on the often top class sex on wax imprint the trio of desyn masiello omid nourizadeh and leon roberts team up as to deliver a purely devastating feast of techno music with their latest amalgamation in sound first up is the intense techno monster and as the name suggests the track is quite simply massive from the word go we are treated to some pulsating filtered beats that lead into the main gritty baselines that make this track the monster that it is the beats are quirky and upbeat and the vibe is extreme throughout as this track lets rip for its entire duration on the flip are the bouncy sounds of cold not as evil and thrashing as the a-side cold does its business with a solid bouncing baseline and some quirky beat patterns and percussion nice melodic touches deep in the track give it that extra edge making the track quite a delightful culmination of quirky sounds and deep grooves another quality release on a very sexy label but what did you expect when you team up three of the brightest production and dj talents in one studio

s music doesnt reveal much judging by his online presence (or lack thereof) theres likely a reason for that all he gives you on his myspace page at the moment is a bed bath and beyond of static to look at no bio no chart no nothing you have to highlight his name to simply ensure youre in the right place broadly gibson makes techno but like one of his obvious heroes jeff mills its much more than that the collapse ep neatly encapsulates nearly every facet of gibsons sound from static-laden jack to mood-driven plodders and provide the former a duo of no-nonsense stormers that have what sound like the tiniest bit of static wrapped around the pounding kick drum it gives both tracks a nervous quality as if things could soon explode into something far more dangerous has the same sort of edge but puts it toward melodic ends its akin to aphexs ventolin though in that its hard to imagine why youd ask such a filthy siren to provide such a lovely chord progression (the point of course ) the most striking moment of all though is the quiet hum of it shows gibson doing something that (as far as we know) hes rarely done before you could even call it revealing
records continue their assault of upfront floorshakers with a swift follow up to retroids glitch disco ep this time round taking a club friendly angle with from mocean featuring michelle chivers on vocals the original mix keeps things at a busy pace from the onset as tough beats and glassy percussive elements build with the addition of claps springy stabs and murmuring melody which glows underneath proceedings build to a point before chivers sensual vocals are thrown in filtering subtly in-between the mix delaying in places and complimented by elongated string chords the break strips it back before making off again with all the pieces back in place with the help of an acidic touch theres two re-rubs in the package first of which is the andrew kelly remix churning out a phat mix of forceful synth stabs broken up rhythms and dirtying the groove with attitude the joel armstrong mix is as highly charged as the original utilising m cs vocals with maximum tweakage ontop of an almost minimal combination of splutery synthlines and jackin percussion
artificial intelligence had some notable hits in their 13-odd years together but nothing ever came close to knocking desperado off its pedestal like many stone-cold classics the track was beautifully simple with a catchy vocal making it stick and enough serotonin-soaked chords to keep you grinning n theres the second artificial intelligence album it isnt timeless in the desperado sense but its relationship with time is an interesting one it doesnt feel connected to any one era or sound nor does it follow a linear progression as its title suggests instead we get odd tangents where old meets new whereas a debut album stand alone was produced with a complex array of hardware over four years was put together in about 18 months with a significantly slimmer setup res a shiny new digital sheen to it but a compositional quirks and vintage soundbites are still present its their old sound brought up to date the best of which comes from the uplifting liquid feel of and thats the pairs forte: light feel-good drum bass often with guest vocalists driving it home and theres plenty of that here from singers like ( re ) and ( ) maybe those songs are the nostalgic side of but they mostly come off as outdated when mcs and jump on and however the sound gets darker tougher and weaponised its jungle with a facelift for modern-day and those moments are where really hits the mark
marea stamper is becoming quite the name in chicago these days shes the head booker for smart bar the citys premiere club and one of the most well-known on the continent and her sets are crate-digger catnip for classic house and disco heads (theyre played with real panache too) but shes also a producer and ahead of a much-anticipated ep on stripped chewed she lands on chrissys fledgling nite owl diner label is fuzzy around the edges like a disco edit made out of vague memories mumbled vocals warbling chimes and some careful strings all give it a delirious feel as if it could go on forever like that which makes the shake-up halfway through all the more surprising switching to a driving bassline and a punchy but muted horn refrain the track slowly comes back down to a cool fading out with an extended intro the fat-bottomed is funkier and its almost psychedelic moving-in-reverse effects make it sound like stamper is chopping up records on the fly both sides sounding lush and timeless would go perfectly in one of her decades-spanning sets
go for the synth pop jugular on their third album back when it was hannes norrvides solo project lfy released a series of noisey casio-driven post-punk with vocals that sounded like a cro magnon rebirth of ian curtis since then norrvides loosened his grip inviting loke rahbek (of v r) and malthe fischer to join now having brought outr house and techno influences into the mix (namely on 2013s perfect view ) lfy sets its sights on the studio-sheen of pet shop and duran duran does hit its mark that depends on whether norrvides voice unintelligible for most of lfys existence can achieve the stadium-ready heft of his influences for the most part he succeeds not unlike bernard sumner of order norrvide imbues the jangly with a sense of romantic longing convincing hooks abound on but at times the lyrical content feels like a madlib of synth pop clich s the chorus of ends with: feels like youre falling but it passes in time into a better day our hearts our heads in other words lyrics that sound ok but lack any context to give them meaning the albums second half finds the group in a more comfortable groove starting with n the songs become more straightforward discarding the ornate fussiness of earlier tracks one of the albums highlights pairs a lurching waltz with 4ad-style guitar arpeggios and emotional threadbare vocals on a clever studio effect sends norviddes vocals rocketing out of bells and synths like a lethargic version of karl hyde (its opening verse approaches the bliss of underworlds born slippy ) the album dwells on verbs that imply motion such as falling and running the final (title) track continues this theme treating travel and movement as two sides of the same coin sampling a babel of foreign voices evokes the disorienting feeling of waking up in a different airport terminal day after day the travel theme is not limited to physical distance taken further the record could be about norrvides journey from angsty bedroom producer to road-weary synth pop frontman that this transition has taken less than four years is impressive imperfect as it is is proof that the groups future is limited only by the force of its wanderlust
the next release on the always improving comes from the duo of darius syrossian fattorini and their latest work first up is the winter solstice mix is a pretty dark and driving affair moving along very nicely with a moody and sinister baseline vocal effects keep the mystical vibe of the track in tact for the most part as does the smooth and deep breakdown midway in i must say this is quite a solid production mainly due to the very tasty low end sounds and solid drums the darius syrossian solo mix is a pretty interesting and unique upbeat mix the beats are very solid and somewhat muffled especially due to the fact that the percussion and surrounding sounds are often effected and filtered there is a huge baseline that rides underneath the track for the most part and also a pretty funky interlude late on adding to this very vibrant production finally the summer solstice mix closes the ep off with a mix that has seen very strong support from hector romero in particular to be honest it is a very nice remix featuring smooth sounds and intricate percussion and an all round summer vibe it closes off a very tasty release from wallop that continues to see their form as a label rise and rise
the bb of this eps title doesnt meander about it slinks in and gets down to business: charging anthemic tech house that comes as something of a surprise since s work has frequently been marked by warped timbres and feel here he tweaks many aspects of the track the throbbing lead synth particularly as well as the percussion but the whole is clearly focused its the best version here by far dewaltas pair of remixes extend it in one direction apiece with the rework putting almost all the emphasis on percussion for a while the verses are marked with what sounds like filtered handclaps till the other instruments finally join back in while the digital-only rework bustles nicely on the low end but is sort of one-note on top tt stands for the eps highlight here ludwig largely leaves the tech behind and focuses on the house in the latter-day deep -manqu style but he doesnt seem like hes trying to prove how much realer he is than anyone else and it works to his advantage the dusky bass throb is equally comfortable hosting futuristic detroit synth chords a snatch of flute straight off an old mo wax sample pack and dudes muttering things it doesnt hurtle like but it stays with you longer

two of the best kompakt artists on a back to back single is a salivating prospect and the results more than live up to expectations this is so good that it s hard to pick the better of the two sides oth feature long tracks with complicated arrangements and a hint of neo trance just where it s wanted bringing a little excess and flamboyance to proceedings razilian kicks off where his chromophobia album finished off with a track named after the russian folk dolls hidden one inside the other taking his cue from the dolls perhaps carefully decorates each successive passage with new variations of subtle percussion and spacious pulses each layer is a new realm of melody and texture to mine but rather than get smaller like the dolls these seem to grow bigger and deeper throughout the track the result is some seriously pulsating pop techno that has you instantly where it wants you to be and then gives you some is at his opulent best on the flip russian duo continue to lift their own high bar offering like a complicated and pulsating number riddled with progressive and disintegrating moments opening with an ambient drift nother cid suddenly bursts into light then slowly builds into an unconscious and yet quietly frenetic track chiming and reflective it is tinged with just enough darkness as is always the case with together these two tracks are arguably the perfect kompakt sound of now

is greek producer yiannis os who has released well-received eps for bedrock and vapour good references indeed but even those don t prepare you for the sheer quality of this album d i y is a treat from its origami packaging to the obvious care and attention given to the music the fourteen tracks are segued together in a loose sense not like a dj set but like a continuous work in progress the whole effect is like an hour long head massage as synthesized sounds drift in and out of focus and subtle riffs rise from the depths the music ranges from easy going downtempo as in the very opening to solid deep house this is where really excels with all the breakdowns placed perfectly and some real power in the chord progressions particularly the anthemic espero sun just about the pick of the album and a potential balearic smash if ever there was one the brooding chrysalis is already well known in the clubs and features a strong bass line while sidewalk lovin is a strangely touching track with reminders of jam spoon in the japanese vocal while the uptempo tracks tend to fare better the balance is just right the mood set for nocturnal widescreen listening the plush sound effects may sound quite early 90s but they are so incredibly well produced it s impossible not to warm to them an ambitious debut album then at well over an hour but this is clearly a man who s learnt well from ambient acts such as the orb as well as more uptempo material such as early paul van dyk as a smoky chillout album d i y is well nigh perfect
london grime producer and terror danjah protege d o k has been around for a long long time almost as long as terror himself but i wont be surprised if you have no idea who he is standing in the shadows for much of his career he produced some well-known tracks like crazy titchs i can c u without much acclaim but the current instrumental grime revival orchestrated primarily by fledgling label and a few like-minded compatriots has swept up the veteran producer and revitalized his sound much in the same manner that mu did for terror danjah in 2009 d o k s sound is lean and sinewy underlining his fluorescent melodies with deep rolling basslines and elastically snapping beats is quite possibly the producers most extroverted and memorable beat yet cribbing a theme from sonic the hedgehog 2 and fashioning a track that sums up all of grimes trends in chiptune synths check winding and soulful melodies chugging horizontal bassline check smooth funk bends and jazzy tangents check a sly grin and a wink you know it hard not to love from its very opening bars it pairs the very real nostalgia of a popular video game with the imagined nostalgia of recent instrumental grime a remarkably effective move in infantilizing the otherwise hyper-masculine genre d o k portrays its cartoonish aggression as just that: a cartoon formidably catchy and infectious in the process on the other side is not quite as significant but it pairs a seasick and upturning bassline with worried synths vocal interplay becomes a rare factor as doo-wop samples balance atop of the audibly volatile concoction with longer soulful melismas occasionally wafting out of the sulfurous bubbling its again exaggerated and even humourous but else would you expect from a producer who builds every single one of his beats with a ha vocal sample
its common to assume that a song reflects something thats already happened to the composer in the case of s latest single however the tune seems to prophesize the fate of erol when he tried his hand at a remix the press release offers a rare glimpse into the psychic perils of the creative process: originally erol remixes a different tune from the rock bands innerspeaker lp sends it to the label then remixes it again five more times before apparently succumbing to distress over the whole thing desiring nothing other than to have his remix erased from the earth he then writes a cheeky impassioned letter to modular instructing the label to tell the band they imagined [the remix] and that if they cant ill come and brainwash them or maybe even blow so hard into their ears that it pushes the memory out of their skins ut rather than throw in the towel erol asks to remix wont r mind instead announcing i have an idea for it i think its a good one i can hear it already and i love it already its like ive known it since i was a child can you get me the parts please ill turn it around in hours with the fits and starts of inspiration ostensibly behind him erol hits his stride turning the groups swirling eatles-y psych pop into an electro-tinged adrenaline rush giving most of the floor to the tunes churning snakelike guitar riffs ive often found innerspeaker to be highly effective for jogging purposes and i have to think that erols version will come in handy for olympic tryouts equally workout-ready is pilooskis rework of yits a fitting match up as both the frenchman dj and the aussie rock group have a penchant for mid-60s rhythm sections its another reminder that pilooski and his dirty pals are for some reason still one of the few dj entities out there happy to inject electronic dance music with a bit of shimmy and shakehthe result here like erols exudes a joyous abandon while the vocals cry come back to me like a stoned plea from george harrison the music barreling underneath all revved up and ready to go seems more than happy to leave lucidity in the dust
it s safe to say that the popularity of london based dj desyn masiello is going through the roof at the moment it s quite funny though because desyn has been around the scene for quite a while now developing his love for house music in the early 90 s it has only been the last 2 or so years where his impact has been made perhaps starting with his essential mix in 2004 and of course his very people friendly bedrock original series mix this time desyn has been called up to mix balance 008 and his job is to continue the fantastic run of releases for this australian based mix compilation unlike the bedrock mix this is the first time desyn has released a double mix album and he uses both discs to full effect to deliver a very tasty album the first half of this first disc is a real highlight beginning with the smooth opening tune mbira by will saul the flow is quite seductive here with smooth productions by new ordinament and clashing egos featuring jelle paulusma with the latter featuring a very tasteful bouncing bassline and upbeat drums love crisis by williams is perhaps a highlight tune of the mix using some beautiful low end riffs and some smooth atmospheric surroundings chelonis jones gets into the act with his smooth house tones of one on one while babak shayan delivers a tasty treat with flowers a production that also features a hint of depeche mode s classic blasphemous rumours rene amesz and then mark clement take the mix up a notch with some chunkier house sounds while the dub of our lips are sealed showcases the more uplifting sounds of his repertoire as smooth high pitched pads work their way alongside a smooth and funky bassline new ordinament once again feature with a stunning production full of retro synths and a driving vigor to it soulsearcher s massive can t get enough gets a touch up by the talented derek howells who delivers a quirky twisted reworking the idiots take the pace down a notch with a smooth bassline driven journey while chris lake ends the piece with an uplifting piano ridden anthem in piano tool the 2nd mix starts off with the orbital s classic halcyon + on + on a track that defies the ageing process with its beautiful aura spirals x ensures that this mix is quick to get going with an uplifting treat early in the piece it is then followed by the stunning blue by rozzo a track that is sure to tear the roof off any club worldwide the vocals of moloko are combined with the sounds of killing joke in a daring but brilliant combo by desyn while the deep chunky basslines continue with the sexy crush the bits dealers choice explode onto the scene with bomb the place another stunning production that adds to the brilliance of this 2nd disc so far there is a subtle lift in the pace with tracks by wise and then hong kong micros as desyn starts thrash out some peak time house a fact emphasised by the very large paul rincon remix of coburn s we interrupt this program ramsay unleash one for the ladies in the very funky dirty delicious and that s not all in this department as joey negro comes to the table with his rather impressive dub of make a move on me desyn now starts to get a little nastier as he puts daisuke matsuska s asian blue rose deep in the mix and then follows this up with the twisted mfa remix of ellen allien s magma it s left to tim paris to close things off with his simply breathtaking remix of karu in what is a riveting way to end this brilliant mix off i ll be honest and say that i thought desyn s bedrock mix was one that gradually tired with time slowly losing my interest as the months went on but with this mix i think he has gone the other way you can tell a lot of thought has gone into this mix and the flow and directions of both discs show this there is something quite seductive about desyn s style something that almost makes his music exclusively suited to the club atmosphere it is this mix however that changes that making him not only a fantastic live dj but now making him one of the quality dj s to mix a quality compilation but then again what else would you expect from this balance series and a dj who continues to show why he is one of the hottest talents around

liverpool based minimal recordings return with a two tracker from the duo of dj o n n o and rocco mundo that delivers some tougher tribal edges sounds is this is first up and it is quite a dark tribal stormer that flows with some very solid drum patterns and some sinister synth stabs it has a real chunky flow through and is quite minimal in sounds but not at all minimal in its overall strength little compression has a similar chunky house vibe thanks to some deep driving baselines as well as the trademark solid drum patterns again the track flows a little too similarly throughout and somewhat lacks a little something to make it really attack the senses

after years of quarantine on his own nonplace label s otherworldly world music is starting to infect the wider ecosystem last years the pestle for latency was a career highpoint and torontos marionette will soon release further recordings from friedman this release on the berlin label follows a remix he did for their last release from andreas tilliander as with the latency record it consists of older tracks on the pestle knowing this fact made the vivid timeless music even more powerful whose contents date from 94-99 doesnt quite pull this off theres a slightly dated stoner vibe for instance to the lazy dub skank of but weird details such as the sci-fi flickers of wah-wahed bass dry and teasingly polyrhythmic percussion and vapour-like ride cymbal still carry it the other tracks are ultra-subtle rhythm pieces made from soft percussion and micro-samples and r offer moments of suspense rather than the oceanic bliss found in friedmans more dramatic productions both are quietly fascinating but the latter track takes the cake thanks to its dull ripples of delay the slower has a prim microhouse swing and the pillowy suggestion of a 4/4 kick saxophone its also in voices a riff in the latter half but doesnt get above a whisper as with everything on this release it seems like it might evaporate at any minute
aka alvaro martinez is a spanish-born london-based commercial composer and sound designer by day and a deep and techy drum bass artist by night is his second ep for critical and his third release under the moniker he debuted in 2014 with a pair of meticulously scatty sci-fi rollers on doc scotts 31 records his follow-up for criticals talent-scouting digital-only series inary was darkly playful snarling one minute ( lake monsters ) and sampling engines the next ( motor hell ) if inary was tactfully tongue in cheek systems is deadly serious which features the distinctive patois of the ristol lyricist rider is the standout its rumbling sub-bass makes you quiver with glints of stainless steel and dreamy marshmallow pads plus a few catchy vocals it doesnt get much better than this is gooey and feel-good in the centre with a tough and brittle outer layer is the warmest and deepest track bolstered by the caramel coos of the singer is robust and uplifting with tinkling glassy sounds melodic strings and a couple of squelchy bass drops to keep you piqued till the end drum bass heads should keep two eyes and ears on
n an age where the dance music edit has been misinterpreted and degraded to quantized mid tempo disco chuggers polluted with smooth bleton kicks and stretched out to yawn inducing infinity paul nickerson and francis englehardt of set the record straight so begins the press release for s latest collection of remixes ts a typically grandiose half sincere and dry witted statement that pits nickerson and englehardt proprietors of the state new york (formerly brooklyn ) record shop dope jams as martyrs crusading for impeccable tastes and authentic artistry stands up for timelessly great music even when its not in vogue or so the story goes problem is on edits 1999 they dont always live up to their rhetoric granted is fighting an uphill battle here hip house records disco tunes and dramatic soul verses arent exactly fashionable these days and they know it theres a difference between being out of fashion and sounding dated ir rework of grandpas by sounds tethered to another era and the duos emphasis on its most hackneyed elements piano vamps and tinny verses feels tacky t other times hardly alters the original and relies instead on subtle cut and paste rearrangements to vastly elevate the impact of the original tracks it seems unlikely that these barely perceptible changes are as magical as nickerson and englehardt believe them to be ir interpretation of s is nearly indistinguishable from the original the press notes call it a delightfully cracked version but those changes are hard to spot the other hand s rendering of by boldens the bass and brings the vocals into high definition which amps up the tracks theatricality and ultimately comes off a bit mawkish re are standouts on the compilation s rendition of feelin for instance might be more infectious than either the original or s bubbling remix n one of bj rks ambient numbers becomes a wonderfully weird deep house tune in nickerson and englehardts hands: bj rks eerie singing wafts over a throbbing doubled up kick drum prickly lullaby keys and strings that sound like an orchestra of aliens is a squelchy minimal beat that downplays theatrics and bears no distinct ties to a specific time period re are no hysterical vocals here no dramatic filter effects nor clich d piano progressions just flickering synth keys a muddy kick and brief moments when dusty hi hats crash into the mix strongest work on edits doesnt feel tied to a certain era or like a ham fisted attempt to stand up for cheeky bygone trends pair apparently aimed to remind us of how uplifting such sincere vocal celebrations of dancing can be no matter how unfashionable they currently seem their talk of crusading for uncool styles and aspects of dance music comes off as a way of justifying a batch of edits that at times just isnt very exciting
for the 6th release on the eq grey limited imprint we see a nice input from as he unleashes as well as his original mix ra columnist and all round good bloke hernan cattaneo has a dig with a remix on the flip first up is the original mix and it is quite a nice chunky house affair very solid and full beats are the mainstay and it also features some muffled vocal patterns as well as some smooth as silk baselines hernan cattaneo then does his thing on the flip and he also turns in a pretty solid house affair with some quirky melodic patterns wrapping itself around a very seductive baseline that is extremely chunky throughout it gets better as hernan introduces some eerie pads deep into the track that takes it up another level quite a good release here and for me it s the mix on the flip that wins it on a point decision
a shame this wasn t released earlier in the year have held it back a little too late and hindered the original s commercial viability in the process if you have tuned into the essential selection over the past few months you will no-doubt have heard the original s off-kilter vocals and the delightful guitar riff which helps transport you to ibiza and back heading straight for the ashley beedle air america mix he keeps it downright simple pulling out the chunky tribal house polish and the finished product gleams under his supervision good vibrations everyone
s yet ristols havent revealed anything about their identity though their previous two 12-inches have felt impressively full-formed and intuitive suggesting that the name might well be a pseudonym for a well-known producer (or producers) where much of the citys current output leans towards house this new two-tracker for is a proper eyes-down no-nonsense techno affair of the coasts languidly on a foundation of muffled kicks and slurred sub-bass gradually accruing extra detail terse hi-hats fragile and glassy loops as it goes fittingly given its ristol origins its spacious and dubby though it eschews the well-worn tropes of much contemporary dub-techno in favour of a more subtle approach is more direct: its groove has a nervy and self-perpetuating feel reminiscent of kassem mosses earlier releases on mikrodisko but with added swing lending things an almost garage feel its understated in the extreme consisting of little but bass and drums but wrings a great deal of momentum from those skeletal elements gradually changing its angle of attack several times across the course of six minutes
five seems like the work of someone in search of a fresh start eschewing the sinewy post-dubstep of richard attleys previous 12-inches this record introduces an organ-smeared cajual-inspired banger ( five ) and the pushy cowbell arpeggios of as a bridge between the soft-focus melodies of michael attleys first album as and his regular drum arsenal those two tracks have the best ideas but some odd additions like the tuning fork on five muddle them deeper flaws also appear like on the half-step congas of the percussion is airless and leaden and each one-shot follows the same rhythmic route as the one before it the vocal synth near the end feels unnecessary and disposable the tangy arpeggio on begins with a surer stride but once it gathers momentum it seems unsure of what to do with it attleys thin keys are left to dangle in the breakdown and the loop is recapitulated some might dismiss five for its name but the eps major problem is the mixed messages it sends the title track and promise explosive heights but attley undercuts both with underwhelming pay-offs
fans of ennio morricone and goblin will find much to love in this release the track titles connote filipino mysticism but theres an audible influence springing from the scores of spaghetti westerns and giallo horrors too earnest to be pastiche too singular to be outright homage patch over the hearts on their sleeve with cogent composition journey requires undertaking to reach the core of the extended percussive intro soundtracks what feels like a lonely venture downriver clamour of tribal ritual grows ever ominously into the foreground while my mental camera pans to a jungle silhouette carving shapes from malevolently crouching onlookers (thatll be the film score effect ) things get tense with screeching emanating from sources unknown and an increasingly bloodthirsty bang of the drums before joy the impending waterfall transpires to be nothing more than a musical mirage rpeggios with the timbre of a high-pitched harpsichord divulge the shift in light to reveal a dorado of guitar and bass nudging each other nonchalantly along a gilded progression that makes the peril before worthwhile if was for the editing suite of sergio leone lbularyo is the corn syrup red of dario rgento with all the tom rolls and timp hits of a nouveau tenebre do horror disco like it never went out of fashion (salem ooooo take note in case of a witch house backlash) it complements the macabre artwork a preparatory scene in a real-life re-enactment of the crucifixion photographed by one of the duo himself that is symbolic not of any religious hogwash but rather of what a thoroughly great mind-fuck this record is
2nd opinion are colin airey rob jay from 3 beat the due are also known as mirabeau who have just signed the massive summer anthem back from outta space to oxyd records the a side mirabeau remix starts of with tribal beats congas galore and nice subtle effects in true classic peace division style you can see where they get their influences from the techy yet funky b-line drops in perfect time and the percussion just builds and builds and then without you even noticing the sinister strings float on top of the mix just nicely the break drops with stunning effects on the vocal samples which makes the track for me the vocal and strings together sound really cool through the break then everything drops back in at once and it goes off big time top mix here from the new boys on the block the b- side mirabeau dub mix well it s pretty much like the other side but with more techy percussion and not as much use of the vocal i suppose that s why its called the dub mix but all the same quite good but the other side is the one to watch here over all a good release for sander k s ever growing label for fans of peace division steve lawler and x-press 2 you ll love this
english poet william cowper is largely unremembered aside from one famous line: variety is the spice of life those who find success however often do so because theyve thrown variety to the wayside so it must be said: the side to and s destruction is yet another techno track rife with haunting pads a slowly evolving acid line and by now a clich of their production together sixteenth note hi hats playing this track next to one of s earlier releases would lead you to believe that they were made in the same studio session more interesting is the duos ambient track which ties the ep together with some dark 303 work and a chuggingly slow bpm variety saves the day with typically slow burning deep talking acid crooner completely shakes things up with of this massive sounding dub techno burner hits all the right targets with the cavernous reverb on the percussion its depth charging bass and its perfect less is more construction heres one instance where switching things up and keeping people guessing definitely yields a divine result more than a fair share of consumers will glance at this release and already know in their mind exactly what the two tracks will sound like which is unfortunate of a release that is half what youd expect and half what you wouldnt
following a sudden deluge of soundcloud demos his first us gig in eight years and a cutting edge field day set that left many open mouthed richard d jamess latest curveball landed when 40 rare or unreleased tracks hit the internet in neat downloadable bundles most were bonus cuts tacked onto the end of classic albums but there was one new ep which collected four tracks that originally surfaced on user48736353001s soundcloud page in 2015 theres a nice story behind the first two: shortly after the release of s sorry i make you lush lp as wagon christ in 2004 future magazine ran a remix competition that james entered (under the pseudonym tahnaiya russell) and won i had an advantage james wrote in 2015 i knew better than most what liked shows james in various mesmerising modes on the first of two versions of he lifts the shimmering arpeggios from s sci fi and crafts an exquisite slice of light footed acid its punchy yet mellow all gentle 303s gauzy melodies and layers of organic drums that duck and dive at will given the current taste for breaks and breezy synths it could be a late summer hit theres not much between this and b except that the latters shorter by a minute and noticeably quieter ( because the sub is so loud and low wrote james ) pacy boisterous and cheeky is as we know him best again its the drums that impress after dozens of listens i still get goosebumps the moment the lead jungle break thunders in at 43 seconds but for all the eps percussive weight its standout track is the beatless the synergy between the scampering synths up top and the bassy swell below is utterly enchanting stirring up feelings that are best captured in jamess own language: liferush
after re-launching this year with a familiar-sounding ep by newcomer lance neptune lones magic wire label has tapped another artist who deals in bright and jazzy house music canadian producer patrick holland whos best known as may not have an especially unique style but his carefree energy is charming thats what made i want believe stand out in the jam-packed 1080p catalog and it defines as well anyone looking for some kind of evolution or curveball from these four tracks will be disappointed but then again thats not the point holland has an expert producers light touch and knack for details highlight is a prime example of this: just a slight offbeat thump of the kick drum or a couple extra notes snuck into the bass riff for one measure really make the tune feel alive twittering digital synths are another calling card and are once again used to great effect their dayglo shine giving loungey grooves like a retro-futuristic tint save for the brief and beatless which closes with some soulful rhodes chords hollands expectedly warm and shimmying house fare remains in fine shape on this ep with any luck hell pack a surprise or two into the next one
whenever come up with a release people sit back and listen this time is the latest concoction and as one would suspect it has that classic vibe to it the la coruna mix flows very nicely with a smooth bassline driving the production the spanish vocal line gives the track an enticing feel as does the subtle electro melodic riff that is the heart and soul to the production the parallel sound edit has a smooth feel to it a nice deep bassline the focus alongside a gritty electro main riff some smooth piano lines add a delicate touch to the mix resulting in a pretty good effort overall from parallel sound
may get a lot of attention for the old-school inflection he brings to his tunes particularly those he produces with neville watson ut on strahil velchevs latest for rush hour hes gone full-on epic albeit with the sort of admirable restraint that makes the tune that much sweatier eginning with a muffled oddly shaped guitar loop churning over a solid kick the track starts slowly as its percussion expands and strings infiltrate you know its only a matter of time before really takes aim at our gut still im not sure you can prepare for the sort of explosion were treated to: like a fireworks display remembered from childhood its oversized nostalgia-tinged and deeply affecting never overplays his hand though while a vocal-free dub is provided youll undoubtedly want to go with the main version s overlayed coos provide some much-needed sweetness to an otherwise fiery combination by comparison seems content to keep to the sidelines sampled train sounds and drums that mimic them dominate the mix giving the track a vibe better suited to travel between gigs than for the shows themselves still a hefty low-end makes the thing ripe for a blast on a good system its a -side if ever there was one just as you couldnt imagine anywhere other than front-and-center
the four tracks on sound design vol 1 which date back to 1992 wouldnt sound out of place in a dj set in maybe its just a good remastering job or maybe its that legions of producers are imitating this very style to a tee but then todd terry was always a master of his form sound design is a short-lived alias of terrys and while these tracks might not command the most respect in his catalogue they may well gain a new life through clones ongoing reissue series that highlights his freeze imprint theres something loose and limber about these tracks that sets them apart from modern iterations the rigid groove of searchin is pried open by its larry levan-esque hand percussion so that its almost floaty while the catchy vocal is contrasted by harshly processed horns has a relaxed feel to its jazzy stride not even its indelible screeching sample can ruin the mood is feverish in comparison with a jogging beat reinforced by steel mallets and incensed diva howls it shows how classic house could be both brash and earnest centering on a simple command make the beat pound and not doing much with it is the smallest revelation here but then reissuing sound design vol 1 wasnt meant to shed light on long lost gems rather its a reminder of how prominent houses roots remain and more importantly how little their impact has diminished through the years
there are plenty of producers out there who are doing similar things to rendan gregoriy k but few seem to be able to imbue it with quite as much feeling even a track like which is basically big-room techno at its gaudiest and most v th-like writhes with the sort of emotion that separates the wheat from the chaff is a master builder a producer that knows how when to add when to pull back and when to let it all hang out for that latter option wins out deetron fresh off a sterling fuse mix pops in for remix duties turning the techno banger original into a stomping screaming rework that gets just as epic deetron adds an organ line and a bassline that descends every bar t more than nine minutes its radio slave-worthy in length and temper and should fit nicely into any set that happens to have hypnosis as its raison d tre
in the last few years artists experimenting outside the confines of club genres have received a considerable boost in attention veronica vasickas label minimal wave deserves credit for the renewed influence of post-punk new wave and ebm on current dance music the resultant freaky cross-pollination of genres thats become de rigueur spurns the dance floor as much as it bows to its rhythmic demands doug lee is known for disco rather than contemporary club music which might explain the slinky funk of this brief but bristling 7-inch for minimal wave sub-label kino-i opens with a manic drum machine thump cid lines wiggle frenetically and as lee stacks layers of discordant machine sounds the pressure builds so much its as if the track is about to split apart fter about a minute of fried frayed-sounding electronics the breakdown is particularly satisfying but even as kino-i settles into a groove the prevailing mood is one of chaos like dance music thats been chewed up and spat out drum-heavy beats edit draws out the originals more abrasive qualities while the supercharged bassline is the focal point of the dub version compared to the original mix both feel a bit stern and functional but then most tracks would compared to the rampant orgy of machine love that is
londoner has been one of the cornerstones of cambridges label thus far veering between dubstep and tough garage and even electro incorporating live instruments and other deft touches is his third album overall and first for the label and shows off a confident and varied production hand with tempos ranging from 106 to 150 beats per minute s sound is dark and paranoid thc haze clinging to the steel and sinew that make up these beats opener and title track lays down the theme pretty well: rigid percussion oscillates with a downswing into murky lfo wobbles accented with chimes bits of string and a manipulated autotuned south asian singer it recalls equally the sinogrime experiments of dusk down and the newer work of lhf a vision of london thats all dark corners imagined harems and other seedy dens of iniquity its all over the album just listen to the ominous flutes on or the indian string instruments that paint themselves all over jetsam array of detuned and broken string instruments and other techno-exoticism that chooses is reminiscent of nine inch nails fragile (if you know mark has been made from that album its not a bad starting point for the sound palette of ) pendulum swing of feels nearly obsessive-compulsive especially as it sounds like hes forcefully plucking guitar strings right off the neck one by one one-two punch of distorted drums on is pure 90s pop-industrial but despite all the analogues we might affix to it you could probably fit in some trip-hop in there too feels curiously free of the current bass music narrative you wont find much experimenting with house rhythms here instead the album presents us with a post-human world of industrial decay and rusting machines whats left when we leave our music to the devices of automation its not always friendly but possesses an attractively alien allure all the same

fter remixes for us and ninja tune laurie osborne and kieran komonazmuk lomax (now operating as komon for house-related endeavors) pair up again on osbornes this release is apparently the result of a studio jam and both inclusions steer to the left-of-centre is seven-minutes of bumping house loaded with jump-up hooks and deep contrasting stabs on the other hand is a lower-slung boogie cut steeped in 80s new wave nostalgia rich in texture and clarity it bears a similarity to gary numans later productions and while it doesnt do a great deal does showcase the pairs ability to switch things up
has always displayed the urge to break things his breakthrough single quartz was grime shattered like a pane of glass its forms rendered (even more) fractured and angular even by his standards though is tough-going as its title suggests the ep is best understood as the sound of heavy machinery dancing; whirrs bleeps and punishing metallic concussions marshalled into obtuse rhythmic forms its not exactly an unfamiliar sound palette these days with young grime producers exploring ever more alien sonics and the metallic textures of jam citys classical curves looming large but in pushing this conceit so far transcends this context if anything his cryptic rhythms and lacerating percussion bring to mind the algorithmic workouts of autechre as with that warp twosome the best tracks here are poised on a knife-edge between knotty abstraction and a sly buried funk (though in this case of course the template is not hip-hop but grime) and are the most successful in this regard the formers enormous squarewave bassline marking a neat line of continuity with s past work elsewhere however the momentum sags way s slinky groove soon disintegrates in a squall of twisted metal is very satisfying but from that point on its a case of diminishing returns s opening gasped breaths meanwhile suggest an injection of very human urgency but ultimately we get the opposite: a sparse inhuman racket impressive but rather unaffecting
marcus lambkins first new material for a year is a slice of hi-nrg disco nostalgia in the 70s/80s tradition of san francisco the hometown of its guest vocalist the raptures luke jenner nchored by a familiar df bass groove funk-filled organ nibs and tottering percussion jenner slinkily beckons the track towards its shouted peak with repeated proclamations of i think youll always want me / i think youll always want my love in eye-watering falsetto luke s remix dials down the originals hyperactivity a shade splaying the vocal over a hypnotic palette of analogue synth and drums before rising to an ecstatic crescendo german producer larse plumps for a more synthetic housey foundation for his remix achieving a similarly mesmeric effect
while we await s first release on tri ngle which announced his signing in january the bristol producer returns to throwing snows left blank imprint which he kicked off last may with the nylon sunset ep like that record divides its time between slow house and 130 bpm territory but the sound this time out is more diffuse forsaking the percussive bite of earlier tracks like ton and nylon sunset the title track which lopes along at a grudging 100 bpm picks up its chug from workshop and its crinkled high-end from ctress beginning with plangent drones and finishing with garbled funk licks is a fleet-footed tribute to moodymann with its stacked harmonies set against a ruminative bassline and skipping hi-hats; again theres a strange undertow that bends its arc down into the murk as sounds modulate and drums corrode less than three minutes long is a haze of down-sampled drums and dub delay skeletal garage smeared into an ambient scrim
is an outlier his early grime-influenced s earned him a place in the experimental club scene but he doesnt have much in common with it anymore hes patient (this is his first record in two years) doesnt care much for dance floor dynamics and admires composers more than producers only emphasizes these outsider qualities the new york artist made his own synths for the new ep which gives it a painstaking level of detail taking the palette of experimental club music skittery drums thick synthetic textures bright melodies and sending it through what sounds like a million different processes is a dense record that builds on inbox island his last ep in unexpected ways some styles on are more recognizable than others the bright filaments of synth on recall artists like dark0 but the textures are squishy and thick delights in pulling apart the sounds he generates and revealing the granular makeup beneath the results can be ugly ( ) pretty ( ) or both at once ( which pairs a violent kick drum with a esy melody) on the eps most straightforward track he uses what sounds like a cough as the main percussive device feels less of-the-moment than inbox island but its also less predictable than its predecessor only the sluggish opening track is anything less than captivating its a collection of experiments that pushes further from conventional club music
andrew flores aka is one of s signature artists his rubbed-raw house and techno nicely represents the arizona label having released a staggering amount of music through it so far flores appears on s first vinyl project the simultaneous release of eight records from artists like granite mask orgonon pit and somali extract a collection of no-nonsense dance tracks hints that the move into vinyl might see the label shifting towards more traditional dance floor sounds two of s four tracks dont have melodies and are aggressive drum workouts that feel as if they are lunging at you instead of pads or chords flores wrings texture out of percussion a flanger on some fun spatial tricks with rattling tribal percussion on the other tunes are more conventional but no less satisfying is a workhorse dub techno track with a crunchy kick drum while the jacking the eps most brutal moment spins itself into a tizzy with feverish drum programming and a deliriously repetitive bassline all four tracks on are dead simple busted out with a simplicity that shouldnt be confused with inexperience flores knows what djs need and his first vinyl release for proves he can deliver it without sacrificing the labels rough-around-the-edges spirit
what do you get when you stir up old-school house nu-skool breaks squeaks bleeps and lots o sirens trouble soup that s what ts is italian stallions santos and madox and it s a match so sweet they deserve their own gustavo santoalalla theme these guys have been major players in the breaks scene for some time now: santos sabot and its evil nine remix featured on comps by hyper and james lavelle while madox is best known for smells like naples off the plumps saturday night lotion comp from last year as trouble soup they housed up slyde s vibrate to this last year and y4k marks their first compilation as a dj duo y4k fans treated to a broad swath of compilations last year by djs such as ali b evil nine nubreed and dj icey will be surprised to hear what is easily the housiest installment in the series yet but you shouldn t be disappointed as this disc ratchets up the energy level to 11 right off the bat and doesn t loosen its chokehold for a full 78 minutes trouble soup kick-start their y4k into motion with the mike monday remix of ourhouse s dropout it s a breaksy-housey combo that trumps the original and serves as a solid warm-up the pair whip out the big guns at track three with their acid house touch-up of tayo acid rockers shorty the pimp they then turn their scalpels to todd terry s 1988 barn-burner can you party trimming most of its dated elements but leaving in the diva samples drum machine and sirens - the first but certainly not last to appear in the mix i can think of about a hundred djs who would ve mucked up this remix but santos and madox don t take themselves too seriously and have tweaked can you party into a goofier good time even twenty years later and what better way for trouble soup to follow up todd terry one of the godfathers of house than with their own filthy tribute to the genre s epicenter via chicago the second half of the album is ushered in with the twisted electrofunk of madox s le plaisir analogique which sounds like 100 atari arcade systems going to war dave clarke s the wiggle (madox re-rub) is a welcome subwoofer stomper and while i prefer the more wicked original trouble soup do a fine job of housifying slyde s vibrate to this the sirens then return with a vengeance in trouble soups appropriately titled enjoy the sirens which after seven-plus minutes had me wondering if these guys got together based on a mutual love for ambulances the poonisher not a porn video but a breaks producer closes it all out with the stunt a breaks stormer that could only be improved by hearing it on a massive club sound system instead of my puny ipod headphones trouble soup were a surprise pick compared to the recent slate of breaks mainstays that distinctive have called on for its venerable y4k series but their mix proves it was an inspired choice house is the main course with only four straight-up breaks tracks in all but this shouldn t come as a surprise to those who ve followed y4k now into its sixteenth installment evil nine s volume 13 had almost as much house while dj icey s volume15 featured primarily house melodies but with a breaks foundation breaks purists might disagree with the increased shift to 4/4 but the trouble soup brand of house is real tasty this coming from someone who normally can t stand the stuff santos and madox have served up the most exciting y4k since phil k souper from start to finish
swedish artists tom lagerman and niklas janzon give beats in space its best 12-inch in a while with s the duo have come some ways since their remarkable 2014 debut eschewing the distorted homespun jam sessions of their first two records for a sharper sound hardware and live improvisation are still at the core of and but the clean tones and spacious mixing allow each cosmic house groove to cut straight to the dance floor nd when coupled with frisky drum work rich melodicism patient composition and a taste for peak-time levity this clear-headed approach creates powerful moments bears some similarities to lagerman and janzons norwegian neighbors like lindstr ms early singles or even the whimsical dynamism of todd terje its in the synths more than anything climbing and skipping arpeggiations lush pads that evoke warm getaways light-footed basslines with just a dusting of funk but thats not to underplay the kind of swaggering disco rhythm that underpins or the percussive frenzy that lights the title track ablaze s a whole this 12-inch marks a new level of quality and intensity from
is by far the best music snoop ggs made in a decade thats surprising as lately the d-o-double-g has been more concerned with hawking his routinely awful films and merchandise than with making tracks a short list of the worst offenders includes the unfunny stoner comedy mac devin to high school the reality show snoop ggs fatherhood and a smoke-able book of song lyrics (ok that ones kind of cool ) by far the crumbiest venture was reincarnated a vice -sponsored descent into cultural clumsiness cod reggae and mind-melting skunk a crisis of identity no one needed or wanted but any criticism of snoops work is perfunctory when you consider its financial success his snoopify app alone makes 30 000 a week through the sale of virtual merchandise the priciest of which is a 100 lden spliff cash has always been snoops m o but before it seemed like making decent music had been cut out of the business plan if theres one thing that makes s success less surprising its the presence of mon g riddick better known as d m-funk since a video of snoop freestyling over one of riddicks dj sets appeared on youtube in 2011 it was clear any collaboration between the two would be something to savour the american artist has been making music since the late 80s with little commercial success so its heartening that his music will now reach an international audience d m-funks love for 80s electronic funk is palpable his tracks drip with george clinton roger troutman and slave influences the very music that powered snoops debut and altogether best album ggystyle the end result sees snoop retreading old ground but in the context of his recent creative dry spell thats no bad thing he even confessed in an interview that working with riddick brought his knack back thats hard to deny lyrically offers little to muse on snoops mainly concerned with discussing how funky he is and what a good time hes having s largely free of the misogyny and gangsterisms that have defined his past work not surprising given hes a married man and a multi-millionaire his role is largely to add texture to riddicks impressively colourful beats almost the same job that george clinton played when parliament were at their most improvised and raw are plenty of standout tracks on the album but perhaps the best is a perfect blend of slippery synth bass sci-fi funk and nonsensical raps (the primary hook has to do with snoops footwear) like most of the album it has a feeling of spontaneity often missing in contemporary rap music and its all the better for it
phillip has had his fingers in quite a few pies over the last decade or so whether solo as brontosaurus christian bei wenger as arto mwambe or gerd janson as tuff city kids the frankfurt artist gets around in 2012 he showed a knack for fleecy house and balearic rock his first album on running back phillips a well-rounded selection that ran the gamut from wide-eyed balearic ( 70000ac ) to electro rock ( frontex slowfox ) and star-blind kosmische ( sandalscene ) phillips was an aptly-assembled series of nostalgia-inspired tracks that jelled nicely on the full-length format for his second album makes a lateral move from running back to for the cheekily-titled for the most part those seeking the retro joys of phillips will be pleased opener its ringing synth and hazy distant vocoder evokes 70s and early 80s film soundtracks but its soft sadness quickly gives way to the spring-green of beneath humid pads and another vocoder exercise again shows s reverence for the early 80s the title track takes this playfulness to the next level its slow-paced bass warped choral melody and codeine-dub ambience reebs atop a new order bassline and twinkling keyboard melody is one of the albums most endearing recreations of classic synth pop (minus the vocals) several vocal tracks stall the records giddy mood-play featuring resembles the dirt-under-the-nails disco that italians do it better have mastered but out that labels knack for sounding both elegant and gutter-broke s vocals on are more effective used as textural contrasts to s entwined synth lines but its the depeche mode-lite of singer on that grinds against the albums sequencing this is an odd stylistic gaffe from a producer whos already proven himself so adept at combining tracks into a work easily enjoyed from beginning to end but its to s credit that these minor complaints feel like just that for the most part is yet another lp designed to soundtrack summer events coolers waiting to be emptied

h dub techno arguably the most maligned of all dance music genres still that wont stop such ardent practitioners as detroits luke from continuing to turn out his super deep takes on the style ut should it on this release alone the conclusion is surely no: his rework of s original is as propulsive yet pensive as they come the main framework is fairly standard a gently undulating bassline and spacious kicks but the details are what keep you engaged ll around the groove is a scratched imperfect sonic canvas that sounds just like old super 8 films look the original is couched even deeper in its own liquid boom-tis lines pushing through an underwater world of swirling unseen tides and warm churning currents without the slightest sense of friction
on disc two of the deep love ep we see another original production by the israeli boys as well as a greek flavour with the g-pal remix of deep love sweety is the third and final production by the on this ep and it is quite special nice eerie effects ring in the track throughout as subtle synths holler from time to time a nice rumbling base keeps the track moving until a symphony of smooth melodies takes the track to new heights classic here and a great way to start this 2nd disc off on the flip is g-pal s unforgettable mix of deep love unforgettable is probably a great way to describe it as it has the smooth deep drums and flow of a trademark g-pal production beautiful summer vibes ring throughout while the vocal works exceptionally well with its surroundings it s yet again another outstanding production by the greatest progressive producer to come out of greece the better of the two discs for me with two exceptional tracks when you have two great tracks out of israel and greece respectively you know the progressive scene is well and truly thriving
more long snappy electro-house from colognes franke and more daybreak his recent nightexpress for flash recordings found him trying out novel chord patterns on three strong tracks but for his spectral debut hes returned to his debut my best friend hit itself a suave germanic take on blue monday where the earlier version (or versions - go upstairs did the same) aimed low dark and bleak is all candy-floss glee and sugar overload peter hooks bassline is doused in e and sprinkled with confetti but amid the french house surge and dizzying neon rush he stills finds time for a hint of melancholy trades the stomp and swoon for tidy taps and tame blips here and there dunked in deep pools of processing but not enough to work the finale plonks a two-chord ditty out on cheesy synth patches while a gruff bassline groans and telephone tones chime - almost wacky enough for areal but too overtly repetitive and simplistic for that lot stick to the a and everybodys happy

the title of zach sagniaws new ep as well as the comments the michigan-born artist provided with it could be taken as attempts to deflect expected criticism first off saginaw is at pains to map out what has been occupying his time since 2013s breakthrough lp no better time than now before saying of intermission : i havent found the next step for me yet ive been making loads of music as always but im still looking for that concrete new path it suggests that sagniaw is a little worried about his artistic progression but such are his talents that the sound of him failing to focus is still enjoyable as ever with a record percussion is central to intermission save for and two beatless boards of canada-esque interludes that waft in and out during the eps midsection is essentially two separate tracks: it begins as ambient before the second part elbows in with a grainy kick-drum stomp all three are pleasant or intriguing sometimes both but they mostly underscore the image of an artist groping for a direction opener is the standout and as the records most fully-formed track its also likely intermission s raison detre it lives up to the metronomic title for several minutes before gently falling out of time all while weaving theremin-like pads around the clicks and twinkles and are different sketches that come from the same base with the former adding abstract hip-hop touches to the latters warm hum and music box chimes with all of intermission s variety fans will likely find something to enjoy as they look forward to saginaw relaxing into his next path
what are the chances that dj is a joni mitchell fan pretty good id say not because his music sounds anything like her but i cant hear his precisely calibrated spray of hi hats and not think of the title of her album the hissing of summer lawns thats true once again with his remix of the italian duo s the original released earlier this year on romanias is a low end intensive acid house jam whose main feature is its juke inspired vocal sampling a firehose strength stream of syllables dj flips the script entirely reducing both the voices and the bassline to a burbling hint of tone buried deep in the mix; the main action is in straight ahead hi hats and ride cymbals a steady shimmer of 16th notes the closer you listen the more you become aware of the complex patterns just beneath the surface as dry rimshots and handclaps answer in pitter pat rhythms like some kind of syncopated morse code its math made dreamlike kassem takes a similar approach in his remix of by genoas hissing 909 hi hats are run through delay and sprayed across the stereo field with piano and bass counterpoints setting a mood suggestive of a hazier roman fl gel like s remix its deceptively simple creating something dark and rich out of meager materials
has been a force in the uk scene for seven years reliably churning out quality tracks while never staying on a label too long if hooking up with means a bassier sound whats not to like oth tracks on dont feature slow techno-like build-ups and arrangements with space to play out over about eight minutes -side dont is the kind of 130 pm-plus dubstep creeper that would have made classic-era martyn proud with an added erlin-school hypnotism -side may sound unassuming at first but it soon transitions into a crossbred techno banger with delirious synth strobes over housey handclaps e m sound effects strangulated vocal snips industrial clangs and the kind of bass groove you might expect from detroit is astute in his choice of sounds especially in the use of dynamic range each side has an affection for earworm zaps in the high-end and low-end their interplay is joyous
one would imagine that being as far removed from the hubs of contemporary electronic innovation as possible is no good thing yet australian eugene hector an outsider in almost every sense of the word uses his antipodal position to great effect; amalgamating influences from every part of the globe he crafts schizophrenic meandering tracks that manage to mystify and delight simultaneously operating under multiple aliases he experiments radically with form as well as matter to his hearts (dis)content it therefore comes as no surprise that his latest offering on trilogy tapes is his most unclassifiable work yet the instant point of comparison is actress; both artists employ dichotomous aural elements in novel ways composing off-kilter sonic structures that fundamentally shouldnt work if only because the songs feel like they could unravel at any second hector doesnt hesitate to veer off from the highway which only adds to this effect the sounds stumble along drunkenly yet somehow still sound incredibly lucid and alive a schizophrenic mix of pitched-up monosyllabic ramblings snapping snares and dissonant synths the title track is perhaps the best illustration of hectors unique combinations of juke and deranged r b sampling even the four-to-the-floor reworking of the song offers only temporary stability a familiar respite which is constantly undermined by the chirping vocals and distracted instruments likewise the sublimely chaotic call-and-response on the otherwise serene conjures up images of a fantastic hip-hop gospel it is entirely to hectors credit that he can synthesize so many disparate elements into a cohesive whole of course with so much musical terrain being explored at once any coherent flow is almost impossible to achieve; is a series of exploratory sketches rather than a conclusive and fully articulate work even so careys work thrives on impatient adolescence and perpetual movement so while these compositions sound anything but childish it is precisely in the restless immaturity that the power of the work resides
robert 3d del naja did a fine job of manning on his own sure 100th window was a tad austere and not quite on par with previous albums but could you imagine trying to follow up mezzanine solo besides now that 3d and daddy g are reunited in studio again you can quickly tell what has been missing with gs absence not quite soul per se del naja proved that he could craft soul without daddy g on 2006s live with me but something more obscure a chemistry that can only come from a shared history of many years s title track has a sluggish ragga beat consisting of a lethargic horn surrounded by eerie synths daddy g plods along caught in a druggy rhyme while horace andy coos a (political ) plea to avoid some kind of pending apocalypse: its easy dont let it go dont lose it a little less paranoid but similarly gloomy shows off s knack a winning collaboration this time with tunde adebimpe of tv on radio fame adebimpe turns in an airy per mance as drums roll a piano mourns and knecks crane to sky rain but as gloom builds into a powerful crescendo it suddenly breaks out into an unexpected sunshower of hope and praise be e descending back into depths once again future classic stuff inhabiting second half of ep are remixes of two thcoming tracks courtesy of van and flash which serve as possible insight as to what se cuts may sound like in ir original shape mer is a bit gettable but latter is a brilliant piece of spooky electronica that features trickys girl martina topley bird waxing gothic over a malignant acid line if original turns out as ominously good as treatment flash gives it n were in something pretty darn special when lp5 drops early next year
collection not only brings together twelve of m a n d y s high profile remixes but also continues get physicals apparent quest for world domination patrick bodmer and philipp jung the men behind the mask and co owners of get physical can seemingy do no wrong at the moment slipping easily between genres adapting to anything they choose along with label mates shade and t they have helped to manouevre get physical into a position where it is fast approaching kompakts mythical status for one like seeing projects such as these come off with aplomb and m a n d y s meteoric rise over the past five years has been achieved without compromise which is always to be admired collection does in many ways reflect patrick and philipps eclecticism but it would be a mistake to suggest that the remixes themselves fall into that category for while a diverse collection of artists are present variety is not this collections calling card but therein lies its strength for while m a n d y s production style is immediately evident throughout and relatively uniform from track to track this allows the original artists to shine serving to emphasise where the inspiration came from in the first place stars of the show include (which evoked a lot of hazy memories for yours truly) nto and sound in evidence here is that of very polished electro house with a healthy low end and theres a range and confidence implicit in this work that is truly on a par with the best pop producers around moreover the ambition in assembling a collection like this is almost tangible listening to it again and again it could almost be an artist album but its a bit better than that due to the absence of anyhing remotely resembling filler or over indulgence rule of thumb with the majority of compilations is that theyre uneven affairs flawed by their scope not so this ts a grower too ll be honest and say that didnt appreciate the mastery at work for the first few listens but it reeled me in and got me thinking that the only thing that can screw m a n d y up at the moment is becoming victims of their own success
unleash the talents of russian producer the for their 4th release and he in turns repays the faith with three innovative production in his venus turns up the heat a little with some more intense 4/4 beats and a more conventional melodic progressive cut the track again features some slight ethnic vocal samples and a smooth but subtle baseline but if melodic progressive may be your thing then this will definitely please playing features some pretty nice beat patterns and again the mood and aura to the production are quite smooth and melancholic the baseline is quite nice in this production giving the track a good flow and the smooth string patterns deep into the track push into a trancey arena quite a good release showing that all corners of the world produces great talent
is anyone actually listening to minus anymore or are we just content to make fun of them blindly and leave it at that those choosing to remain secure in the knowledge that nothing good could come from something richie hawtins hands any longer are missing out jplss masterful album from late last year was hugely underrated while the imprints singles in have reflected the fruits of the post-minimal landscape that each artist on the label is trying to traverse s response to all of this is baby steps plays with minimal techno techniques but its vocal tics which resemble how its title can twist the innocuous help it stand apart so does it liquid bassline meanwhile sounds like classic-era perlon a polished bit of mind-melting techno that clocks in at a more -friendly tempo: 122 bpm may sound a bit like what its title suggests a simple beat worked out for six minutes for no particular reason but redeems it as its full of the sort of personality drops synthesized grunts a freaky aqueous lead line that lacks last but certainly not least is which takes the watery theme and extends it further into highly musical territory wherein showcases his tech house side to fascinating effect listen closely to this one you may be surprised
this is s fifth release for moshi moshi so far and it finds them sticking to the same line theyve been following since their first releases on highpoint lowlife and infrasonics: tight jacking house and k garage with an unapologetically classic bent you couldnt call it retro theres a sharpness to s sound that separates the music from its inspirations from a decade or two ago but thats also an integral part of the groups aesthetic: their choppy vocal samples sound like theyve been cut with a diamond-tipped blade while their staccato stabs have a pristine digital feel all four cuts are essentially variations on the same theme juggling piano chords squelchy stabs snippets of string ostinato swinging drum patterns and a whole mess of todd edwards-style vocal shots member benz remix of the title track is darker deeper and more rolling than the original offering a nice counterpoint to the tracks slightly manic energy theyre all serviceably high-energy party tracks but theyre missing that extra something to elevate them to the caliber of similar tunes like moscas bax and done me wrong ; a little more focus on memorable hooks might be a good starting place

close the curtains light the black candles and draw a pentagon on the floor s last album has just arrived thats probably an exaggeration the new album from miles whittaker and sean canty the third and final in a series vinyl-only long players released this year doesnt make as many explicit references to witchcraft and black magic as the duos 2009 but symbiosis however the same eerie supernatural un rcurrents as well as a fascination with ath cay and well the darker si the human psyche are all present and correct opening track sets the tone perfectly: featuring nothing more than a low end hum it emits the occasional crackle to let the listener know that some kind life form is controlling it if hints at the grey zone between our world and the supernatural then represents something more grisly as layered chanting and frenetic drums soundtrack the preparations for an assassination from there onwards the tempo reverts to ad pace but the mood remains the same is full wobbly bass and noisy fx like the way the chitter-chatter an approaching group people reverberates across a walled yard while plays on the same i a ambient noise building as half-heard voices mutter in the background despite this love found sounds and field recordings there are some concession towards musicality: which starts with the same electric hum as morphs into something approaching a downtempo melancholic techno track its atmospheric chords making it sound like a ghostly cousin t les sees the duo try their hand at freeform jazz with crashing drums and plinky plonk keys prevailing however these are only temporary steps out the (dis)comfort zone and seem most comfortable when creating uneasy listening soundtracks like or the ath-march dirge like a baby with a sixth finger or a bear d lady are out on their own a freakish curiosity for sure but one that invites inquisitive ears and questioning listeners
as dave huismans started out fusing techno and dubstep and that sound is still audible in his music on his fourth album the dutchmans rhythms are as ever heavyweight and razor-sharp with pitch-black bass frequencies that glower with real intensity mastered by rashad becker for maximum impact sounds cavernous yet with rare exceptions such as this is anything but a dance floor album sketched out during six weeks in york during which time huismans drew on a cache of obscure post-punk new age and early synth records for inspiration channels intentionally or not the boundary-breaking spirit of no wave and the early 80s manhattan art-funk scene not in a faithful homage but in a freewheeling way that defies easy categorisation the swirls of distortion that underpin may hark back to the grey industrial fringes of punk-funk just as the dark disco of recalls that scenes interest in latin and african polyrhythms but after that hares off into wild uncharted scrubland bordered by the woody krautrock of james holdens the inheritors the psychedelic jazz of broken beat icons 4hero and brandt brauer fricks conservatoire techno the results are as bleak as they are beautiful a funereal slice of high drama drumcell sounds like andy stott soundtracking an avant-garde theatre production of macbeth an insistent thrum of beats and vibrating piano bass chords it builds with a chest-crushing force that sucks the air from the room is underpinned by a similar percussive insanity and yet it begins to leak warm liquid chords which eventually envelop the track turning it into something profoundly serene not all of a today reaches those heights but huismans is really stretching the possibilities of where his sound can go this is a serious knotty work and its a pleasure to untangle
theres no doubt that pariss underground scene is on the rise these days but its important to remember that its always been there and that its given us lots of great music over the years the trio behind (dan ghenacia shonky and dyed soundorom) are a product of this environment and for their labels fourth release they remind us of their citys heritage by unearthing one of its classics: a punchy deep house track by local luminary dj gregory produced under the name g is the first cut off on the raw gain a 1998 ep that fetches something north of 100 euro on discogs these days scroll down past the discouraging price and youll see why its so dear to s hearts: much played at the time at dan ghenacias classic kwality afterparties at batofar on sunday mornings says one user the song is upfront simple and incredibly effective: a thick bassline that garage-style bounce dj gregory does so well and a wobbling sub-aquatic melody that combined with the occasional woooosh and bird chirp gives it all a dreamy afterhours sheen isnt the only decent track from on the raw gain but it is the only track on this single-sided record (cue a sigh of relief from anyone with the original ep) that shouldnt dim your view of the reissue is strong enough to stand up on its own thanks to this ones poised for a return to sunday mornings
t its best kevin martins project has beefed up the skank of dancehall with elements of dub and more recently dubstep and grime the formula paid off on 2008s london zoo one of the most fearsome hybrids to emerge from the uk dubstep explosion fter five years and countless singles martin finally returns to his chief alias for a new album of which is our first taste with two of martins toughest productions each presented in two versions (inna true soundsystem style) its a testament to just how much a vocal can change a tune fuck that is murky funktion-one goes which has become a mini-anthem vocalist isnt lying when he says murky doused in reverb the tracks zombie-like horn riff explodes in lurches druging up bass and sending it through the mix like a mudslide and team up on the same beat for turning s social anxiety on its head its a kinky sex jam that sets s rambunctious raps against s dream-pop navelgazing the other side is given over to another simplistic beat with exploding snares that sound straight out of early skream productions addy bellows fearsomely over but again its who makes the most of the beat commanding we need it louder while he darts around a minefield of explosive percussion these might not be martins most envelope-pushing beats but its hard to think about that when the walls are violently shaking
if you cant join em beat em is the sophomore release from and is the follow up to his much lauded album music for the mature b-boy from 2003 format is notorious for his fascination with classic breakbeats utilising 70s funk basslines uptempo b-boy breaks turntablist scratches and comedic samples all held together with an element of having fun and rocking the dancefloor as with mature b-boy format once again teams up with canadian mc abdominal and his buddy d-sisive and also jurassic 5 mcs chali 2na and akil abdominal and d-sisive demonstrate why they are an mc team to be reckoned with as they feed off each others energy and more importantly creative rhyme styles on tunes like the opening tune 3 feet deep and also separated at birth which sees the two mcs through the similarities of their styles have formed a brotherhood demonstrated in verse format lays down a wicked black psychedelic rock guitar riff combined with lethal b-boy breakdowns and a scratch break by format abdominal features in solo tunes such as the upbeat and crowd moving participation prerequisite which sounds like a direct continuation of the hit song from mature b-boy on top of a funky hammond laden rhythm abdominal takes it back to when mcs need skills period flow and control intellect and wit he then delivers comedy rhyme stylings on how he and format lament about being the ugly sibling on ugly brother - empathise for someone who believes he was given a crappy hand in the genetic lottery jurassic 5 mcs chali 2na and akil worked with format on we know something you dont know on mature b-boy and they return for the place as fans of j5 have come to expect the two mcs deliver feel good lyrics harmonising vocals as format lays down a funky guitar-and-bassline-in-unison riff with well placed cuts and scratches for good measure its not all about mc based tunes format originally made his name with instrumental b-boy breaks and he showcases his skills on tunes like the piano plonking the turning point with a bassline and horn arrangement reminiscent of 70s blaxploitation funk it almost sounds like a live performance with format on the 1s and 2s cutting up samples during the scratch break black cloud is a much more laidback effort and harks back to slow rocking 70s rock tunes featuring a moody vocal sample catchy bassline riff soundtrack style strings and a funky guitar lick heavy on the wah-wah format has definitely improved since the last album and if you cant join em definitely has a flow to it - the mcs introduce themselves in the opening tune and worked to express brand new lyrical content with each tune what i also liked about this album compared to the last one was the exclusion of skits that really werent too funny and in some ways got annoying with the last release this is a really enjoyable album full of energy and definitely one for the b-boy/b-girl in all of us
back in 2013 david reynolds produced s first 12-inch devonian garden ith its scuffed melodies and ramshackle percussion it contained the elements that would later define the vancouver scene reynolds second e treads the same ground as his first but given how well those early records have held up its a pleasure to have him back f anything is even more chilled than devonian garden drums are little more than a light rustle leaving centre stage for robust bass wiggles and liquid keys is particularly winning its broad bassline and bouncing toms lit by dazzling synth tones these crystal melodies are smeared atop the gentle and left to echo unaccompanied on the beatless sketch which is tinged with the melancholy of summers end even on more muscular tracks like theres a meandering quality which comes from reynolds distinctive light touch
radioactive orchestra is ostensibly a project bettering our understanding of gamma radiation waves of energy emitted from inside the nuclei of atoms as they decay in practice though its basically a nifty online sound generator where radiation waves become musical ones thats more or less how the swedish label and a partner in the project has been using it axel boman the labels frontman recently recorded an albums worth of material using the projects sound generating algorithms he and the label invited users to submit music made with the radioactive orchestra for the chance of seeing it released on now a split 12 inch from winners (whos previously released on prologue) and newcomer the plus ace remixes from me and jonsson has made it on the shelves im admittedly not sure how to take a critical stance on the contest winners as education on nuclear safety is a valuable public service that should not be discouraged so well leave it at this: the winners especially the s almost sex tags ish got some commendably cool sounds out of the algorithms me are never short on interesting melodies and the wild yelps and muted synths that drive their epic take on carry plenty of them jonsson arent messing around either turning in a low key but driving slice of chilly ambient techno we may not be better prepared for a nuclear catastrophe but weve certainly got some big tunes on our hands
this debut 2cd effort from canadian duo brothers colin and justin moreh leaves me with a distinct feeling of ambivalence on one hand as expected this is an impeccably produced album showcasing s tight and distinctive style by and large a comfortable stroll through spacious melodic progressive breaks and house on the other hand however it s mind-bogglingly dated so dry and ordinary that it barely secured itself a second listen sporting an impressive discography and winning the thumbs-up of progressive circles quickly became trailblazers of the genre all the more reason why this albums uninspired pass musicality is a bona fide shock to the system admittedly it has its moments though spanning across two full discs that should be a given unfortunately the highlight of the first disc red cell doesn t come until the end: dream on is a classic triumph released as a single and an out-and-out club hit dream on delivers some much-needed quality to the proceedings with tight dynamic beats genre-defining trickling melodies and colin morehs own druggy atmospheric rem/underworld-style vocal the track rather frustratingly flaunts what the duo are capable of elsewhere mana reveals layers of heavenly silky melodies illustrative of the lps retrograde breaks sound that i melted to a year or three ago second disc white cell features remixes and collaborations with artists such as luke chable and david west overall it plays better than its partner chable ever on form delivers an outstanding peaktime remix of dream on while the furry nipples remix of face is well-executed contemporary techy house - succeeding with the trippy dark vocal where the original failed so this leaves me in a quandary: while not an appalling album by any means just falls short of the brilliance and originality i have come to expect from the brothers moreh although s consistent output of singles will undoubtedly keep them in the running this sub-par album will come as a disappointment to many
im not sure has ever fully gotten his due former new yorker (big apple residents of a certain persuasion still lament the passing of his mastering studio) continues to refine his mastery of sound from his adopted home of berlin but hes still not the household name his extensive discography and reputation as an engineer would suggest xavier doesnt seem as interested in the coolest and newest sounds as he is in those that are refined and advanced and thats precisely the sort of palate we get on featuring some spoken-word bits from george g-tech rontiris and remixes from dustin and longtime collaborator tony : minimally adorned thumps and clicks combine to form a whole a good deal heavier than the sum of its parts beginning like any number of records released on clink glides by on muted syncopated chords and a solid kick before dub atmospherics blast things off as youd expect no sound drifts out of place and theres really no weak moment in the mix remixes offering two different interpretations of peaktime slot xaviers original idea into a new context but wasnt exactly in need of this sort of expansion s remix does something a bit more interesting toughening up the original slightly while injecting enough spaciness to keep things from getting too heavy (a tool also included is more or less what the title indicates ) still xaviers original remains at the top of the pack a place many of us would love to see him more often
in the crowded electronic music scene its rare to find a corner so sparsely populated as the one calls home in fact its tempting to say that hes alone there his debut last years end of edge ep for going good was a swirl of competing currents: electronic loops against wild squalls of acoustic instruments hypnotic house-wise grooves versus de-centred psychedelia this year these currents appear to be separating summers forgetting curve ep on jinn went far far out (only to be pulled back to earth by a sotofett remix) asylum ep for itals label is more stable or so it initially appears a bouncy house beat declares as dance music but other moods are sprinkled on top: wonky swirls of piano and hand-drums wafts of birdcall mumbling voices some kind of twangy string instrument after the three-minute mark the groove ratchets up and firmer chords try to bring order to the proceedings but after a while they give up and with a few bars of queasy backmasked drums were back to the dazed cacophony of the opening b-side gets weirder again and are strange sepia-tinted piano pieces former sounds like a solemn serialist sketch played in an empty concert hall while the latter is prettier overlaid with strange skittish drum rolls hayashis best tracks stack their ideas more densely but these sparser ones still sound like little else out there
despite being just little more than 2007s sharpest tool the original mumblin has yet to lose its sheen either through excessive praise or dumbfounded criticism it still seems the quirkiest records of 2007 if not the most jaw-dropping this low-key charm makes it far more suitable for remixes than hit dance records usually are instead of the inevitable anti-climax of a few high-profile artists trying to make a big track even bigger this package on gives loco and marco the chance to add a new twist to one of the most downbeat low slung hits of the 00s first up is loco who smoothes out some of the edges of kabale und liebes original and adds some french kiss -style melodies while keeping almost the entire daniel sanchez vocal its no major overhaul but he does put his trance meets deep house stamp on mumblin and gives it a new lease of life in the process marco s remix meanwhile is even more low-key but largely disappointing turns a pretty straight-up house track into a boring one removing most of the vocal and practically all trace of melody in favour of more percussion and more bass ultimately its a gray-scale rework that owes nothing to the original that is except most of its future sales figures one worthwhile remix is definitely a disappointment for a track that seemed ideal for remixing but its better than none at all

jason letkiewicz is the sort of artist who revels in technos anonymity picking up a new name and a new game whenever it suits him he churns out funky house as malvoeaux and explores analog detroit darkness as half of two gs in a letkiewiczs third ep under his guise showcases a devoted exploration of the sound first pioneered by larry heard in 1986 in fact theres enough of a soundalike factor that at times it smacks of lost tapes from heards bottom drawer all your favorite first-wave chicago tropes are in full effect: the warm caress of an analog bubblebath those crunchy drums those silvery synths the flurries of handclaps melodies whose roll and wobble bear that human-played soul title cut has a strong dose of punchy snare rushes and melodic trade-off between plinks and pads and its follower is a close cousin while both a-siders are adroitly cut the records second half is arguably stronger where jason/steve allows himself a bit more breathing room a dark turn is taken on which true to its name invokes an android plagued by casio-colored hallucinations plonky 8-bit riffs fighting off spectral strings and some unholy circuit-skronk and the standout encapsulates why the record is a success: it doesnt turn towards classic sounds in order to follow in their footsteps but in order to feel the same pulse the same dreamy tug on the heartstrings
darko esser and ger lanings is an imprint that so far hasnt found much a place in bags techno purists but s most recent effort has a shot at changing that the dutchmans strength has always been an ability to craft legitimate peak-time cuts not fillers or tools something hes largely built his reputation upon as a producer sees him continue that trend the title track kicks release f with a raw and hazy midrange which chugs along until its paired with an upfront six-pronged bassline ultimately creating a warm backdrop to rachmads acid-tinged synth work its been made for heaving dance floors but its bass and daring percussion sets it apart from your straightforward peak-time fare flip vinyl over however and its a different story is basically -sides younger sibling lifted from same palette but lacking in strength while its a track with personality dont expect this one to come close to matching impact its predecessor note to o r labels: if youre lacking in erghain airtime give a call

three years on from his debut comes with a four-track 12-inch of spacey widescreen techno and shimmering dubby electronica opens up like some refugee from daft punks homework before quickly morphing into a deep driving dance floor destroyer theres a thrilling percussion coda that sounds like muller has opened up the studio door and found a thousand duracell bunnies outside clattering away at the cymbals scuttles along at first to a classic fidgety minimal-style beat before clipped hi-hats chime in eventually reaching a deliciously unholy climax of deathstar alarms and a skippety 4/4 rhythm is a somewhat schizophrenic but effective bubbling mass of frazzled synth brass that rolls and stumbles like a drunk at a wedding accompanying a barrelling groove that cracks on like a team of huskies four minutes in it begins its inexorable descent towards the breakdown culminating in an aural splash that sounds like a thousand electro cats being ray-gunned to death in an alley as if to rubberstamp mullers versatility closer for is an understated locked groove punctuated by dubby whooshes and swarms of droning keys that plays out to some sun-dappled air-style rhodes piano if muller can keep his focus bpc have quite a talent on their hands
samuel andr madsens sense of groove is so good that his tracks dont need melodies his most far-reaching tunes ( when the weeping stops descend to ascend ) are as stripped-down as house comes reasserting that keys or chord progression arent essential if the beats are right the danish producers upcoming dream state a bellmaker album however will need a melodic touch to make it worthwhile an eight-track collection of atmospheric drum tracks is a tough sell no matter how nice the patterns are but if a two-track album sampler indicates whats to come well see another side of madsen is madsen at his most expansive over 11 minutes long its vaguely tribal with an intense swinging drum pattern rattling underneath long atmospheric pads and a simple three-note bassline dreamy and pumping at once is the kind of tune that can put a late-hour dance floor in a blissed out-daze that is until the crowd erupts into cheers once the kick drum returns after a long breakdown a 12-inch version of sits on the a-side its a funkier option for djs with cosmic stabs and a cheery vibe were in for a treat if dream state a bellmaker has more tunes like these

portugals tiago mirandas was a watermark by anybodys standards he dropped no less than five singles and his group gala drop not only got praise from us but also landed a plum gig opening for panda bear in new york city in one calendar year tiago went from having his single motocycles carted around in james murphys gig bag to releasing his disambiguation single on dfa to cap it off miranda snuck in one last ep for lovefingerss label and it might be his finest showing yet subtitled in memory of dash snow miranda goes slow and sleazy here across four cuts is starts off with a boxy drum machine beat before adding shimmering keyboard lines layers of propulsive hand percussion and a guitar line that nearly hums pink floyds fearless all of it slithering deeper and deeper somehow (not an arthur russell cover) slows the beat down to an even more syrupy chug and its queasy echoing piano soon mingles with a brighter cascade of notes to great effect on the b-side theres the sun-kissed shuffle of with warm breezes of guitar blowing across it a balearic classic-to-be once the gray of winter melts away the beat seems to be foregrounded on but its soon shot through with echoing bass drops woodblock clops and a fuzzy melancholic melody its these subtle ways with a line of having each instrumental component further its development and deepen its mood that makes tiagos singles so intriguing each subsequent listen revealing more nuance no doubt hell be one to keep an ear attuned to this year as well
s music is remarkably unfussy and thats the secret to its success listen to found a place the most celebratory anthem ever to come out of signing a rental contract and its hard not to be envious on a well i could have done that level his latest for is similarly concise deep house music that focuses on the fundamentals rather than unnecessary adornment music cuts right to the chase throwing out a four note melody that will see things through to tracks end in the opening moments and gradually building things around a pumping propulsive beat the prophet is similarly cosmic in nature until a synth starts climbing and climbing and climbing until you simply cant hear it anymore it gives the slightly tougher tune a reach-for-the-stars quality that was lacking on music and the other tracks and nger which seem content to rock back and forth in place sometimes this works: nger is quick and pounding but thankfully too melodic to deliver on the promise of its title indeed the only track that doesnt quite hit is the title tune which gets lost the longer it goes on its a curious misstep from lionni though because the issue is that its overstuffed with ideas s he well knows simplicity can often be your best friend

since instra:mental split damon kirkhams followed a subtly different path to his former partner al boddika green both bring muscularity to their productions but kirkhams work as has been less rough and ready and showed him willing to experiment with deeper atmospheres admittedly idoru his first album as was slightly underwhelming lacking the focus a long-player demands but compared to his latest ep which smacks more of jamie jones than autonomic that record was laser-tuned according to a press release drinking cocktails in the sun on the beaches of hawaii and australia inspired theres no place for needling bass riffs in paradise it seems: instead this one fizzes with synths that sit somewhere between hall oates and hot creations the vocal which embodies the house tradition of sounding deep while being illogical ( tell me girl / to be with you / makes it feel / so real ) could push the track into tacky anthem territory but instead drags woozily against the beat stopping it from becoming an 80s pastiche his remix as kid ups the originals flickers of narcotic confusion by warping the vocal into unrecognisable shapes melodies that formerly sparkled fight their way through clouds of reverb as an exercise in 170 bpm balearic its a pleasant thing to get immersed in but the haziness is too indistinct to linger
marcus s remix didn t make much impact on fabriclive 36 last year but that s not necessarily the track s fault it s just that set side by side with a slew of stunning drum n bass tracks the merely great ones were doomed to fade into the background taken on its own is more than capable of leaving an impression oth and are rare among drum n bass producer/djs in that they can strike a near perfect balance of heavy and light elements on a track or between them s a producer manage this by intertwining soulful vocals with a crushing bassline ( e true being a good example) and as a dj makes silky smooth transitions despite surface disparities such as between the dreamy and jonny l s screw faced stormer come here on fabriclive the harmony among airy synths sharp claps rich bass and a tough as nails beat makes a perfect lynchpin for open minded dnb djs segueing out of soulful dnb into ruffer stuff as did or vice versa the track s only iffy addition is an oft repeating stab that sounds too much like a computer alert kicking in around the two minute mark and sticking around for the rest of the time this might only get irritating for some listeners however and others might not even notice it at all on the flip s is strictly for the jocks that like to keep a uniformly dark and techy vibe through the night pairs up well with recent hospital offerings like cyantific s disconnected or logistics glitch not only because they all have meaningless techno industrial names but also because they keep the lights low without ever really getting down n dirty ut aside from retaining s flair for dense layered bass has little in common with the consistent greatness of their call to mind artist album from last fall this one s strictly side material in one ear and out the other
this meeting of detroit acid veteran todd osborn and hot chips may seem like a curveball but on the formers first output as since 2009s hovercrafting they make for an intuitive and natural pairing is a simple yet charming concoction a foundation of warm unhurried bass complements a lilting high-pitched acid line that duets with s soulful vocal s s dub rework of doesnt fall far from the tree with some additional bass layers and osborns acid line replaced with chiming synth work not unlike that on bassline 12 from s recent taking over ep osborns solo outing is aimed far more directly at the dance floor an unbroken 4/4 kick and insistent all night vocal sample eventually open out with playful keys calling to mind long sweaty nights in warehouses gerd janson and phillip lauers remix as tuff anchors that vocal sample to a classic acid riff with stripped-back faintly cosmic results
follows the footsteps of markese with this next release on the imprint with a very nice two tracker including the title track is first up and it is a very nice moody production that builds with a deep rolling baseline and a series of effects and atmospheric elements that give the track a great aura and drive it s smooth and despite the fact it doesn t really change shape throughout it is a very good a-side to this release forinsee is on the flip and it is just as deep as the a-side thanks to some more deep baselines and a very quirky percussive pattern nice melodic bounces help build the track as well as a subtle synth line creating yet another great production by a very tasty release here on with two very intricate productions
the latest 12-inch on is it balearic owes as much to the oft-appropriated and sometimes-maligned metacontinent of balearia as it does to deep houses gravity and earnestness-bordering-on-fromage humberto matias one man social disco band presents a deep acidy ramped down house chugger in the vocal-less original the warmth of the guitars and flute bits are given some dramatic gravity against the slithering acid line (which is kept for all of the reworkings) this track is definitely looking backwards more than it is forward but it succeeds as his interest in specific sounds comes across as earnest in its efforts its not pastiche to cash in on a genre renaissance; its genuine attachment to a set of sounds attached to different times/movements and their re-configuring esoterians soft and lovefingers combine for the remix a version whose rangle-jangle saloon stomping layered guitars recalls the rub n tug remix of wild rumpus from a few years back there is a certain crazed density to the layers in this one and it feels less structured like a song and more like a car careening down some nightmare swamp backroads a nice diversion from the restraint of the original las pacific take the acid line and some horn parts from the original and take off on some beautiful vaguely mythological tour of annexia perfect for sundowns and sunups alike like most of their work ideas brood and compound for five or six minutes before the payoff is delivered but unlike many tracks that build this way it doesnt telegraph its destination from the outset it encapsulates the timeless bittersweet and fragile sides of balearic quite effectively finally swiss boys pharao contribute the accessible take that achieves the more obviously peaktime/tensnake-esque party fun time italo straightforwardness amidst the seriousness of the other cuts this one comes off refreshing and necessary as well the result is a thoroughly well-rounded ep with some really thoughtful remixes that would all play well throughout different phases of a balearic-disco-adjacent night in fact because its all instrumental and the remixes arent super derivative of the original you could probably get away with playing the whole thing without wearing out your welcome
earlier this year slipped out a techno ep for work them records that in contrast to his wonky past work almost sounded normal but it would be foolish to assume that this meant the producer real name daniel fisher was heading towards a more streamlined style (after all he once told ra that hed be sad if he was ever just producing two big-room techno singles a year ) true to form fishers latest ep ditches the metallic sheen of its predecessor in favor of swollen and rough-cut club tunes fisher has played with genre tempo and to an extent humor but this record gets its personality from a palette of massive sounds the title track is a boomy techno throbber full of bleepy sirens searing hats and a relentless kick but at the midpoint the whole thing is offset with soothing pads is slightly more oddball with its rough and fuzzy drum patterns pounding like a brigade marching through the streets what makes it eccentric is the climax after working itself up with defiant head-banging the track drops into an unexpected moment of silence on fisher rolls out his weirdest sounds so far turning rancid synths into a druggy but undeniably functional dance floor heater in other words once again thinking out of his own box
at its height cadenza was one of dance musics most cutting-edge labels it was known among other things for bringing a touch of latin flair to minimal house today ten years since it started the label runs more like a factory churning out groovy tech house eps in fact were it not for the return of lucianos - -luciano alias for the labels 100th release its possible the milestone wouldve passed by largely unnoticed discounting the two eps of retrospective material he released on baseac in 2014 this is the first new music weve heard from luciano in more than two years unlike the clobbering tech house of his dj sets and are charismatic minimal cuts a sound that has long been his forte just shy of 14 minutes the title track is a head-spinning roller its blend of slanted kicks baggy percussion and puffy synths giving it a camp charm b-side is more of a club weapon framing fevered glitches around the kind of no-nonsense one-bar loop that would have devastated the dc-10 terrace in its heyday as a dj luciano may have lost some of his magic but theres still something rattling around in his locker when it comes to making music
new york institution the bunker has been riding high for over ten years now throwing some of the citys best electronic music events and more recently launching one of ras favorite labels of the year with releases ranging from the kosmische-kissed work of forma to the headiness of donato dozzy and neels voices from the lake project its been a busy year but it seems the label has been keeping an ace in the hole: a new album from (aka move d and jonah sharp) might be the bunkers best record yet is a 75-minute set recorded at the bunkers tenth anniversary party in 2013 its separated into six tracks that take their names from elemental symbols reaganz live sets are hardware-intensive and it shows the music which progresses more as a single improvised piece rather than a series of songs is rich resonant and occasionally dense but even in its most sonically packed moments theres room for small details to stream in and out of the mix sharpe and moufang have been working together on and off for two decades and theyve developed an innate sense of where the other is going when they perform the overall sound gently sways between detroit-tinged techno more acidic passages and billowing ambience all anchored by a roland tr-909 and a 606 but the flow is subtle the effect is like drifting in and out of a dream while afloat on a gently bobbing sea there are moments that stand out from the reverie at one point the moody ebbs to a throbbing passage of acid bleeps handclaps and cavernous effects then at the ten-minute mark a heavenly hymnal two-chord melody arises for a blissful time-out seamlessly evolves from a tenacious jack-track to dubbed-out techno to abstract drama in its 12-minute run time a stretch of could almost be a lost track from abacus in his ultra-deep phases era albeit in somewhat steelier form the final two cuts and include some of the albums most intimate moments with a wistful melodicism only hinted at earlier on at times sinewy and squelchy at others warm and welcoming but always full of buoyancy and purpose is a fitting finale to the bunkers brilliant year
as with last years come follow me album and videotape single makes it plain that noah anthony aka is one hell of a craftsman it consists of three diligently constructed tracks that in addition to boasting sweeping arrangements and complexly layered grooves employ the essential components of synth-pop and e m in ways that are fresh yet familiar hes clearly a child of the recombinant age who has clinical knowledge of how his influences are put together and by extension can be taken apart and reassembled ut this doesnt mean his music is cold and studied quite the opposite: its exceptionally personal on and anthonys narcotized drawl veers between desperation and resignation as clipped kicks knotted static and phantom chords represent all the struggles and issues that so clearly vex him halfway through the latter he moans i dont hear you at all before his voice dissolves into a whirring loop of alls its one of those definitive industrial moments when alienation actually sounds erotic heavy mood relents oh so slightly on nine-minute track which takes up the whole of side yet thats only because anthony slipping into velvety echo has submitted fully to the grinding propulsion that surrounds him
pparently mixing the clubs anniversary compilation wasnt enough and detroits has gone and carved a love letter to the berlin club into wax is a comprehensive tribute to the former power plant complex with a track for each of the venues clubbing areas main rooms turn is suitably banging but silkily streamlined its series of throbbing chords rush by in harshly-panned sweeps as fluid synth elements are throttled by the tracks rigid and measured march providing the rinsed-out druggy vibes is which sucks the life out of the -side like a particularly bad case of dry mouth from well you know this one has the same hypnotically circling synth elements but they feel sinister underpinned by a heart-palpitating flutter as the foundation convulses tauntingly n we have which is exactly the respite from the lurid flavours of the that it should be built on a swung garage-esque beat it swallows up drab chord stabs into its heaving concave vortex

neil mcdonalds house is characterised by a cinematic quality since breaking through in 2011 the producer known as has released music on labels like shevchenko phonica and his own little strong recordings he kicks off the new year with his most high-profile gig to date: a five-track ep on begins unassumingly with lucid synths plodding amidst sterner torch-like flashes but less than 30 seconds later youre in the grips of a rampant club track multi-toned stabs play off against one another forming a rich melody that remains taut and driving throughout its the kind of opening that makes you sit up and take notice the first half of co2o (6mins) with its hard-nosed acid squelch retains that vigorous dance floor groove before an influx of rising strings injects some ethereal energy mcdonald uses this as a springboard to dive into the gentler side of his repertoire laying sea-breeze synths across light kicks on and crafting an emotive palette of bubbling modulations on standout cut by the beat has dropped away entirely leaving a cosy tapestry of birdcalls dainty melodies and childs laughter in the right context a john talabot set for example these tracks could have a lasting effect

is said to be a new techno-hybrid collaboration from portsmouth producers reset robot jon gurd and tom powell but the title track from their debut record is a sighing piece of slo-mo electro pop which is given a homespun air by the very english karl hyde-ish vocal ( come in from the rain its pissing down outside / ill make the tea just get yourself dry ) a pair of shorter harsher-sounding cuts follow life is the eps only instrumental track and hits on a claustrophobic seasick feel through searing drones and a swaying pattern of high keys is abstract and equally woozy and comes off more as an experimental interlude alan fitzpatricks rework of is the ep standout unashamedly big it improves on the originals pleasantly contemplative ambience with hands-in-the-air arps snappy percussion and echoing vocal interjections
the rough edges present on s wide-ranging fabric cd were supplemented by the rickety wooden house tool miniluv released on ostgut ton earlier this year and are essentially miniluv split and splayed open roomier and about double the length like cosmin trgs recent work theres barely any trace of dubstep left aside from maybe the hard swing in the way it subverts the tracky thump of house into a perpetually spiraling lilt is akin to night slugs with all the polish sanded off keeping that newly discovered grit intact doesnt build merely adding and subtracting in varying patterns is essentially the same thing but decidedly more conventional a rollicking railroad of a rhythm that occasionally rides bumpy basslines acid riffs and somersaulting piano motifs when it really gets going its a well-oiled machine but like its counterpart theres no discernible progression just elements mixed in and out on one hand is a natural at this kind of retro house since his move from drum bass to dubstep the dutch producer has been known for elegant hollowed-out shells that make room for considerable aesthetic influence from other genres the way he sneaks in unconventional sounds and ideas into an otherwise defined template is a refined science these are wonderfully powerful banging tools lacking the detail and the progression of his excellent great lengths album material however your mileage may vary
a real biggie this and bringing summer cheer into the christmas season with seven mixes to choose from the reel people offer pretty much something for everyone but best for the house crowd is joey negros effortlessly funky pair of mixes - a vocal edit and a dub the original brings a squelchy p-funk bass to the fore catchy as hell while rafa (rasmus faber) caters for the latin crowd with some serious bongo action and offbeat bass an excellent package

the sessions mixes on this comp continue the high standard set by label honcho erick morillo last year with some deep dirty and seriously steamy house music from the nunez mix is the best of his i can remember with a full and pumping drum sound throughout offering underground alternatives to well established cuts from thick dick and cassius (with choir ) nunez complements these with uplifting stuff from e-funk and piliavin zimbardo - voodoo juice anyone who da funk go more tribal with oscar gs stompathon dark beat kobbe fabb xs abyss (in a deep morillo dub) and the excellent rambos turn it up finishing with a curious cover of de peche modes personal jesus - innovative but not entirely effective overall though this is top-drawer house music from the stable ideal for a rousing start to the night or if the party carries on after hours its an illustration of why morillos label is now one of the usas premier dance imprints

this too shall pass s 2006 debut album was shamefully overlooked outside of drum bass circles at least his sophomore effort promises to change all that both due to the quality of the tunes and the all-star ensemble of collaborators which includes the likes of donaeo and the it also doesnt hurt that sees the veteran producer seamlessly gliding back and forth between his new embrace of 140 bpm territory and his typically frantic breakbeat-edit powered drum bass the aptly titled album opener gives a good taste of what is to come namely percussively-driven bass music peppered with a dub ethos of delay echoes and feedback; minimal simple but effective the grime things up on with beats and lyrics very much living up to the tracks title the tense and brooding beat provides a good background to the masculine bravado of the but also makes the occasional flashes of humor all the more amusing ( im a deep pan and youre a thin crust ) things get more junglistic on and the title track having admitted in an interview that loading up an amen break and a dub sample got too easy for him s tracks in this vein are nonetheless interesting and considered they take cues from the jungle of yesteryear but bring something new and intangible as well; slices the source breaks into atoms but keeps the beat rolling and in complete balance with the bass closer if is a more restrained exercise in the same area where jungle drum fills dance around a halfstep beat its not all golden though: comes off as contrived with the me-against-the-world message of and the electric guitar bombast of is a bit too much collab sits somewhere in between; its more than highlighting an issue with the album as a whole the slew of collaborators detracts from the albums cohesiveness has his hands all over but the vocalists manage to steal the limelight at times making the whole thing sound more like a compilation than an artist album despite these few shortfalls is a good lp clearly knows how beats and bass should come together regardless of tempo hopefully this time around those outside of the drum bass scene will realize it as well
nyc duo delia gonzales gavin russom a recent addition to the family give us another highly anticipated release in the form of the revelee remixes the original featured on last years much lauded days of mars and it now gets an overhaul courtesy of some remixers par excellence with the summer in full swing its a time for the illustrious to air out their big tracks and this particular package is already receiving plenty of brouhaha the ep gets off to a modest start with the alternative version a fairly banal proggy update on the original which at times echoes holden without ever coming close to melodic grandeur a bare pulse guides the way but its only some nice synth touches at the end which just save it from merely repeating a monotone one for the couch loafers production outfit dfa aka james murphy and tim goldsworthy offer a cool slice of laid back electrohouse which has disco nonchalance aplenty tight drums a hooky bassline and soft vocal snippets form the spine of this very friendly and versatile little number which should see plenty of support from bar and warm-up djs nothing too complicated melody-wise here but this smacks of late night party jams and will delight funkier club clientele as youd expect motor citys carl craig goes deep and very electronic electro synth lines patiently building for an eon before a limb-shaking kick drum joins and it becomes apparent that craigs made another monster akin to his falling up remix beautiful tinkly pianos offset the mounting tension heavy claps creating a sense of vastness but craig still manages to upset the applecart in his trademark jazzy style - this is nothing short of groundbreaking like his remixes of garniers barbiturk blues and masekelas the boys doin it here craig is proving his recent form and long may it last baby ford arrives late in one of his lo-fi trippy minimal moods fully intent on sinking the battleship before we get to port a world apart from the other mixes peter ford adds a touch of dark surrealism to the hereto largely upbeat package with low-slung barely audible and often introverted meanderings taking you on a jaunt down amnesia lane almost a carbon copy of his dead-eye jones underground outing from the early nineties (though not nearly as good) thisll confuse and disorient the most rational the dfa rerub will have the widest appeal clubwise hitting the middle ground between the bleakness of baby ford and the mundanity of the alternative version but yet again carl craig continues to dazzle us with a talent for production others may only dream about pipping the competition to the post in a package that has something for everyone

for all the complaints that dub techno has become mere formula there are plenty of artists working towards pushing (and pulling) it forward backward left and right levon vincents powerful tracks this past year have been unmistakably dub-influenced laced with a techno muscularity moritz von oswalds trio meanwhile pushed into the live realm taking techniques from the genre and tweaking them to masterful effect nd quietly but assuredly there is also manuel tur and langenberg whose small discography is set to swell over the course of the next few months their first effort to see the light of day since their 12-inch for styrax leaves is this one for ovum nd its one that continues to showcase their sterling dub-laden groovers the trio of eight-plus minute tracks are as moody as anything stephen hitchell has put to wax but they have a sense of urgency that makes their dance floor aims plain and have plenty of room for melancholy but also burn when they need to meanwhile seems to be the dj track of choice its not hard to hear why the starry-eyed lengthy builds are absent replaced by a distorted melody that does nothing except allow the duo to build percussion over top it inches never making much of a move but if you listen to its beginning and ending in quick succession youll be able to hear just how far it moves tur and langenberg here have created that rarest of gems the unassuming anthem
when i saw at decibel festival last year she stole the show looping her powerhouse vocals over all manner of jittery beats she tapped into a primal and ferocious sexuality unknown to many of her laptop-wielding peers following a cd-r release on hometown label last year kmeto begins with an ep that attempts to capture the pile-driving physicality of her live performances its four tracks all center on a romantic or sexual conceit does it the most literally as waves of sub-bass underline her threat feels like im ready to explode another slow-burner follows one that throws barbs of bass beneath a swirl of pitched-up vocals heads into addison groove territory with the twitchy but its downright juvenile with its childish refrain i know i love you because i hate you the ominous which freewheels madly into jungle territory ends the ep on an exhilarating enough note to forgive the misstep like most transitions from live to studio the ep doesnt entirely capture what its like to see her work up a sweat on stage with an album apparently on the way later this year time will tell if the long-player format better suits this wildly talented performer
biza collections coming thick and fast heres a real gem - two classy mixes of solid four to the floor house providing the sexiest of pre-club packages st years circo collection was a big success if drum heavy but the employment of and fabrizio has taken the standard up a notch vulkanos mix begins at a relatively slow pace with the dub of sub levels moving seamlessly on to fine house tracks from the likes of and dice whose amusing pe tells an biza story many a club head could relate to vulkanos own is shaping up to be one of the house records of the year with its wah-wah guitar and what a way to end with ep sounding better than ever seven years on fabrizio ups the tempo slightly and theres an outstanding middle section to his mix with dr kuchos dirty funk drive ep and the sexy bass driven from he then closes with christine johnsons powerful vocal spicing up for this is an excellent collection of house music that gets better the more you listen making it the biza comp to go for
the 47 ep is best understood as a companion to gully which came out on true panther sounds in august sprawling and diverse both releases seem intent on demonstrating that this new york-based producer is less concerned with specific tempos and rhythms than he is with world-building by now the aspects of jabbas universe will be familiar: the queasy melodies the swamp-like atmospheres the pervasive dark humour but he does a good job of further enriching them here in places its possible to discern jabbas jumping-off point highlight flips a soulful sample over a skittery footwork beat in a manner akin to his teklife affiliates the major difference is jabbas bizarre choice of sample all twanging resonator guitar and burbling vocal there are shades of footwork in too at first but from those perky beginnings things just get weirder and weirder somehow without skipping a beat we end up with a techno tune a few dozen bpm slower you tell me elsewhere and offer perspectives on instrumental hip-hop in the former its recast as an off-colour lullaby quaint but menacing the latters cool muscularity isnt a million miles away from the hip-hop hybrids of future brown only jabba favours fiddly tweaks over bold ideas this is a defining characteristic of his work and it can be frustrating: and both lack a strong grounding element still its easy to be entranced by their synth work clammy and off-colour like sickly skin in bad light
paul boex and dave miller have teamed up again as for another record trilogy on boexs label dark and serious moods abound on time and perception as the duo weaves sinister riffs through crisp no-frills percussion on both and the former with its offbeat metallic tremors is more aggressive while the mesmerizing effects of the latter will likely appeal to more introspective heads shifted is the records sole remixer his textured take on is geared towards blissed-out peak time finishes things off with the beatless which reveals an otherworldly landscape filled with sticky twisted-up stalks of sound it makes for an effective comedown and (unlike countless other techno records ambient sketches) deserves more than a casual listen all in all its a fine start for boex and millers latest endeavor
word play might be an easy one but disaro s first self-release cd-r from march was a work of perplexing and intriguing disarray much is known about him/her/them (online pictures suggest it is a female-fronted four-member band but who knows) music spoke for itself though: icy calculated bleak and rigid alongside salems king night it gave witch house long-format legitimacy pparently limited to a mere 100 physical copies a new collection of goth-tinged electronica is destined to remain an obscure release especially as it is only available on cassette from off the mood and the instrumentation are plain and stark: boys is a model of minimalistic desolation as an anemic melody and an even more dangerously thin vocalist sit alongside severe hi-hats and barely anything else it lasts six minutes but like death it feels like it lasts forever this sentiment of time being frozen is also echoed on err in during which a nicola kuperus-like comatose impersonator is surrounded by amniotic sound parcels predictably expressionistic at times other tracks offer crisper contrasts: for instance is a claustrophobic and oppressive affair that resembles salem themselves at their most mesmerizing and the feeling is even more present on with its distended rapped vocals or the gratuitously titled yet creepy snippet that pays homage to creepier smile ( ) the a track that appeared on the aforementioned disaro release is as direct as the band gets on here its one worth duplicating as it unifies the various influences at the core of the sound chris cosey a sedated dult nne clark and dore-era smashing pumpkins only moment the band let themselves deviate from the template set by this pantheon is on tm the albums one-minute coda that is built around a spunky sample of surprisingly lighter composure few more bpms and it could almost be an interlude from valanches s myspace page states their genre is visual and as precious and a bit silly as it sounds on paper its an apt description might not be as approachable as creep (whose first single days is as poppy witch house will ever get) but they arent as stubbornly cryptic as ooooo or imon either even if it already seems the trend is rapidly turning into a clich -ridden farce is as a concert flyer for the band once stated dark primordial lo-fi electronic psychedelia like mom used to make
k lschs debut came via its speicher sub-label this latest ep marks the third time hes returned to the series since and it continues his dalliances in technos trancier outskirts though not a straight-up anthem like lorely nor quite as likely to induce dance floor tears as all that matters is firmly aimed at the arms-in-the-air crew fittingly for the man who penned the earworm calabria the track shows some serious songwriting chops hitting every note on the goosebump scale at the point where when saints go machine singer s breathy breakdown lands the hairs on your neck seem set to stand up permanently transfer the flips chords from pianos to stadium-filling synths and youd have an edm smash k lsch opts for some strings bowed by s resident classical composer it doesnt exactly dial down the epicness but unlike the a which manipulates emotion through energetic ebb and flow relies too much on a strong hook that loops until its lost its heart-tugging impact
has produced its share of dance floor bombs kassem mosses 19 album was rife with them along with slower and more ruminative work the labels latest from label boss is of a piece with the latter though all three cuts slay in their own way you dont have to suspend disbelief all that much to imagine the a-side doing damage in the club at least for the first half led by an unreasonably heavy clang on the backbeat the cut overcomes its own wooziness even celebrating the feat with a cryptically motivating vocal sample: moving we can then about halfway through it switches gears completely cutting the tempo to a hip-hop trot and filling the mix with ghostly voices and paranoid pads it certainly still pumps though all but the most adventurous house jocks will have to save this one for home listening ditto the b-side the first track ups the tension with double-time drums but the melody is resolutely laid-back and funky its hard to tell which mood wins out; in the end like a musical rubin vase id say its in the eye of the beholder theres less ambiguity on the b2 with its ultimately slow roll out-of-tune melodies and queasy delays calling this music thrilling wouldnt be quite right but if you find yourself checking your pulse while giving a spin its certainly not out of boredom
is a new series of eps from established producers operating under the guises of greek gods each artist remaining anonymous until the labels full run is complete the first release comes from the god of fire and craftsmanship its an auspicious debut with labyrinthine 12-minute tracks taking up each side the sound is split somewhere between minimal and the high-tech machinery of artists like kkord this techno is detailed without ever sounding dense once it gets going -side ( take ) is a barnstormer slipping into a funky electro-inspired groove in its midsection before slowing back down into spacey downtempo and unspooling into ambient there are implacable electronic noises throughout: jittery basslines and all kinds of ear candy make the music sound alive on the -side ( give ) has a simpler 4/4 beat and bleepy synth motifs that merge into a storm of sustained chords and whirring organs its prog house in mood and prog rock in scope as epic as the myths that inspired the series
urban dictionary defines as the sound you make when somebody discovers you in the janitors closet which makes about as much sense as bogdan bareas house productions sometimes sure theyre straightforward on first glance just like that definition but once you look a little deeper things get a bit weird on bareas newest for the imprint the strangeness continues with a collaboration with fellow romanian the track crackles along with a chunky house beat but its assaulted on all sides along its 11 minute length by distorted congas slivers of melody a tinny theme that first its way through the murk it takes nearly eight minutes for things to sound anything other than slightly r om in their execution goes solo on the b with the gypsy stomp of unlike floor fillers like trompeta or heater though this doesnt have the sort of hook to excite the big room instead its dj tool fodder locking tuba trumpet blasts into step ready for someone to drop the main event over top on the other h is similar in tone to bareas recent astroceva ep: unrelenting house music thats almost techno in its forceful forward momentum all held together by the sped up ghost of a funky chic guitar
where modeselektors 50 weapons has fledged this year with no apparent loyalty to genre dubstep techno house and all the respective grey areas included parent has remained fairly planted in electro things seem to be changing however: californian-based elan brought his sunny glitch sounds to the label while latest signing stirs the pot further still electronic hip-hop is the most reductive description for low limit and lando kals outfit before throwing down for good or ill qualitative additions like future or even their own facetious blap term starting with uk bass components are packed into a sci-fi capsule complete with ticking ramadanman / pearson sound bites garage peals and moody synths they make it their own however through robo-filtering and a signature clustering of orchestrated computer sounds on the other hand is more funnelled riding an ominous synth line and clean mechanical percussion into an acidic breakdown it comes out the other end sounding slightly detuned in its discomforting and yet melodic conclusion thats exactly what i like about them their dark and sometimes jarring breed of dance music carries the apocalyptic sense of dread of early techno into a thoroughly modern context is a fine example of inbred bass and one deserving of the future tag with none of the stigma attached
is a retro-leaning synth-pop duo based in atlanta their 2012 lp personality matrix with its dark and mean underpinnings showed that theyre more ministry than erasure but you wouldnt know that from their most placid song now re-released on matt weiners new label the soft pads and sensual vocal layering brings to mind the cocteau twins and its hard not to hear a little karin dreijer in elise tippins voice theyre still in the early stage of the band where they sound like a bundle of influences scott frasers remix extends and burns that sweetness off until its a thick tar coating if the duos work hints occasionally at early ebm his lengthy rewire bludgeons those signifiers into it turning the percussion into a hissing haze of high-end another track from personality matrix also features and this ones a little twitchier more in line with what youd find on a darkwave compilation the ep is rounded off with a remix from l i e s artist (and minimal wave associate) beau another smart choice he tosses some amphetamines and lets it tweak out with a distorted throb so comically fast that its almost like slowed-down gabber on both remixes the band take remarkably well to their dance floor makeovers showing theres hidden potential in their already appealing sound
is next up on the juicy traxx imprint with and it features two remixes by the very talented robbie rivera the original mix for the most part is quite nice as it flows nicely with some upbeat drums and a pretty gritty basslines the track though loses me somewhat midway with a breakdown that goes into a sporadic spell of bleeps and effects that for me lack a musical direction apart from that though the track is pretty solid and has a good dancefloor flow the robbie rivera tribal mix as the name suggest unleashes some pretty solid drum patterns and unfortunately keeps most of the bleeps from the original the robbie rivera edit takes a more driving bassline approach early on and then unleashes some very nice synth patterns that turns this edit into an inspired uplifting moment definitely the highlight of the release
on the dead mans chest facebook page the influences listed are 91-94 band interests rum it might be tongue-in-cheek but its accurate dead mans chest is a conceptual alias focused on classic jungle sounds with a punch-drunk twist the project was born in the french alps where producer alex eveson took a sabbatical of sorts and fell in love with jungle and early drum bass (thanks especially to an old dj ss tape) is the third final and strongest chapter in a trilogy of records on ingredients the grooves here are warm the samples crackle and the tempos are leisurely (compared to modern drum bass anyways) its a welcoming record looking back to when jungle was still smooth and flighty the title track is ethereal with breaks and choral vocals layered over a zig-zagging shackleton-esque bassline gets even headier featuring dextrous drums that could have been chopped up in the paradox kitchen touches on a harder ragga vibe while is a rush of jungle bluster that still feels silky this music excels because of its rich tapestry of textures eveson weaves in samples and drums like hes working on a dense exotic embroidery its unabashedly retro sure but its done with such an original and thoroughly well-conceived style that it works hopefully the end of this trilogy doesnt mean the end of dead mans chest because this is evesons best music yet
i dont have a clue what number wave were at as far at detroit producers go but and his sistrum label are at the forefront of the current tide thats washing up on foreign shores yre still fairly young with only six releases under their belt but the consistency of the imprint has been staggering up to this point: from the strung out rumblings of raw fusion to the richly melodic motions scott has undoubtedly been one of the best producers of modern deep house in the last few years eponymous tracks on ep see scott depart from the lush tones of previous releases opting instead for a more taut tense style part takes up the first side steadily building the mood with a heavy kick and shuffling shakers before the grubby dubbed out chords start to peek their way out of the leaden groove long lead-in makes it useful for djs who like to mix things deeply as it takes a good four minutes for things to really kick off chords subside before being replaced by a memorable prodding synth that intertwines with a killer acid line to create one of those real dancefloor moments that will be sure to elevate the mood of many a late night dancer it doesnt last long however as were brought right down to earth with a strung out two-chord sequence until the track finishes second part fares less well eschewing the shakers for a rattling hat line and forceful chords on the same melodic theme on the right floors and in the right hands it could be used to create a powerful crescendo but ultimately feels like an afterthought in comparison to the flip package is completed by which finds scott in more familiar territory with its lazy bassline and celestial synths and while it isnt likely to set any dancefloors alight any time soon its ideal material for home djs upon their return from the club
you have to go back to 2012 to find the last time put anything to wax; 2011 if were talking about a full ep n the years since the melbourne native has been busy advancing the careers of those around him pushing the likes of elliot thomas volta cab and freekwency through his label ballards four-track excursion into heartfelt deep house on is an impressive comeback at barely a minute long opener sees ballard ease himself back into a rhythm setting up whats to come with a rising bed of synths and soft cosmic chords picks up the trail fusing elegant keys earnest vocals and puffy bass hits to produce a slice of blissed-out house though several bpm slower is better suited to clubs charging ahead with powerful kicks devastating claps and a synth line that sinks its teeth deep throw in some aching vocal snippets and youre left with a deliciously tense tapestry and the eps standout cut rather than stick to a winning formula ballard changes tack once again on from the melee of fat distorted drums roaming pads and machine-gun snares a silvery melody surges forward rounding out an exquisite return for the boss
s twelfth album could be taken as the flipside to holly herndons where that album likened the internet to a marriage of human and machine ken downie and richard and martin dust find it to be more of a mental cage one patrolled by sinister capitalist forces is the next part of a conceptual series about surveillance that began with 2008s radio scarecrow and 2009s further vexations though the themes of paranoia remain the same the albums structure is different res still both ambient and clubbier material here but instead of being blended together over the course of an album has a downtempo half preceding the more dance floor-orientated tracks and e appear almost serene before a foreboding energy creeps in and the sparse beats on the title track or could be sheffields abandoned steel foundries roaring back to life in the distance its inside those old industrial spaces that seek to take us onwards from its volts of kinetic energy a flashback to the warehouse raves that powered the sheffield bleep techno scene from which the group emerged yve drawn parallels between that city and detroit before and make them explicit as ever here on the deep pulsating techno of and album ends with in which crystalline sounds seem to spiral like a double helix a fitting metaphor for which also consists of two distinct strands working together as a whole
is a new stockholm-based label that has quickly made obvious its love of deep off-kilter techno up next is a vinyl ep from who a couple months ago put out an intriguing record on abdulla rashims northern electronics imprint this one is called and each side is split between one track of about ten minutes in length and a less bass-heavy roughly six-minute cut without a single 4/4 kick to be heard up first is the weakest track overall it unfurls in long swoops molten-metal riffs rising and falling in slow-motion but its strikingly similar to mike parkers distinctive analog trips and its length is a bit excessive better stuff follows beginning with set around 170 bpm and eschewing low-end propulsion its led by a torrent of acid synths and covered by dreary pads the other extended track here offers pleasantly perpetual polyrhythmic discord in its array of beeps boops chirps and ticks not to mention what sounds like a piano melody wandering around in the background haze is all swirling downcast synths and hushed rushes of cymbals and hi-hats finishing on a subdued note a record that favors the head over the feet
the techno community seems to be all about anonymity these days which depending on your position is either a blessing or a curse on one hand we get to blindly listen to things without predisposed opinions about particular artists or labels while on the other were gifted with a litany of tracks by mysterious artists that may never get proper credit regardless one thing is for sure: the lot of us are being treated to some profoundly amazing production work like all good surprises unknown producer and label emerged from seemingly nowhere oft overlooked by other more popular ghostly peers such as frozen order do not resist the eat and seldom felt ut similarities can be squelched there: is playing more the tortoise than the hare in this race the -side comes in subtly washed pads parlay the standard dubby-yet-funky bassline that has been coming out of hiding over the last year quick scan would yield nods to minimal stalwarts maurizio or chain reaction but the mystery producer is using the association merely as a launching pad for forward-thinking intricacies that are sure to have sleuths thinking this could be en klock or t++ in disguise on the flip however is where the detective work will become far more difficult while the first track might be a smooth trip down techno memory lane the -side is grinding abrasive and downright aggressive the track initially screams late-night erghain but as it powers on it glances over its shoulder to a haunting set of chords reminiscent of classic surgeon or christian morgenstern productions all the while driving the nail home in a big room way

like the name implies australian producer lewis day (who also splits time in berlin) has cut a wide swath across many fine underground labels singles on delusions of grandeur beats in space and esp institute established wallace as a producer who can spin between disco house and mid-tempo balearic and still tear up dance floors his way with drums makes almost every track he produces worth at least one spin the tumbling toms of suggest that music from memory sub-label might be a perfect fit for as those sumptuous tribal drums sound like heir apparent to montezumas raches wu du wu a label classic days rolling beat is mesmeric on its own but as his track climbs higher a gleaming arpeggio ever so slowly dilates the space and rises to the top sounds like where the drums on mariahs shinzo no tobira might have ended up ten minutes after the song ended when a high poignant melody wafts across midway through its a beguiling bit of beauty amid the beast is the eps highlight a slow-phasing cymbal hiss plunges into a drum circle and then the track swings between the sounds at the midpoint a rolling snare break is offset by a chopped high frequency its not strictly balearic but listen closely and youll hear the sound of seagulls circling both above and in your head

its common to claim that technolog is shrinking the global village that computers keep us in touch with home no matter where we are s new album evokes a vast sense of distance between his chilean birthplace and his berlin studio however proving the much older adage that distance makes the heart grows fonder the chilean producers second solo artist album and the first for his own label feels like a love letter to his homeland an album composed with the care of someone putting pen to paper rather than rushing out an e-mail indeed if there is a consistent theme to its a desire to sa something of substance with machines that supposedl make communication easier but where real meaning is often lost within the wires in that respect the alienation that often pervades is not just that of a man abroad on a foreign continent but also of someone searching for a human connection in a virtual world beginning with disjointed ke s and bleeps interrupting whispered and barel audible voices opening track y feels as if bucci is tr ing to call home but keeps losing the signal a sense of isolation that is carried over into the earning female vocal and equall plaintive electronics of like fellow producers with south american roots such as ricardo villalobos and occasional collaborator luciano bucci works tin vocals and rh thms into what is ostensibl minimal techno feels south american not because of specific samples melodies vocals or beats though its in the wa that bucci contrasts these textures with h per-modern production to capture the melanchol atmosphere of the bossa nova or tango is an impressionistic album and even when things apparentl come more into focus on the music still seems intangible and almost illusor even the more dance floor-driven tracks like feel like echoes of a part taking place over the horizon not that is intended as a club album but even more so than its 2005 predecessor familia asks to be contemplated as conceptual art and as such its often intellectuall impressive but occasionall less emotionall engaging bucci is clearl exploring the gaps and tensions between things: man and machine techno and traditional music europe and south america and memor and realit amongst others that sometimes doesnt quite connect the head and the heart encapsulates this concept perfectl
is the third mid season compilation to surface from cocoons summer residency in mnesia while previous editions have been mixed by breakthrough artists such as raresh chris tietjen and johnny d; ten years hands over the reins to undoubtedly two of the biggest names in electronic music tying into the marketing of cocoons latest stint on the white le is a representation of the clubs current sound rather than the sort of retrospective the title might suggest taking care of the first disc and what could largely be said to represent cocoons main room is a man whose white noise drenched and triplet filled productions have defined the big room techno sound of the late 00s while s productions can often be spotted a mile off his mix is relatively free of these elements instead focuses on a constant undulating groove with only two stand out rave like build ups to speak of starting with the dubbed out sounds of s the mix builds to reach a pleasantly driving and energetic feel highlights include merus a track with a stirringly bleepy top line strangely reminiscent of mes rej as played by an dhd child and nd s 90s style loops give a nod to s heritage in ep dish while s mix of jumps out at you as a record that will enjoy success across the techno and house board for some time surprisingly the low light of the set comes in the shape of s mix of the but this is only because the production trademarks uses have simply been ripped off and rinsed by lesser producers to the point of annoyance s mix is a less bombastic but no less enticing affair focusing on dark and meditative percussive sounds takes much longer than to get into the swing of things tracks such as s stepper create a spaciously dark atmosphere thats perfectly reflective of cocoons terrace early hours s usual s mixing style is worthy of note remarkably long ultra smooth mixes that cleverly switch eqs to transfer energy between tracks are the order of the day high points of the disc include mathias kadens off center rework of and naggingly memorable by focusing on creating a hypnotic vibe free of definable peak time moments delivers exactly the kind of mix you would expect him to play late on the white le which may or may not be to everyones taste criticism of is that its perhaps too close to a set at mnesia this in itself is not a bad thing but with recorded sets from around the world so freely available the question arises: a cd of a club mix still worth some of the most exciting mix albums of this year have benefited by offering elements that you wouldnt be able to hear in a normal club situation whether its joris voorns complex editing style on balance 14 s excursion into wonky 117 bpm weirdness on fabric 49 or even s own exciting experimentations with warmer house sounds on lab 01 ; the most memorable dance compilations often offer something you cant get from a saturday nights clubbing for that reason if youre looking for something a little more challenging or experimental then this may not be the best place to start however if youre looking for a mix of credible underground club sounds or to relive a recent balearic adventure ten years cocoon delivers admirably
is one of those artists you dont think about until you see his name in front of you hes a regular in berlin clubs but hes not a scenester like some of his more internationally popular peers still deutschmann has amassed a sizeable catalogue over the years including an underwhelming lp last year his functional take on house and techno has always worked better on the 12-inch format however check 2012s darkroom tales for an especially good example is as underrated a label as deutschmann is a producer and now his imprint comes to an end with its tenth release it arrives with final stamped in big letters on the sleeve but in typical fashion theres nothing grandiose about it its merely deutschmann throwing it down in three different ways is svelte and strutting wound up in synths and sitting on a powerful strikingly warm bassline latter does a lot to make an otherwise droning track feel dynamic meanwhile is dub techno polished to a slippery shine a competent genre exercise that benefits from deutschmanns subtle touch and then theres the ten-minute focal point that comes off tongue-in-cheek after all how can any producer get away with a techno track in where the main hook is a voice intoning detroit rippling klaxons a take-it-apart-and-build-it-back-up-again breakdown and one absurdly epic chord all combine for one of the biggest tracks in deutschmanns discography and though theres nothing terribly distinctive about it theres satisfaction in its familiarity
in an interview with slices berlin trio suggested that they make tracks in seclusion from the citys house and techno scene and yet their records sound like a product of the german capitals environment anyway in its imposing stature and accessible groove resembles sheds wk7 alias: bassy uk-referencing rhythms rumble over clanging chords and domineering 909 percussion the combination is exhilarating a bassline charges forward in the first minute of like a series of power surges it brings to mind the electronic spasms of objekts early 12-inches once it breaks into a 4/4 flow it jumps into fourth gear with outsized bass drums dramatic synth breaks and furiously whipping hi-hats jangly chords and a divas insistent cry drive along at a similarly hectic pace but its rhythm stays fluid easy and fun actually sounds like a record that could have been made about five years ago seemingly inspired by the techno/bass crossovers of that period but it offers a fresh angle on a blend of familiar ideas
the classical label founded in 1898 has a history with electronic music dating back to the 50s but club music artists have appeared on their sleeve notes only since the early 00s 2001s mo d volume 1 a mixed compilation of downtempo jams featuring cuts by mj cole and ltj bukem was an early example since then carl craig moritz von oswald and matthew herbert have all helmed the labels recomposed series in which producers known for making house and techno reinterpreted music by the likes of gustav mahler and maurice ravel s first album marks a new stage in the labels relationship with electronic music: its the first full-length of original material ever released on by a club music act as respected as the duo of carmine conte and matteo milleri are in house and techno circles an album on a label thats home to classically trained artists like francesco tristano max richter and j hann j hannsson feels like an audacious move it was r s boss renaat vandepapeliere who first planted the idea in their heads conte and milleri told xlr8r in 2015 after hearing a beatless track the duo released for free as part of nils frahms piano day in 2015 vandepapeliere expressed interest in signing an album of similar material r s never got to release the record but the belgians advice stayed with them which appears on has inspired an entire lp of sombre meandering music that tries desperately to tug at your heartstrings but never quite gets a good enough grip have never been ones for subtlety theyve built a glittering career from overtly emotional music that demands a certain kind of emotional response like the gloomy dramatic tech house of their dj sets and eps s musical tropes are designed to engender introspection or feelings of sadness heavy delay sweeping strings and minor-key melodies crop up repeatedly sometimes to stirring effect ( ) but mostly as a way of heightening atmosphere and filling the space which loops a bed of crackle and hiss beneath a lilting piano line wouldnt be vaguely dramatic were the whole thing not soaked in reverb similarly no amount of delay will hide the aimless plod of the piano on the albums weakest cut too often it feels like the fx have been deployed to mask a lack of ideas its not all so middling s strengths lie in their otherworldly sound design theyre experts at mood and texture not much happens in opening track dellimpossibile some piercing keys here a foggy synth there but you could cut the tension with a knife at the other end of the record on the atmosphere is almost upbeat as boomy puffs of percussion cradle deft twinkles and a hauntingly beautiful piano line the elements hang together in a gentle sway backed by the patter of rain on a window its easily the albums standout in the liner notes of ambient 1 (music for airports) brain eno said that the music on that album should be as ignorable as it is interesting this sort of music is for relaxing to for working to for having on in the background but that doesnt mean it has to be dull or as is the the case with schmalzy s debut isnt boring but theres nothing particularly original or challenging about it either rather than quietly bringing you under its spell its music that urges you to feel a certain way only diehard fans will take comfort in its bombast
we can t actually say that retrospective compilations are unique these days there are quite a few of them out there and i m sure there are more to come yet presented by is something to look deeper into right from the design of the box seems interesting has put together two cds of rare and classic house and techno tracks geographically speaking this is the sound from detroit chicago and new york the first cd is called chicago/detroit experience and includes tracks from the likes of dj pierre basic channel jeff mills rhythm is rhythm (derrick may) and many others tracks are both old and new ranging from 1987 to 2004 all mixed by timeless tracks like jeff mills expanded and basic channel phylyps track volume 1 guarantee a deep experience and the rest of the pack keep the emotion as well the chosen ones destiny house is a gem from the chicago house era mr fingers you re someone special brings in the soulful vocal groove produced by legendary larry heard in 1989 this was one of the most difficult tunes had to pick you simply cannot favour one larry heard tune to another the first cd is closed with underground resistance feat yolanda your time is up the first ur release ever cd 2 is unmixed and features eleven tracks including glenn undergrounds house music will never die kerri chandlers i feel it ron hardys house flashback and ron trents 12 of pleasure second track mike perras keep movin is truly a classic and we can all see dancing to this beat and melody and to mention more tracks definite highlights include cajmere with derrick carter dream state and byron burke string ensemble closing the compilation is ron trent 13 year-old song 12 of pleasure compared to to the first cd unmixed disc is a lot more housey this completes the retrospective journey through detroit chicago and new york underground house sound as you might expect this is a truly deep experience which himself points out this compilation is definitely not a best of chicago detroit and new york house sounds it s a very personal selection of tracks that are very special to me
when first emerged on luke slaters label he had a hard-edged and hard-swung sound that seemed to forgo atmosphere in favour going hard it was a sort distillation berghain sound that while perfectly acceptable wasnt all that unique but over time and plenty releases tracks have developed a viscous saturated soundscape suddenly his beats were drenched in atmospherics and effects matching his downcast post-punk visual aes tic and adding same kind early electronic and industrial influences you might find on perc trax se days the result a stunning debut album in which shows making final move from newcomer soundalike towards a respected name with a fierce sensibility for unique sound design indeed first six minutes begin in form slowly intensifying drone with but its a captivating sort drone particles decaying synth catching fire and yielding greater flames as y smolder with digital distortion from n on were flung deep into bowels fire and brimstone beats: is like being thrown through a gauntlet melting walls and twisting tunnels while has chords and strange percussive accounts that sound like machines that are making m are gurgling up corrosive acid the bangers like planetary assault system-esque are lent even more power when every sound seems to carry with it an entire universe minute ambient detail drums that throb with an immeasurable almost supernatural impact that detail seeps into every aspect whe r its in sound design or just structures mselves spends its first three minutes as a thickset slab thrumming drone but simple addition a hi-hat brings tune to life vividly one albums most viscerally thrilling moments wrapped up in a single high-frequency click its a surprisingly delicate and attentive dimension that allows to sidestep techno-album-dilemma and function both as a collection standalone club tracks and an engaging play-through because even at ir simplest ( disorienting strobe ) se tracks are complex enough to stand up to a great deal close-listening scrutiny back around time his debut drained seemed part a wave new(ish) uk producers sigha furesshu truss who were bringing techno back to slate grey skies british isles but doing it via a sound distinctly indebted to berlin by this point yre no longer new wave yre just part modern technos fabric and feels like a clincher for this particular generation no longer appears as an outsider trying his hand at techno but a veritable heavy-hitter and even if at over an hour it can be a little tiring not many techno albums have tried so admirably to strike a balance between bedroom and nightclub without sacrificing what makes ei r great for an artist who i once criticized for a lack distinction sees aggressively coming into his own

even at its deepest john tejadas music has big-room potential a master of touching melodies the us veteran has built a career on star-gazing synths and celestial pads heard throughout a catalogue that dates back to the mid-90s and while his affiliation with might suggest an artist favoured by djs most at home in big rooms his early releases get plenty of play in the nerdiest of circles (slow life and nicolas lutz are just some those who regularly rinse his tracks) as we heard on his recent signs under test album this underground-meets-overground approach makes him a great match for his new ep on the cologne label is further confirmation we get three melody-rich tunes with different levels of intensity is the biggest a tangle of high-pitched synths and bleeps less versatile than the eps deeper tracks its cascading melodies come close to breaking point but theyre kept in check by the chugging groove the other tracks are more reduced and will suit a wider range of djs tunnels along with zaps and squiggles bolstered a dreamy middle section thats easy to get swept up in thanks to a modest key riff and more cosmic effects is dreamier still rounding off an ep with a unique big-room appeal
for their latest ep needwant flip the traditional producer/vocalist relationship on its head giving a vocal from one of the most revered house music singers of all time to four producers to see what they can come up with nicholas sets an impressively high standard with a deep chugging house track made in the exact same spirit in which first entered the musical game all those years ago it sounds way too polished to be mistaken with something genuinely from that era but in terms of homage its extremely accomplished and unquestionably embodies the chicago sound it aims to emulate no go weirder with hollow metallic clangs and retro stabs epitomising their unique approach to house they focus on random vocal phrases that at times make it sound as if owens is standing just behind your shoulder whispering salaciously into your ear mario basanovs effort is similarly superb; severely stripped back it only has the barest of percussion and the occasional rise and fall of a pad to distract you from the vocal the only slight miss is kaines effort opting for big chords in a similar vein to love saves the day it starts promisingly enough but theres something just slightly uncomfortable about how the vocal sits on the track which in turn never quite finds its own groove
returns to the digital only stripped imprint with a track many of you may remember from the sound in motion album from james zabiela the original mix gets a little update here with the beats getting a smooth reworking flowing delightfully from the word go alongside a deep and sinister bassline the track is quite seductive thanks to the deep tones as well as the quirky effects that come into the track midway in the dave robertson frozen remix is a little more on the funky side with some more upbeat drums the fantastic bassline remains coming into the track a little way in after the bassline was at first a smooth bouncy pattern dave then turns the low end sounds into a war of gritty effects and furious hi hats a quality remix here a very solid release on stripped digital showcasing two very strong talents in dave robertson
might be s current mvp the shadowy australian has had his hands in a number of recent records that have been essential in outlining the labels freaked-out sound first there was his eerie 12-inch as tarcar and then the dreary folk album from f ingers both pulled away from its techno roots and into acoustic worlds of home recording weird spatial tricks moaning vocals and haunting instrumentation maneks first solo effort for the label captures his unique gifts and goes deep into unfamiliar realms a captivating mix of jazz no wave freak folk and drone the album is strange and hermetic with the 12-minute s begins on a harsh contrast: the bleat of a clarinet against a meat-grinder synth the woodwind runs circles around its mechanical counterpart and once the scribbling violin comes in the song becomes a push and pull of extremes maneks messy canvas goes from chaotic to eerily empty at its most intense s is a chaotic wall of noise at most pleasant the song is an evocative tone poem written in a language known only to manek the flipside explores the dub influences in his repertoire scorn is an exercise in heady plunderphonics as wobbling melodies are buried under layers of synth and mysterious sounds closes with volatile vibrations and the distorted vocals of mathew bratman its easily the records sparest and most out-there track but theres musicality to it the same ineffable quality that renders maneks work seductive in spite of its unfriendliness s warbly sound quality only makes it odder most of what manek puts out sounds like its been rotting in an attic for years and this album is no different coupled with an abrasive and rudimentary tunefulness the style traces a line back to no wave but where that music was explosive and cacophonous maneks is exploratory maybe even optimistic it feels like were discovering these sounds along with the artist who takes delight in the skronk of a wrong note or the satisfying squelch of a cranked up filter knob and when it all comes together for brief rare moments the effect is pleasing not confrontational no matter how many times you listen seems impossible to fully grasp it takes sharp left turns or takes you right to a dead end before moving on theres an element of surprise and unease to the lp which is core to the sound the label is one of electronic musics most surprising yet also most consistent and certainly the one of the strangest there may be no record that better embodies that complex style than
porto is perhaps one of the last places you might expect to find a bit of bass-driven 2-step-inspired dark house which is perhaps why has upped sticks from portugal and headed to the home of musical eclecticism london on this brief evidence runo deodato to his mum may find he picks up a lot of new friends in the uk and beyond one hes already connected with is george fitzgerald which is why after releases on spagat his latest outing makes it to theres obvious traces of s techno upbringing in which lashes a thumping skeletal detroit rhythm to skipping percussion and pulses of old school synth whether sub-consciously or not on starts out on the bass/garage/house axis before retracing its ancestry back to the late 90s broken beat movement ntricate drum programming feeds into a jacking chicago rhythm on a track that pulls off the neat trick of being dark and interesting not mournful and dull
started beats n space back in 999 new yorks dance music scene was a shambles a victim of relentless demographic change and giuliani era hostility from authorities as s show celebrates its 5th birthday the towns clubbing scene is as strong as its been in decades coincidence well yeah probably the reasons for new yorks resurgence are many but with the shows archives boasting dj s s from iconic artists like steinski beppe loda and mares on wax contemporary acts like prins thomas move d and dj koze and a list of new yorkers that ranges from minimal waves veronica vasicka and l e s s ron morelli to morgan geist and james murphy well its hard to argue that beats n space hasnt played some role in that comeback ts difficult to sum up a decade and a halfs worth of radio into one double disc mix but has given it his best shot has he succeeded unless youre a curmudgeon or a purist (in which case youre probably not listening to beats in space in the first place) the answer would have to be yes much like the show itself the two mixes are loose and shaggy affairs not in the mixing itself which is pr ty spot on but in regards to the selections which tend to waver b ween earnest house cuts and pure party music one which features 3 exclusive cuts starts off in the latter category with a tough eric version of s 980 slo mo grinder whirlpool from there the tempo rises with the pfelberg et edit of s waana s adds a touch of tenderness and then s whooping it up again with s low slung special mention at least for absurditys sake has to go to by the mysterious artist known here as its essentially the io express 968 bubblegum number chewy chewy with a beefed up kick and a bit of filtering second cd is billed as beats n space classics and it delivers first we g a rant from the shows most frequent caller victor from hington delivering one of his by now patented vaguely threatening messages: little my what you did was suicidal for your career thats followed up fittingly by morgan geist (in his guise) and his slightly ominous tech funker call s which segues into pachanga shimmering remix of s leading into one of s most sublime and emotive songs n ( ) nd the hits keep coming: dont by guayo murk man s nd n carl s epic take on s these are all top tier tracks and despite their varied moods fits them tog her like the pieces of puzzle ts a job well done and a great tribute to one of underground dance musics longest running institutions
when gqom spread out from durban south africa it seemed to be immediately embraced that could have been due to its similarity to uk funky with a tough but slinky swing that made it nimble even when it sounded huge that agility is highlighted on the first ep from the durban quartet which lands on the eclectic uk label se tracks take gqoms hefty swagger and enrich it with playful drum programming that approach is most obvious on and where the drums speed off into tangential fills darting up and down the measures like squirrels breakdown in is especially exciting as toms go wild over a chasm of reverb with its clipped vocal samples is more like the kind of gqom heard on this years oh compilation but its still uniquely elastic bounces along with syncopated drum loops though and are stronger than their counterparts all four tracks put novel twists on the gqom formula
over the past two years (who previously enjoyed success as peak:shift on the nuture label) has been one to watch with select releases turning up on moon harbour poker flat and dessous under his peak:shift guise he released deep emotive techno which has seen many pine for the resurrection of the nuture imprint these days however s releases are geared towards the dance floor perhaps none more so than his most recent release for moon harbour offshoot records like many of his recent releases this -inch started off life as part of flowers live set sees a scrap of female vocal jump around and reshuffled over the top of a rumbling bass line swelling strings and tribal percussion its rather limited to describe one of s tracks like this though because there is always so much going on the pads and strings make up the melody all of them contrasting and complementing each other beautifully though for all the wistful beauty of these sounds the track is grounded by the growling bass and driving percussion sees flower switch into atonal paranoia mode with a nod to robert hood he sets the synths squiggling with a simple fingered melody though things get significantly more complex as the track evolves though not as immediately accessible as has the intensity to cause considerable dance floor commotion and will be favoured by those who like their techno somewhat recondite and full of suspense
is the duo of regulars ben camp mat leutwyler and they team up to deliver a self titled production that features the guitar work of owen jarvis the original mix begins smoothly and builds very nicely with some subtle guitar riffs nice crisp drums and a smooth bassline the track breaks down nicely early on and unleashes some delightful guitar riffs that soon combine with some high tones melodies and drive into a summer array of sounds the roel h remix has a more subdued feel to it early with some big chunky sounds building the production the main guitar riffs come in and they lead into a sinister sounding electro bassline that quite simply appears from nowhere the track then becomes a little twisted and unique showing why roel is quite a wanted talent at the moment
as is usual for the series number 33 brings us two tracks aimed at the dancefloor by different artists these tracks aren t as hard as earlier entries in the series however hinting that the kompakt sublabel may be slightly redefining its identity first up is the orb s god less america/gorgeous (a political statement perhaps ) a satisfying dancefloor track that moves through a number of small build ups and peaks very nicely during its full eight and a half minutes the orb keep things interesting by moving a number of sounds through the track such as squiggly and squelchy lasers and a hypnotic xylophone loop that pops up every so often a slightly static digital bassline runs through the track holding it all together and giving it a nice hip-swinging grind although it never rocks out and turns into a dancefloor monster the groove maintains a steady pace and is guaranteed to keep a dancefloor moving nicely until the final minute or so of lovely beatless ambience the flip side features the debut of the rice twins s an act from sweden for penny and alexis starts off with drifting synth lines that immediately create a sense of warmth; you already know this is a track that is going to try to give you a big hug soft snares beat out a gentle shuffling rhythm and then suddenly a plucked synthetic melody bursts open almost like someone plucking a harp or violin as a series of digital bleeps fall down the musical register like rain behind it all the warm synth lines rise up again euphoric and enveloping the new trance perhaps it s short though clocking in at four and a half minutes; djs will need to mix in their next track some border community perhaps fairly quickly in the hands of the right dj however this will have a crowd hugging each other and putting their hands in the air reveling in the pure joy of it all
unlike their fellow portlandians chromatics and glass candy pursue a vibe that combines classic house with psychedelic leanings something like lindstrom/prins thomas cosmic disco but with jerky roland drum machines instead of echoey live kits this ep sees the club teaming up with cut who are releasing it on their own records along with their new re-vision of a tune that hit the streets last year in a manner characteristic of their own tunes cut reach for the stars with an arena-rock bravado that stretches their re-vision out while still remaining within the bounds of the original effectively presenting anew in a kind of spit-shined incarnation neurotic s remix significantly dials down the tunes inherently big-banger character preferring dubby to spacey earthy to cosmic getting down to flying high the b-side reveals the band in much more chicago-y hercules affair territory with two versions of a track called which oozes sleazy jacked-up house with psychedelics on mute the club takes a chance to get down and dirty with punchy vocal bursts and analog tweakery retro signifiers abound: expect lots of 808-y low end flamboyant singing and big old piano riffs its the kind of production that makes you a bit surprised they can squeeze it all in without feeling overstuffed and overbearing i find it a bit odd though that one is labeled club and one is labeled old school because both versions sound fairly similar and equally clubby and old-schooly either way if youre nostalgic for the sort of edgy sweaty abandon that characterizes a good deal of early 90s house production look no further
its been a year since s debut release for hotflush the simultaneously tough and tuneful revolver ep where that record built early-in-the-night atmospheres this one aims for peak-time further expanding slos creative remit in the process on the surface is simply a bruising dark techno cut but closer inspection reveals its stark base materials progressing with the pleasing smoothness thats become one of this producers calling cards injects some jungle and acid textures into this warehouse template its barrel-chested acid bassline dominating as clattering percussion and airy pads wax and wane in the background s heavy-industry rattle is leavened by the jaunty addition of a blasting whistle the title track finishes things on a less frenzied scuba-ish note its an airy collage of elasticated drums sparkling synth effects and hats whirling seductively around a call-to-arms vocal sample
when warsaws jacek plewicki described his bruta parties as seeking binary oppositions of emotions [and] sounds he might have been talking about the first two releases on his label the first jules venturinis no reference was a lo-fi house record with a wistful edge its follow up is anything but wistful made an obnoxiously strange techno ep for allergy season back in 2014; this is by some measure more strange and more obnoxious the title just about sums it up: this is techno for swamp creatures dense psychedelic and smothered in fx ooze that track is actually one of the lighter ones thanks to the churchy chords that struggle to be heard in the hellish churn elsewhere were deprived of even this glimpse of light the opening and closing tracks are bleak atmospheric pieces their synths keening like strange animals and are raging monsters berghain-applicable but for the fetid gunk dripping off their lean rhythmic frames the latter is particularly chaotic with synths that burble bleep and shriek erratically beset by storms of reverb and rhythmic noise it all disintegrates into a vocodered mulch at the end which clarifies into a voice saying well that was dirty
003 may have been missing the closing tip or highly recommended tag from the hardwax newsletter but its no less of a lovely 12-inch from the hand-stamped white label series most agree that is shed and 003 does little to dispel that idea pounding out raw techno laced with breakbeats that highlights the producers love of bass-oriented genres new and old the -side starts quickly plotting out a course for darker pastures before a ramshackle organ lick arrives to save the day it provides relief but it does so despite itself once you run into its careening path with sparks appropriately flying everywhere each time it attempts to turn it becomes easier to love and easier to discard from a djs perspective i lean toward the latter as its hook leavens the unrelenting percussion track underneath it that same organ finds its way onto the b-side this time bubbling around in uneasy tandem with the similar raw techno beat that favors like its predecessor on the -side theres a sense that things could fall apart at any moment throughout its length nd thats exactly the appeal wondering whether or not youre going to get to the end of those eight bars and what will happen after that is what makes techno of this variety so vital its also why shed is currently among its most celebrated producers

describing themselves as post-autonomic montreals have made it their mission to explore the unknown frontiers of drum bass aligning them with labels like samurai horo and exit that dismantle the genre or move it away from the dance floor over two albums and a handful of 12-inches have gone further and further afield; with their fourth ep on theyre practically off the radar is an illusory hard-to-parse four-tracker that contains some of the duos most bewitching yet frustrating music the ep imagines a planet fully colonised by technology where the distinction between living organisms and machines is ambiguous the music which is entirely freeform indeed blurs the boundaries between the living and the mechanical in the eight-minute opener waves gently crest on an ocean shore but its hard to tell if those sounds are natural or something else altogether all the while the track dips in and out of a drum bass beat structure like a machine with a mind of its own its a startling effect but sometimes i wish would stick to a single pool of atmospherics longer before dipping into the next one begins with ghostly drones before settling into a slow hesitant stagger while blankets the background with the sounds of airplanes taking off their field recordings are blended with ominous melodies that hint at something more human an emotional counterpart to the mechanistic sounds with it unintelligible radio transmissions and other voices is the most complete take on s vaguely creepy and captivating vision compare it to a bleary sound collage full of neat fx that doesnt quite cohere are ambitious but theyre still finding their way around the vast confusing world theyve built for themselves
is a new label from abdulla rashim the swedish producer whos been turning heads in recent years with a textured take on techno that has mostly come out on his own self-titled imprint this new label looks to be an outlet for contributions from friends as well as rashim first is s an eight-track release filled with chilly acid-laced abstractions a relative newcomer to electronic music with roots in black metal works in single takes with analog gear; the tb-303 is his go-to machine on a rare track without acid has a voice telling of immortal men living atop holy mountains that imagery is perfectly complemented by the thunderous norrl ndska which sees chase a few high-speed 303 riffs with furious uneven rushes of percussion features a more straightforward rhythm pitched around 90 bpm though its hardly any less frenetic while of a similar tempo but with much more open space is easily the albums most relaxed moment for me the second half of the ep is stronger with favoring even more melancholy box composed of nothing more than a single slowly (and smartly) shifted 303 line is a splendid piece albeit a short one and which staggers to the beat of odd meter drum patterns is another highlight acts as a brief prelude to last track n str nd s squirming slow-burning techno about as close as gets to a dance floor improvised one-take approach here does yield a rough patch or two a few of the endings are abrupt and the ambient pieces and could be given more time to stretch out but those are only minor issues: fans of off-kilter electronics should find to be a trip worth taking
with a career in production and label management that stretches well back into the 90s nick woolfson started records last summer with confidence in experience s well as a platform to showcase his new deeper housier kra alias the mock toof man looks to broaden the labels purview the fourth offering has s as its centrepiece relicensed after its initial 2011 release and accompanied by a trio of remixes the track is trademark watson raw underlay of stocky 707s darting claps and a cavorting bassline soon finds its bravado curbed by extended flashes of fervent pads deep crank up the emotional intensity with shuffling snares over stifled kicks before stripping it down to just watsons bassline perseus and johnny ux too acknowledge the basslines wicked potency: centres it between languid chimes and muted synths while ux adds further flavour with dashes of upfront percussion such close-cut homages offer little innovation but maybe thats watsons fault for making a bassline thats so irresistible

thus far s solo output has been limited to one track on smallville nd suddenly its morning compilation but hamburg producers impact on deep house has been profound through founding of smallville record shop label thats why its no surprise to hear quiet expertise that soaks through to surface on dissolute layers of his first release for swedish label geography smallville has been one of most dependable purveyors of languid deep house steinhoffs turn on geography works same vibe of druggy celestial stargazing of no r s synths strings bleed toge r in a beautifully marbled melange almost akin to smoo d-off shoegaze the synths swallow up percussion songs most attractive sections are ones completely devoid of percussion or nudged gently along by a single element the two tracks on flipside more conventionally favour ir rhythm sections with syrupy synths hanging in back ra r than flooding foreground but drums are always kept in that curious encased stasis buries a sonorous chord progression behind flickering vocal samples chunky bass while focuses almost entirely on its lazy susan of panning chords rotating around a dull kick drum
back in the mid-00s teo schulte and heiko laux a jazz man and a techno man found a middle ground on a handful of releases on lauxs kanzleramt label as offshore funk for theyve gone under their own names and offered up weighty organic sub 110 bpm house is a sturdy platter of dragging bass guitar kick and a handclap imaged in relief on which various languid tones are served there are synthetic washes electric piano that sounds like its being convulsed upon rather than played and a squelch that flops around at its leisure they happen to work with each other despite being completely autonomous it all gives a lynchian dazedness thats shared with but the open gaps between the parts on are filled with fuzz and reverb its smoother and more driving meanwhile has an incessant riff which dominates the mid and bass ranges theres no kick in sight as what sounds like miles davis playing electric guitar is stretched and distorted above after a number of careful listens im still not sure if it starts speeding up just as its almost faded out its not like it really matters; by this point any frame of reference is long gone anyway daniel who released an equally as drowsy ep on earlier this year gives something of a half-hearted wind for his remix its driven mostly by rhythmic midrange tonality but introduces a teasingly brief and syncopated bassline near the end till heads back into wider-bottomed territory giving a slinky undercurrent to dazzled pads an im-sure-i-know-what-hes-saying voice and the most complex rhythm on the ep

definitely bring out the best in tribal music whether it be progressive techy or funky so it comes as no suprise that this release has a lot of tribal percussion throughout side a randall jones mix working on some big labels such as hooj and bedrock randall jones brings out the whole tribe to provide beats - its that chunky and rich with beats throwing in a couple of snippets of nicoles voice here and there and of course the techy sounds and stabs added in for good measure side b phil charles dj skyy mix darker and menacing vibes this remix uses a lot of bass textures and beatless drops to map out a bleak soundscape mainly for after the climax when things are starting to ease out before bringing out the more banging stuff - definitely not one for the end of set as youd probably leave people on a low
are up next on and they deliver a vocal houser that looks set to be a bit of a anthem in the upcoming summer months in the uk in the shape of something to live for the original mix is first up and it builds very nicely with some nice chunky warm beats smooth melodic stabs and a very smooth baseline once the main vocal hits in the track really takes off with some big throbbing baselines and intense percussion from here on the track is an all out assault with not a dull moment in sight rhythm code go on with their remix in a slightly more subtle way yet the chunky ness is still very much there with some very strong baselines and smooth solid beats the vocals do not feature much but they are not missed too much as the track drives its way brilliantly with some very strong and intense low end rumbles a very solid first disc here from with and uplifting original mix equipped with a deep and driving techy mix on the flip
rolando is a man of many styles and as such makes a good choice for yet another volume in the nrk nitelife series but when theyre of this standard as far as im concerned they can release one every week theres twenty one tracks here and a sense of momentum through the whole mix as journeys through house and techno in as many forms as he can to ease us in theres deep cool stuff from nick holder but its not long until gene farriss show me a man is upping the dancefloor pressure this segues into agorias kofea one of the most distinctive tracks here with a rounded drum sound and wicked bass - brilliant then goes all soulful on us with a couple of deep house tunes then turns to more driving techno from the likes of joey beltram - extension has a kick drum hard as nails the synth riff breaking in fairly gently but mown down by the pounding beat after cuts from technasia model 500 and gerald mitchell the final euphoric chords from jeff mills see this way are a perfect rounding-off this is what mix albums should be all about - a logically planned set of tunes to get people on the dancefloor and with enough variety to ensure they stay there

drum bass dutchman jeroen snik has built up a solid discography based around clean melodic productions but it was his minimal dub / xylophobia dubstep twelve from 2010 that (rightfully) got him attention outside of 170 pm circles the second single taken from s debut album under the ice is another dubstep single and like much of that album theyre heavily polished vocal tracks taking the pummeling thrust of minimal dub and slapping a nice coat of vaseline over top comparisons to photek abound: snik has tapped for and the aging vocalist performs almost as well in his role here as in the hallowed days of solaris his tremulous moan fights to be heard above cresting waves of lfo and a busy multi-limbed percussive background gain featuring emphatic diva vocals from dresses up s now-trademark mix of pinpoint drums and snorting midrange bass with dramatic uplifting synths caught somewhere in between paranoia and ecstasy promising salvo for an album that looks to be one of the highlights of s polyglot bass music

since the demise of lcd soundsystem a gap has been left on the so-called disco-punk scene and for many it seemed oddball danish band and all-around partyers were the ones to fill it fair enough: they have the background the connections and the talent to step into the breach that said the fact neither tomas barfod tomas h ffding or jeppe kjellberg is a truly charismatic and distinctive frontman la james murphy was always going to be a problem despite the rather unique combination of voices they can offer y work best as a propulsive funk-fueled combinatory collective anyway as they proved last year on knee deep a mini-album filled with new-wave-pop-meets-teutonic-house nuggets they released surprisingly enough on yet as the every minute alone single reiterated with a mercurial remix from michael mayer (not to mention tale of us or life and deaths own ominous takes) s music can transfer quite well to the more discerning dance floor as it is now clearly their ambition new album furthers these leanings and parades the bands flair as much as their limits current single is a case in point as the original as immediate and catchy as it is needs the likes of detone and digitalism (in unforeseen subdued mode on the 12-inch) to make the proper album-to-dance floor transition y are however truly on to something when they indulge in sinuous melodies and goldfrapp-ian glam stomping ( ) or in metronomic this is happening outtake-like pulses ( ) the they even venture into frozen italo territories not unlike what vitalic did on his last album but as soon as they deviate from the albums overall template it feels like unnecessary digressions: even though reconciles the trio with their more indie roots through its campfire strumming and debonair vocal harmonies it uncomfortably sticks out next to its surroundings meanwhile is an utter sonic mess that combines woeful vocals and directionless synthetic buzzes six-minute album coda the is also its most end-of-set dance floor-friendly cut its the albums longest track and on it the danish trio finds delight in the same kind of bittersweet tweeness that made metronomys last long-player so endearing to some yet moments like these dont particularly justify s place on the roster and how they fit next to the labels recent signees such as field or walls however even though falls short in this context it does illustrates that the indie infuse their dance with has more funk and attitude than most
after the very successful release of people started to move in 2002 returns with a two tracker on the imprint first up is test and it s a pretty dark and gritty progressive cut the track features a talking vocal line that works quite well with the tribal like drums and gritty base snarls quite moody throughout especially late on when some gritty synth patterns lift the track another notch talk 2 me on the flip is another pretty sinister production full of electro baselines twisted effects and crisp beats all meeting to make a pretty solid production a nice release that sees a welcome return to form for
for the next installment on label manager satoshi tomiie is on duty to present production duo ice entitled stormer the guitar player and aja the keyboard player team up with vocalist uta dare to deliver a funky antodote to the label on the a-side is the saworiginalscandal mix from the outset it is clear to see that this is a different approach for satoshi acidic sounds meet a strong drum pattern early on as the sleazy vocals of uta dare soon take control the track maintains a solid flow throughout with a little cheeky melodic hook being the highlight the vocals get affected which helps build the track as does the bouncy baseline deep into the track interesting to say the least on the flip is the sawdubbedscandal mix the vocals are obviously less rife in this mix however there are many elements that remain intact the vocal effects and cheeky hook feature throughout as does the baseline that also makes a strong impact deep into the production essentially it has the a more structured layout but not too much different to write about overall not a bad release by saw uta dare s vocal adds a twisted approach on things and this track is sure to be suited to the dancefloor rather than the home dj setup it s a little bit different which may be a welcome ingredient for many or perhaps just a warm up for the very excellent cass release which is due up next on saw

- is a masterful composer her records blend modern classical with experimental electronics while her live performances take them to another level as they approach chaos with splatters of samples and dizzying left turns but rarely has her sense of composition been displayed so clearly as on grafts her first solo vinyl release on the surface its one of her simplest records but its not easily done she treats traditional composition methods with subtle electronic manipulation to make something singular grafts might be the most conventional thing coverdale has ever released its built with the pearlescent sound palette of steve reichs most famous ecm recordings and carefully layered nothing feels new or particularly experimental but the way coverdale puts it together is impressive starting with the bright tones of the opening elements arrive naturally but with precision the instruments sound ethereal as they move with the gentle sway of wind chimes sounds ghost over each other and fade out echoing 80s new age music occasionally piano and other instruments bleed through for an instant like radio static amid all this grafts has the construction of a classical composition with a defined beginning a rousing middle and an end that fades out into a pleasing drone the way coverdale links so many threads classic minimalism new age ambient and fourth world could feel dense if it werent so expertly done coverdales interests in classical and experimental electronic approaches have tended to exist in separate spheres on grafts she brings them together beautifully

eq grey are at boiling point of late with successive exciting releases this time around s - the fruit gets a workover in a block stomping fashion glen nicholls aka future funk squad sets about creating some breaky grooves with a beefed up mix of electroish sounds that work its way around a scintillating bassline neatly wrapped up between that are those cheeky synthlines that get tweaked as the pressure is kept at maximum with a break mid way where all hell is let loose as a wave of sound takes control taking it into an even bigger spiral of phat-ness the second mix sees a full australian assault as ivan gough and grant smillie take a cut up house approach as a chunked up series of beats set a constant flow as proceedings unfold a grinding percussive roll takes effect while the sleazy vocal lurks in the background its more of a sparce take but little chopped up cuts keep up the interest that bit further with a freaky spacious mix
set to follow their good form as a quality label with the 2nd release from danish-italina duo their production comes with an excellent original mix and a remix from sky rex the original mix is simply put quality quite minimal in its approach the deep and dubby baseline is simple yet strangely addictive while the little intricate sounds and echoes come in and out of the track in style giving it a deep yet funky feel not an epic or obvious production but on e that gets under the skin and works brilliantly the sky rex mix on the flip is not as straight forward as the original it s filled with quirkier sounds yet a nice deep baseline similar to the original remains and works a treat there is slightly more atmospheric elements used in this mix as well as some quirky elements used to great effect in the main breakdown the track takes a great route towards the end which is certainly not expected a quality release on both sides for following the quality release by pashka this highly exciting label continues to please with its unique releases which is key for any label that looks to get ahead of the game support insatiable s vision and check this release out
like tale of us before them martin buttrich and davide squillace arent names youd readily associate with minus the ibiza mainstays alongside their partner in crime matthias tanzmann are more associated with a fulsome tech house sound than the reduced style of richie hawtins label on this two-tracker the pair combine their sound with minuss darker glitchier approach named after buttrichs city of residence has a certain aggressiveness a rocking bassline which is gradually layered with a controlled cacophony of metallic splurges electrified synths and a hollow male vocal propels the track forward its devilish techno but with a house thrust (squillace lives in barcelona) isnt quite as vicious and as a result pales slightly in comparison the core is still entirely danceable plump kicks and percussive rolls make up a beefy groove but its lacking in its predecessors visceral energy tale of uss aforementioned another earth ep has been one of the biggest records of the summer while may not hit those heights it continues an interesting drive from hawtin to diversify and widen minuss reach
can sing and thats the most important thing you need to know about him he could sing his shopping list and id be swooning all the same although his dubstep-gone-pop trajectory aligns him with james blake or katy b the fellow londoner has a sound too hooky for the former and too withdrawn for the latter and hes more rooted in soul than either woons debut album is like blakes a bona fide solo album a hushed and isolated world where every sound comes from either his throat or the machines at his fingertips think garage-tinged synth pop with full-throated r b vocals woons production is suitably nocturnal and for its first half is a solitary walk through the deserted city night hinting at his past working with dubstep producers like burial (who co-produces ) subeena and ramadanman the understated instrumentals are an excellent showcase for his singing making tiny details (the perfectly-placed synth chords on ) that invade the perfectly rendered frigidity all the more powerful one particular trick youll hear a few times: woon weaving vocals into stunning choral arrangements it happens to uproarious effect on the blue-eyed soul of and is just as affectingly nervous and tense on when the multiple woons mesh with the whisper-quiet percussion and gentle chords its often irresistibly sleek futurist in sound and suavely retro in execution its when that stylized production suddenly vanishes that the album suffers and following the triumphant begins to spiral downward into open-mic night fare tracks like s and traverse territory dangerously reminiscent of john mayer particularly as his vocals become breathier and less layered woons songwriting is at the least serviceable but his songs just dont carry the same water without that little bit of the hardcore continuum flowing through them by the time the all-acoustic closer reluctantly half-opens its groggy eyes youre left wondering if this is the same record that began with the haunting garage gospel of and if woon is really just a decent singer getting undue attention because of a few lucky associations but even where he flounders its hard to begrudge him and with his debut album hes given us something thats brilliant half the time and so very listenable even when its not after all can sing and thats the most important thing you need to know about him for now anyway
passing judgment on s music seems somewhat churlish when you consider how much time he invests doing charity work in south america but theres enough on to stave f any uncomfortable conversations stomping opener is adorned with an intricate crunching rhythm thats been lashed to a couple counterpoint vocal samples squeakily high and gruffly low throughout theres an undertow distortion that almost sounds like a production fault could have been made by a different producer altogether built around a simple mid-tempo kick and thick layers doleful synths its electronica so spacey you can actually hear the wind whistling through the gaps to bag youll have to enter your finest online record emporium joined by swiss minimalist its a speedy yomp across tribal territories accompanied by whirring digital beeps and synth stabs perhaps buoyed by the presence house deity the ep closes in memorable fashion with revolving around a seemingly endless stream emotive analogue synth melodies slotted into each other its carried on top a rhythm track with barely-hidden acid tendencies
the trio of dress up in suits and ties for their live performances its not unlike kraftwerk and thats surely not an accident as one of the few truly live electronic groups around these days they take plenty of cues from the group musically however their aims couldnt be more different while kraftwerk were intent on celebrating computer worlds and the pleasure of radioactivity get off on controlling acoustic instrumentation pianos bass xylophone the lovely sound that pebbles make as they make their way down from one end of a rainstick to the other the trios powerful video for is reminiscent of daft punks around the world slowly revealing each individual instrument to the viewer (in this case its fascinatingly literal until the final act when a quartet of ballerinas come in to steal the show ) it helps that its among their most immediately catchy songs as well featuring a jazzy piano riff and percussion that has syncopation hidden within its easy 4/4 the a-side to their new 12-inch fares just as well even without the visual clues: its hard not to identify the fat bass or the cymbals when they come crashing in but it takes an outsider to isolate what makes so interesting in losouls remix of you can hear each element coming from a mile away somehow the trio though hardly interested in anything other than making you dance are capable of surprise even when you see every little thing displayed before you

sued is the kind of label you have to take as-is for the most part their records have no artwork or titles the artists go by truncated aliases like svn xi pg sounds and sw theres nothing to go by except for the music itself which is often dusty and low-key the co-founders sw and svn define the label more than any of its other artists sw in particular has chalked up a reputation as a source of eclectic house and techno with the reminder a three-part series of eps that started in 2013 sw wiped some of the grit off his productions resulting in rapturous-but-humble tracks that had the retro-futuristic sheen of 90s electronica its a reminder of the good things from detroit chicago and the other british stuff he told ra at the time labels from the middle and the end of the 90s are a big inspiration for me those ideas and influences come to the fore on sw s first album which feels like the hard-earned culmination of a strong five years for both artist and label the opening run of is gentle and cheery like the groggy hours of early dawn the drums are soft the basslines feel cushioned and the pads color orange rays of sunlight between the rhythms in the stunning opener sw sprinkles vintage breaks at all the right points and on track six essentially an elaborate disco edit he varies the length of the loops and percussion so that it seems to constantly morph on the incredible second track sw plays with jazzy drums every so often dropping a heavy bass note the kind youd hear in drum bass loose limber and breezy it evokes the likes of plaid peak-era photek and galaxy 2 galaxy without echoing any of them too closely listening through its striking how far the music has come from the early sw records only one of these tracks right in the middle of the album like a load-bearing pillar is straight-up house though much more polished than usual (in a nice flourish it falls into a locked groove at the end and chugs away ad infinitum) the album moves from dreamy broken beat to thudding house and minimalist ambient ending with a funky drum workout that ties these threads together like skee masks excellent shred from early is a lesson in how to put together a dance music album the tracks dont flag the momentum is smooth and the variety keeps you hooked and the musics unassuming nature makes it that much easier to love sw doesnt need track titles or artwork for the vibrancy of his music to come across its all there in the buoyant beats and beautiful melodies

focuses on the little things with time the italian artists techno has grown cerebral detail-oriented best moments of 2013s air is freedom for example ab oned the techno blueprint zeroing in on quirky morsels of electronica instead last year he exp ed on the concept with two free releases : sketches (2009-2012) drafts (2010-2014) were ostensibly unfinished leftovers but in execution they actually made a sprawling open-ended extension of air is freedom this has coincided with s general move away from straight-up techno in favour of broken hessle audio-style bangers as heard on tank / beaviane his 12-inch from last year on mistry now takes his updated style strips it down for a record of spindly oddities in a brief interview with ra dario tronchin said he likes working with because theres no pressure to make clich d music or bangers sure enough you wont find much of either on the tracks are brief ephemeral even when theyre slamming tronchin tends to set up a broken beat let it dissipate into a long atmospheric breakdown then bring it back twice as hard formula is especially pleasing on the groovy techno of or the trippy where the percussion is mapped out all over the stereo spectrum lends the otherwise spartan track a certain meatiness though his palettes are stark the sounds are rich; tronchins bottomless breakdowns are ornate deep theres a physicality to both the drums pads which st out against the blank backdrop with its clinical approach inscrutable beats can bring to mind pearson sounds self-titled lp from earlier this year like that album is difficult unpredictable also lacks the typical grappling points of a long-player but tronchin excels at these sorts of production sketches so the best moments of are actually its fussiest aptly-named is one of the most abstract tracks with a rhythm that swims upstream against splashing water droplets is just a swung pattern that strikes with militant precision doled out in the simplest cleanest tones possible sketches drafts laid out the wide scope of tronchins abilities with a rambling ramshackle narrative approach continues on which contains tronchins most focused work presented over a remarkably wide spectrum (theres even sleepy soothing stuff such as dreamy aphex-like closer ) with its jagged flow short attention span could easily pass you by without making much of an impression it isnt as impressively whole as air is freedom but as with the best of tronchins music if you focus on the details youll find theres more here than might first be apparent

k rob ellis is a true original fter helping to shape the dubstep scene he didnt take the techno and house route like many of his peers instead he twisted the bass-heavy dance music of his earliest releases into mangled shapes creating an anything-goes style later picked up by younger producers like mumdance logos and atu every once in a while ellis puts out a landmark track qawwali the oxer croydon house that offers a new permutation of the stellar sound design and creative arrangements that have made him so respected is another one of these tracks s the title hints the sounds of are aquatic everything sloshes around and the drums sound like shotguns going off underwater this lends a psychedelic tinge to the tracks otherwise powerful thrust there are plenty of other odd touches wheezing drills a squalling bassline that make it feel like a gauntlet of sound effects you couldnt really call it techno or dubstep or grime is the kind of track that makes you stop in the middle of a set and think what the hell is that (you can hear an early version on mumdances fabriclive mix from 2015 ) with ominous horns more watery sound effects and drums that creep rather than lunge is on the -side its the inverse of with all of its creativity and dexterity applied to a sparser template ut as weird as and are you wouldnt have any trouble dancing to them ellis can make something you know how to move to even if youve never heard anything like it before
colin de la plante doesnt come across as someone trying to present grandiose artistic statements to the world since the early 00s the canadian-born berlin-based producer has been cruising the highways and byways of modern house and techno with oddball disco-inflected jams loaded with wry samples and a certain indefinable flair a way hes quite similar to luke vibert continuously prolific and choosing to have fun rather than straining to make high-concept music his third album as arrives nine years after his first and it doesnt feel like much has changed tempos and structures of past jams are compatible with most of the tracks on his latest lp when artists stay in one spot it can lead to stagnation but de la plantes instinct for the unusual keeps things interesting granted some material feels a little disposable drums mix of is a functional tool that has no place on an album not least with the far more interesting original four tracks earlier s techy beat is proficient but middle-of-the-road terms of club tracks should instead stand for strange and distinctive moments like metallic clank of the percussion subtle flecks of acid bass and layers of sampled texture all make for an album standout and the result is as dj-friendly as it gets res also plenty of space for less floor-focused moments is a slower trip through unnerving reverbs dusty beats and looming synth swells dont gets even lower in the bpms as the fug of heavily processed samples gets thicker provides another highlight via sumptuous lounge keys and limber drum programming timbres like these perfectly suit de la plantes mo res little on this album that will surprise longtime followers but for those that dig his approach that shouldnt be a problem
with the rise of minimal technos centre of gravity shifted harder sounds which had long reigned supreme advent surgeon speedy j and chris liebling are just a few of the biggest names fell out of favour as most techno djs started slowing down the bpms and refilling their record crates this shift was most clearly symbolized with the closure of the mighty tresor club for so long home to the hardest techno about general consensus was that techno had gotten into a locked groove too loopy too banging too stuck in the same sounds and its charms were tiring yet recently we ve been seeing the emergence of a new take on techno and while tresor may be up and running again at a new location it is at another berlin club berghain where this renaissance is taking place this new sound clearly shares some characteristics with minimal most notably a hardwax/basic channel influence and much slower bpms but it is clearly distinct and undeniably techno if you want a snapshot of the sound (and you can t afford a ticket to berlin) then is for you: this is one of the best and most timely mix cds to have appeared in the last year or two in providing a clear manifesto for this new sound it s fitting that incorporates a number of specially commissioned tracks including the records from veteran producer tobias and newcomer which open the mix ir tone sets the scene for what to come: much like the architecture of berghain itself the sounds are stripped back spacious and hard edged s is dark dynamic and captivating and later in the mix the thunderous vangal by kempi proves to be a real highlight s a forward looking variety of techno but it s also rooted in what s come before in the clubs likes mixing in the classics and finds space for three older records closing with s (1996) works perfectly but the placement of the other two feels a bit forced (1986) is an amazing track no doubt but its inclusion here disrupts the flow while the abrupt crossfade that announces s (1988) is also rather awkward se are minor complaints though elsewhere the mix is something of a definitive statement of where techno is at now and where it is going s a purist vision to be sure but it is by no means limited: s excellent 1 is dubsteppish by is standout neo detroit while the piano riffs and gradual undulations of s underscores the link between berghain and rekids crossover hypnotism ( fans new to are advised to give this mix a try ) in short it s something of a guided tour of the most innovative and forward thinking techno around simply put this cd is a winner track selection is near flawless and the mixing is of a standard you d expect from a veteran like dettmman andr galluzzi s first volume in the berghain series was somewhat underappreciated but that fate won t befall s volume s are we ll look back at as a defining movement when techno got out of that locked groove and started moving forward again
after the very fantastic alex smoke album unleash another artist album that is sure to tickle the fancy of many a house music lover the duo craig morrison and graeme reedie team up as to deliver their second album the album follows their debut lp a soul thing which featured the stunning right on and this album looks to continue the great reputation these two have forged in the last few years the album begins delightfully with the smooth basslines and summer grooves of when the devil drives and folie a deux one of the highlights comes in the shape of their first single from the album les nocturnes a production that relies on a delightful smooth rolling bassline and some uplifting stabbing synths inferno is a little darker with its sharp basslines and smooth atmospheric elements while feeling blue lifts the tempo with an uplifting vocal house cut smoke and mirrors takes the album on a funky trip with some blessed out beats and delicate piano lines the album drops the pace yet again with a downtempo loungey style tune with you can t lose what you never had i m not sure what to make of under a werewolf moon as it has one of those horrible bouncing melodies that atrocious euro trash from the nineties used however it at least pulls it off a lot better then that did room 666 at the deadly hotel brings a psychedelic touch to the album with slow beats and some uplifting high pitched screeches smooth house is the name of the game again with the penultimate production in burning sands and it is a great way to introduce the last production a track that is gritty with its new order sounding hooks its deep and dubby baselines and its retro male vocals it is indeed a great way to conclude the album i must say that to indeed deliver a fine album if you are aware of their sound then this album will definitely not be familiar as for the most part they stick to what they know best with smooth chunky house cuts there are productions that veer away from their norm and thankfully they do these track quite tastefully creating a pretty well rounded album
luke slater completes his rehabilitation from pop star in waiting to reinstated techno hero with this remix package slater has impressed with his recent take on fabrice lig but on this occasion he faces stiff remix competition from james ruskin and function the unlikely duos version of is brilliant in its simplicity and design with the american producers keeping the momentum going through the use of pounding drums doubled up reverberated claps and a niggling insistent acid line when with two minutes remaining an ominous chord sequence kicks in the listener is reminded of secret cinemas 1994 classic timeless altitude but in the main this is truly contemporary techno likewise james ruskins remix: like the title track on his new single the uk producer delivers a repetitive metallic rhythm cloaked in mysterious reverberating sounds like the sound of a bmw 3 series whizzing through a mountain tunnel at 3 am ruskins version is majestic and fine-tuned every component working in perfect unison despite these high standards slater shines the brightest of his three remixes the take is the least extreme its acid-flecked construction sounding like surface noise but never quite hitting the jugular the two versions are entirely different however the first one starts with a discordant riff and is quickly joined by a growling noisy rhythm while the second resonates to the sound of a wall of metallic feedback and is underpinned by jagged cheese-wire percussion and thundering drums that neither relents until synapses snap or systems are levelled speaks volumes about slaters remarkable comeback
seattles is a pretty big fan of uk bass it seems his approach however is slightly different to that seen in recent years cherrypicking the most blissful elements of the genre narcotic pitch-sliding chords and honeyed vocals his two original tracks here are an express ticket to bacchanalia where rhythm is but a pleasant diversion s a long way from the intensity found across the pond the title track supplements the downy melange with chirpy ladders of arps while the more pensive spins string-like synths into a languid intoxicating whirlpool the remaining three cuts all remixes of throw a bit more focus onto beats volleys of 2-step snares and kicks underpin pikchas version for instance though he keeps things blissful lakosas dub is a bit softer inserting 4/4 drums and claps into the heady fog and charting a smooth course romas remix may be the nicest flushed with whimsy the frenchmans effort returns to 2-step but flocks the drums in bird and insect calls courting enchanted garden imagery for those who find s originals just a bit too much this hyper-detailed alternative seems ideal

should be living in detroit at moment it seems so uk producers output under his own name thus far falls neatly in line with work of patrice scott and keith worthy two of motor citys most celebrated new lights sagnia has previously released material on worthys aes tic audio and his newest 12-inch for his own imprint atmospheric existence marks out same ambient and deep house territory (so much so that b-side miaplacidus even sounds like an alternate mix of previously released relativity ) similar sound palette is an issue with much of causal structure ep but sagnias talent for composition sees him through things start splendidly; is best thing here a deep and moody electro burner that sounds nothing like his deep house brethren things get safer from re however with both and doing little to distinguish mselves from his previous 12-inch sagnias sound is unique from worthy and scott in that you can hear echoes of his classical music background in complexity of his melodies: this isnt your usual one chord deep house clearly sagnia has chops to add something important to genre aside from though its hard to call causal structure ep anything more than very accomplished

the technoise movement has unleashed its fair share of eardrum scrapers over the last several years yet few are as explicitly belligerent as the debut 12-inch from even container at his most intense ( slush from the adhesive ep for example) manages to maintain a sense of design and precision that nods to technos reverence for functionality alvarino in contrast is far more interested in hijacking the formal elements associated with techno so he can unleash a mechanized assault that ultimately remains loyal to the loud fast and aggressive ethos of the noise-punk continuum in which he operates to put it another way the brooklyn musician makes beats for headbangers not ravers this he makes abundantly clear from the outset: is 75 harsh seconds of wailing digital decay and looped crunch and nothing more and the other highlights might be longer and more layered but theyre no less ruthless the latter is pure muscularity as the rhythm lunges and flails as though it were the undiluted expression of the producers own tortured nervous system the only piece that isnt 100 balls to the wall is which lacks the force and excitement of the tracks around it its interesting but alvarino is best when churning out ragers
2014 was an especially prolific year for ann arbors dmarc cantu and the breakneck pace seems well suited to his sound raw to-the-point and effective his tracks bear the sort of creative spark that doesnt sound labored over one of the cuts on his first 12-inch of is apparently just that: cantu got korgs volca beats drum machine and knocked out the track in a day it sounds like a guy having a blast with a new toy cantu gives each element of his drum groove some time in the spotlight and at one point he rides the tempo knob from ridiculously fast to the lethargic shuffle that finishes the track is more polished and catchier built around the sort of squelchy hummable bassline cantu writes so well the track is lean with just a few scratchy drum sounds and a brief countermelody filling out the arrangement unfortunately this economy leaves a little limp as it winds down by the time the bassline and drums switch up slightly the groove seems to have run its course these arent cantus best tracks and the release feels a bit less than essential dig into his work with tadd mullinax as 2 am/fm or his solo records on cr me organization and m gt;o gt;s to hear him at his best but they show an artist whos admirably in thrall of his machines

taken totally out of context a mix by somebody called featuring e evoe and sounds like something your little brother would have cooked up with two tape decks on a rainy day afternoon during his star wars phase circa 1993 ut it s and instead of a dusty old mixtape it s the whopping 39th installment of the abriclive c series and somebody called just happens to be a hugely respected jock with a longtime residence at abric re s still significant potential for failure even with that pedigree but luckily pulls it off with this and his three volume how cut n paste mix series s has defined himself as a sort of kid in a musical sandbox bridging wide gaps between genres and tempos abriclive 39 the approach sometimes feels childish such as on the mix s intro for which s wishlist apparently read i want a boxing announcer an sirens an apocalyptic chanting an an an a shout out from k ye west ut if never grew up on the inside at least he s become a much better j a fact consistently on display here first ten or so tracks of abriclive 39 aren t focused much on clever between track mixing but rather s scratching skills and easter eggs hidden here and there uncredited hip hop bonus beats on eternal in the are an obvious one but careful listening reveals for instance s 06 rap track getting more comfy with its source material golden hen by late dancehall artist tenor saw from years prior re also seems to be a wink and a nod in putting together s and s jackin as the former track s lyricist el unky homosapien and mr are real life cousins maybe i m reaching too far though only misstep on this part of the mix is the inclusion of s instrumental take on marvin gaye s whether intentional or not it brings the mix s building energy to a total standstill horns are pretty damn sleazy but brass band music is basically poison gas for the dancefloor and thus should ve had no place here rom here on out wisely decides to crack his knuckles and get a bit more aggressive calling on altimore producers and amabounce to spice up old tracks by the artists mentioned in this review s first sentence s has some of the best and most recognizable old school rap production out there stripping it away entirely as does might even seem sacrilegious s refix however is a dirty more bass roller that gives the trio s sexed up come ons more immediacy s just too bad that such a novel take on an old school rap track is side by side with the original version of mc s s sure it s classic but after twenty plus years getting rinsed in loads of movies and commercials not to mention high school dances and wedding receptions it s long overdue for some bonus beats of its own closeout of abriclive 39 is heavy on drum n bass with the laidback reggae vibes on uddz round suddenly giving way to a tough dnb breakbeat s goofy as hell gets cleverly mashed up with dam s a jungle tune ten years old but none the worse for the wear time however hasn t been so kind to j s from 199 again it s a legendary and hugely influential tune but nowadays sounds too slow and at nearly four minutes (the mix s longest track) goes on too long gets last word with the warm calypso sounds of is the for from the early 0s more bonus beats are in full effect of course but at its heart this is a sweet low key love letter to the home of both and abric s an almost beautiful way to close out the mix certainly abriclive s most eclectic and perhaps most representative of the all styles all kinds approach the series has taken overall unlike a few recent installments it doesn t feel like had something to prove and instead chose tracks he loves regardless of how fresh they are that sense abriclive 39 is the series most timeless entry yet
stalwart of garnier s label releases a second single from his late 2006 album caracol was one of the highlights of the album and has been including it in most of his sets recently now he s caning the remixes sounds good right well maybe the -side is undeniably marc if you ve heard anything he s done over the last year you know what to expect it has rough mechanical bass stabs and another one of those creeping ominous melody lines that grows as the track progresses it s a familiar sound and one that has dancefloor appeal fans of will love this but for me it s very formulaic twelve months ago this sound was fresh now it sounds a little stale on the flip frenchman tim gives a shake-up he strips back the energetic melodies of the original and replaces them with tension racked synth stabs and bubbling basslines the percussion is dampened which only enhances the subtlety if harrison ford was chasing a replicant through a nightclub in this is what vangelis would ve penned for the soundtrack s mix is aimed for the main floor shoots for the back room but in my opinion stick with the original
is a trans-atlantic project the duo of henry collins and richard wilson made their debut album dzzzz over the internet shuffling ideas between their respective studios in france and la the content is just as international as the method of its production fusing dubbed out hip-hop rhythms with african percussion and grime atmospheres dzzzz is grubby as all hell its kicks are thickly distorted its occasional vocal samples are full of breathy aggression and its synths sound like theyre being run up against a knife sharpener its a monochrome record shot through with occasional bursts of percussive colour like a flickering neon light at the end of a motorway underpass this aesthetic is best demonstrated both in name and in sound on an album highlight full of dubby keys disembodied screeching and a chopped-up vocal hook ( i have that dank dank dank ) theres a pattern here and its a very effective one polyrhythmic drums nudge up against stark clipped kicks a grimy fug evokes the darkest point of an inner city night pierced occasionally by cut-up vocals as on opener the aptly titled adds strung out pads to the equation and dials up the african clatter coming off like a horror film soundtracked by a kuduro band dmmmm meanwhile tweaks the formula to produce something as full of glamour as of gloom with silken pitched-up vocal loops as strong as its highlights are dzzzz loses its way when go off-piste the noisier doodlings of and feel half-finished meandering where the rest of the record swaggers works a bit better with shuddering lasers slicing through a murk of what sounds like heavily reverbed choral singing but even this falls dramatically short of the records best moments are at their best when theyre at their dubbiest their grimiest and their most morbid
coinciding with the release of s likeable yet patchy debut album last month came news that clarian north was leaving the band to pursue solo endeavors adam hunter hasnt confirmed whether hell be continuing as meaning this now somewhat aptly titled single release may well be the bands swansong was among the stronger tracks on the album and this release is given a sense of occasion with two high profile remixes from maceo and matthew dear arguably more of a house edit than a remix s condenses the percussion before dropping the final-third into a soaring breakdown dears mix as audion strays further from the original stripped and warped beyond recognition its an 11-minute ramble that gradually builds towards a plaintive crescendo despite the admirable complexity of dears version the original is still the pick here

just a few releases old msterdams club and its eponymously-named label comes correct with this release by resident dj is a gloriously buoyant piece of sunshine techno its original mix is glass half-full music but crucially never strays into clich theres a dense stab of bass that permeates throughout but the general feeling induced is one of being enveloped in warmth s remix provides a nice foil keeping to a traditional dub arrangement with swathes of sound passing through raising and lowering the intensity as they do is no slouch either completely different in tone to its a brash percussive track whose effortless momentum is the perfect accompaniment to the stammering vocals

ts difficult not to want to decipher as roots manuva rodney smith has always been a cryptic lyricist but with his sixth studio album for his meditations clamour to be heard from the bitter opening gambit smith clearly has a point to make but it would feel like a disservice to define it precisely smith admits to having songs change their meaning to him years after recording them ; he prefers a more open approach one that places value in the mystery of a song and its many nuanced interpretations then could have any message youd like it to and its this quality that makes the album so powerful and engaging the real strengths here are less metaphorical than musical smiths last album 2011s 4everevolution lacked his prismatic charm but is a stonking return to form for the bass culture mixologist n addition to a fidgety footwork-esque production from four tet and the two cold futuristic cuts from switchs with you outfit and crookers ( and ) drops funk soul blues and even classical elements into the melting pot t doesnt always fit together some parts decidedly clash but its not supposed to be a slipstream experience is a jagged journey with purposeful peaks and troughs the album begins aggrieved and aggravated thick with melodrama but dont be too taken in ts just melodramatic for the hell of it says smith something to remember when the moody mid-section ( and up ) arrives jest is everywhere on be it in the subtle poke of a crying baby sample on or more blatantly as in dont a classic roots manuva jive with a poppy neo-soul streak courtesy of barry white t finally breaks down on the most sincere track here this one features classical virtuoso max richter and its his hand over the composition that turns those melodramatic strings in into something more profound and poignant even though the majority of was overseen by adrian sherwood (together with a young producer named fred) the fluctuations havent been flattened but rather allowed to flourish ts evidence of symbiosis with smith and the wonderful incongruences of his character his personal stamp is all over the albums fractured makeup its ambiguity and slippery resolve smith never went away exactly but feels like as storming comeback
is the debut record of berlin-based artist posch when i emailed her recently she told me shed been djing and making music for a decade before meeting soren jahan who co-runs the supply label with john barera while working at a bar i remember the first evening i showed him my music she said the funniest and weirdest tracks sounds like the work of a strong personality working across several styles techno electro house the albums tracks are bold yet simply constructed same could also be said of say early omar-s 12-inches some shared qualities are worth noting: interlocking grooves gritty sound and a big impact drawn from just a few elements yre danceable tracks that never feel over-produced is sometimes funny and weird in the way posch described but its not too out-there across various club-friendly styles her individual voice emerges gets more intense as it goes though its path upwards is more of a zig-zag than a straight line title track drizzled with poschs whispers is a mysterious and slightly trippy opener following track has a completely different charge tart and playful it has a buzzer sound on every beat attitude is another important part of poschs music s final a-side track captures this best its a snappy hybrid of electro and techno with chopped vocals and booming kick-clap percussion res also a memorable line from posch who sings: i woke up and i realized / that i love my life drum pattern is equally likely to stay stuck in your head s club sounds whether sweet or aggressive suggest considerable craft speaking about the albums range posch said: this was really important for me because as a dj i play techno and i wanted to show the world my little secret i kept for years at the moment posch herself is a secret as well but after such a modest and striking debut she may not remain one for long

has his hands in so many pots that just a brief glimpse of his work over the last decade would probably exhaust my word limit whether the berlin based englishmans behind the boards for artists like he rapture racey horn and new order acolytes delphic or rehashing pop artists like cortney idwell or goldfrapp an excellent two disc collection of his remixes was amassed by k7 in 2007 pearson seems almost omnipresent namechecked in news briefs and pr sends for new projects right around the bend hats of course without taking into account the mans work in partial rts or his dj gigs which has led to two commercial mixes: the electro house snapshot of the inaugural sci fi hi fi for soma and the pop techno mashes of fabric 35 but for his third market mix re proud of choices pearson finds perhaps the perfect home for his tastes in and warm buoyant dance tracks that rarely extend far from their pop framework drawn to the label by classics like michael mayers immer dj kozes ll people my friends and superpitchers day pearson was very conscious of making a mix all trademarks included he result is one of the brightest more effervescent commercial mixes of the last few years and a natural link to the labels past successes setting its sights on evening mood setter more than late night burn choices slowly bends from pulsating tech house to electro and downtempo indie without shedding its twilight stroll pace warming up with the stretch and yawn paces of gold s remix of s and s pearson establishes choices tone if not its predominant pace early on racks like s and k s imes o are in full recline lending a spaciousness and slow growth before aron rekkas and by begin to steam and bubble with their warped vocals and eerie bass pounce s the cut accelerates pearson reaches arguably the mixs first minor peak with the jagged pianos and clipped shouts of s but the transition is subtle and uncontrived a natural evolution before the petar take on reshers he a staple of pearsons sets last year retreats a bit with its warbling sci fi grind despite the coziness beneath even its headiest moments choices submerges in a few deep diversions in the near growl and acid scorch between s nalog and the gravelly hop of ink needles remix of s a ravel for the most part though pearson follows s tradition of prioritizing emotive melodies over provocation and forward push an effect exemplified by his refined and seamless mixing winding down with the bumpy chimes of john alabots remix of l s and two indie pop cuts that remind of pearsons remix work his edit of s and botoxs a gorgeous closer which sounds like nathan fake producing a radio pop song choices is slow to release you from its warm bed grip hough pearsons likely to be criticized for his lack of risks and the mixs sonic uniformity are proud of choices is exactly what he set out to make: the next good mix if its not another immer well shit you may have been asking too much
connects original us deep house with its european adherents on its new compilation the london label collects tracks from two midwestern heavy hitters: the chicago dream house legend and the tlanta via detroit veteran they supply one track each for the side while the side stays european with tunes from a student of the midwestern sound and the ukrainian producer the ep finds a great balance between these artists if you were listening blind it would be hard to say who made each track reins things in on his stripped down banger its title likely refers to the roland machines he used percussion is the tracks focus as rough hats dip and dive like a menacing relief records bonus beat sounds like larry heard forced to sample from a cd of comedy sound effects a screaming man and an elephant both feature in his smooth as silk juno jam moody and jacking is a close cousin while s blissful piano heavy lives up to its title it folds stately strings an affable bassline flute and a clavinet style synth into a joyful melody
decon/recon 1 launches a new series on paula temples reflecting the labels desire to promote a collective non-hierarchical approach to dance music its a collaborative record but an unconventional one samples from all contributing artists were collected in an open archive which they all then used as the source material for a new production all of the tracks have been credited to all four producers the intention being to break down traditional ideas of authorship this opening installment features artists from temples extended circle: rroxymore oni ayhun planningtorock and temple herself (the latter two appear as aquarian jugs and jaguar woman respectively ) its tempting to make guesses as to who did what there are some pretty heavy clues but thats not in the spirit of the thing instead its fun to pick out the common thread binding together these four diverse productions mostly its the saxophones with its swung drums and shoulder-shrugging bassline could be a masters at work-style deep house number but its maw run ragged those unruly sax melodies sliding into dissonance the track is slowly bled of its jittery energy leading nicely into the moodier this time the saxophones form wispy chords over a brooding rhythmic chassis; on theyre sliced into micro-loops that ride undulating waves of tension and release both of these middle tracks follow more conventional techno contours and do so effectively but the deeply weird closer steals the show its globular melodies patter like rainfall forming asymmetrical shapes over a slouching electro beat the whole thing shuffles oddly along before regrouping for a gorgeous downtempo coda stylistically jumbled decon/recon 1 isnt quite the unified front its creators might have hoped but as a study in the different places you can reach from the same starting point its fascinating
as a young tunisian probably has a lot to say she saw her home country undergo a revolution that initiated seismic political activity across the middle east as a resident of ulouse (tunisia is a former french colony) shes linked with an international electronic club underground that would be tougher to access from tunisia her debut ep has influences from her home country but it feels more aligned with the hard-edged style you might hear at a european club night like janus s title is a portmanteau of the names of the tunisian activist and the famed 13th century persian poet jal l ad-d n muhammad r m (known to english speakers as rumi) abdelwahed uses vocal samples of the former to gesture towards the latter s voice in arabic sounds agitated matching a squealing metallic loop and restless footwork-inspired percussion while its a clear political statement and a call to action the other three tracks may be more successful because of their less militant atmosphere all three feel bouncy with an unusual sense of funk written for the queer community stands out with its mellifluous vocals which are treated to create intersex inter-human references
one of the choice cuts from s trust it album stupdisco is prime dancefloor material its new mixes ensuring a huge response during the ibiza summer with a controversial video to match (scantily clad boxing and a hastily cut voiceover from a us politician ) the publicity machine is already gathering momentum the original is still the best though the euphoric vocals an entirely convincing 80s send-up set to heavier four to the floor beats lee-cabrera s mix is tougher and quicker more pumping whilst the hott 22 vocal mix goes heavy on the gallic flavour john julius knight s up-tempo mix is also fine fodder completing an excellent set of mixes surely one of the house tunes of the year

for a long time lurked in the shadow of its cofounder lone it was only last year with a string of rumpled house eps that the label began to sound distinct from the producers bright nostalgia but releases from project pablo bruce trail and gnork with their languid grooves and easy melodies were still friendly ep 1 a collaboration from mood huts cloudface and brooklyn producer patricia isnt so much both artists are known for muted sleep-fuzzed house and ep 1 showcases a sound so deep its almost disconcerting titles hint at the general effect and suggest falling but pleasantly tracks slow in tempo dull in sound seem to be in a state of decline and not much bothered about it on burnished house chords and a muffled 303 lick waft over a hollow low-end reminiscent of kassem mosse is angstier its stiff bassline sending purls of dissonance bouncing into the dark space around it takes on another meaning on whose melodies tumble like snowflakes over a gentle idm beat its a moment of respite but it doesnt last on the closer the drums resume their deathly trudge and minor-key chords moan like a distant gale in an empty landscape

this third release on shanti celestes label may be s debut 12-inch but his music has already made it into the right hands lena willikens call super and the hessle audio trio have been playing unreleased tracks for well over a year his bassy techno cut stasis 113 seems particularly popular among them although it doesnt feature on the ep which finds the leeds-based artist working at lower tempos a 110-bpm track is warm-up material right wrong is far too fierce to set loose on an empty dance floor from the off theres a turbulence beneath the snapping drums that doesnt take long to overflow deftly orchestrates the organised chaos that swells over the angry bassline he smartly pulls it all back to leave djs a minute of crunching drums to mix out of the title track is a sleazy house/ebm crossover the sort of thing that would fit nicely alongside your dark entries and c meme records is the slowest of the lot unfurling into a subdued funk reminiscent of tolouse low trax instead of nailing down one style s debut suggests an adventurous young producer full of ideas leaving you guessing which direction he might take next
samurai and auxiliarys project has a familiar aim: to present electronic music without context or identity no credits no info no expectations its not an attempt to be mysterious but rather to emphasize how both labels have moved on from drum bass and conventional dance genres the idea is that the music on exists in its own world that said the tracks on the first -inch arent completely unconventional but they definitely sit in a distinctive space (i e the atmospheric realm of artists like asc sam kdc and others on the samurai roster) 00 lays out a vague blueprint for this sound oriented around techno but not beholden to its static pulse two of the tracks have an exaggerated swing that aligns closer with dubstep which is evident in the way the snares smack up against the end of every measure theres an ungainly weight to this music and functionality doesnt seem like a main concern on the bassline is a vague ominous thing that rumbles in slow motion while on the drums feel like they lag behind its shuddering pace and glacial like epic dub techno barely feels like its moving at all only hints at drum bass tempo though here that speed registers as more wobbly than propulsive all four tracks float in and out like mist on the horizon offering a spin on ambient techno ideas so while its not all groundbreaking the first record is at least pretty different
replete with uber-trendy vowelless name operates somewhere in the heretofore neglected realm between bass music and the kind of red-eyed nocturnal r b so beloved by that sector (think weeknd drake and so forth ) but instead of merely making vague references or putting out unofficial remixes copenhagen-based steven jess borth ii produces his own brand of the dark stuff altogether viewed through the eyes of a staunch dub fanatic on his debut album borth alternates between filling the wide expanse of nighttime silence with full-throated vocals and the icy breath of chopped samples underlining the albums songwriting with a burialesque touch indeed dub is the (sometimes buried) beating heart of its not always readily apparent but the genre (and attitude) informs everything from sound design to structure doesnt get lost in allegiances to genre or orthodoxy though it instead figures itself as a consummate nighttime pop album classy and unobtrusive with just enough paranoia and edge to keep it from slipping into lounge fodder crucial to the albums surprising accessibility doesnt bury his pop songs in swirls of ambience or overcomplicated structures nor are low-frequency discourses particularly prevalent some of s beats owe something to dubstep and garage ( ness ) while others are content to repeat their non-aligned progressions patiently in true dubby fashion albums soundstage is uncluttered and unerringly clear as elements are introduced and pulled back at will with tracks like of and acting as digital updates of producers like perry pablo and tubby three minute chunks of gently unstable rhythm and sound manipulation vocal tracks glimmer in brilliant clarity while the cutups buzz and hum spewing candy-sweet melodies like those r b touchstones mentioned above otherwise sparse album is also full of little surprises like the shoegaze touches on the wheezing of light machinery or the glimpses of four-to-the-floor pulse that surface periodically to subtly push the tracks forward res something about that feels unassuming a sense of stillness that would be idyllic if it werent for the albums thorough dedication to soundtracking the unseen nocturnal its an album of gorgeous sounds and textures that prefer to lay in the dark and be discovered rather than assert themselves pay close enough attention though and itll be an album whose formidably conceived world haunts you for much longer than its runtime
if you really want to hear you cant be doing much else while you listen to it the only time im suitably unbothered by any other stimuli is the hour or so i toss and turn before actually falling asleep so lately ive been switching off all the lights climbing into bed with my headphones and giving latest my undivided attention before drifting off needless to say i havent been sleeping especially well darren cunninghams fourth full-length as is a disconcerting listen its long abstract agitated and seedy with tentatively intriguing passages followed by wholly frustrating ones its got the vibe of a condemned city block and all the atmosphere of a moldy fluorescent-lit basement given any opportunity to be distracted youll happily lose cunninghams thread within a beat or two you might forget the record was on until well after its over has never been in the business of making easy records of course but taken together his past three albums chart the evolution a truly singular voice: splazsh sharpened hazyville s expertly damaged techno a key influence for our current glut of proudly lo-fi dance-not-dance producers before r i p lifted off into the starry sky beyond the smog pitched as a kind of sequel to hazyville if not cunninghams final album returns to earth and doesnt like what it sees the albums opening gambit should weed out the weak and you cant blame them the first cut has the loopy endlessly tripping feel of splazsh highlight hubble but its groove never overcomes the overwhelming dankness of the production same goes for the next few tracks which move from unfocused burst to simplistic sketch unimpeded the section lands at the pure digital sludge of which sounds like a bad r b mp3 ripped to youtube and played off a waterlogged netbook there are glimmers of old spark here chunky and low-slung should get your head nodding at least but this first half hour or so feels like a death march things do start to turn though call it a smolder beneath the ashes the steamy tension of the watercolor tones of and the dilla-tinged groove of (a kind of listenable counter-image to ) betrays some of the brilliance often found on records still these wisps come smeared in noise dulled by overprocessing or built from notes so tightly clustered its hard to tell one from the next dont stop the music sings one of s only discernable voices on dont you might wonder if youre being taunted if does find at the end of the line then are we to hear this as cunningham taking us all down with him should we miss him less when hes gone for making an album devoid of the magic weve come to expect i and many others wont enjoy this record but those of us who listen intently may come to accept it doesnt sound like the work of a producer whos no longer able to make wondrous music; theres enough craft and intention here to suggest that for whatever reason he just didnt this time
were used to guillaume coutu-dumont twisting everything from jazz drum battles to hindu spiritual music into house tracks but his latest offering for his long-time home largely forgoes the magpie habits in favour of rolling loops both and ll swap the mildly manic air of gdcs sample-heavy creations for something more restrained former especially is nothing more than a four-note piano riff over scratchy percussion and it evokes a meditative air best-suited to a post-party cool off ll starts as softly as the -side finishes but over its nine minutes morphs into a dyed soundorom-style groover led by hi-hats that chatter like warring sparrows gdc says its designed for a stuffy obscure low-ceiling groove box and its hard to think of anywhere more appropriate to get lost in its undulating bass compared to these more hypnotic moments highlight is vintage gcd riddled with bongos call-and-response percussion and oddly disembodied vocals its a sunlit terrace jam that gives way to a wobbling bassline that wouldnt sound out of place in a slam set this is weirdo dance music at its best
irish producer sometimes hits a sweet spot with his tracks where conceptual consistency meets structural fortitude that his infamous color series of singles and subsequent 6x6 36 project comprise his best productions to date suggests without the buttress these concepts provide he flails a little (though if anything links and its one of the constants of all costellos techno tracks: his fondness for (prosaically put) old sounds ) this goes some way toward explaining why has me thinking more of the human leagues the dignity of labour ep than say studio 1 or concept 1 the tracks grounded by a simple naked arpeggio pattern straight from the early 80s school of nascent electro-pop and like the aforementioned human league record it shivers with protean grace variations come from minute changes in the pattern or swooping gliding synth sweeps that smear the background as though a painter has suddenly applied a roller to the most delicate of canvases this breaks up s pointillism quite nicely though in the end its a mood piece: lovely to listen to achingly poignant if youre in the right mood but slightly flimsy shares its flipsides emotional tone its pensive and slightly melancholy which proves theres not much separating of now from the costello who produced moist sad-eyed ambience for mille plateaux s descending melody drifting into earshot around the two minute mark glints and glimmers like tears rolling down a porcelain dolls cheeks and this combined with the hissy insistent rhythm track reminds a little of phex twins selected mbient works 85-92 something i certainly wasnt expecting nd while is almost methodical in its plotting of slight variations on a theme its highly effective almost hypnotic great single then though i suspect costellos going to be working a while longer to make it out from under the color seriess shadows

like so many experimental synth artists makes a lot of music in addition to playing in bands like zombi and titan last year alone he partnered with daniel osullivan for a synth pop album as miracle and released two full-lengths under his own name his new album on the increasingly prominent could be his most high profile solo release yet moore has been doing this kind of thing for a long time now and a certain knowing quality shines through from the billowing opener to the throbbing closer these feel like full and considered compositions rather than improvisations is an apt term for how moore structures each piece letting new layers wash over each other as his sounds interact and mingle in more ruminative moments like and the title track moore reaches an emotional resonance that falls somewhere between the sublimity of emeralds and the more theatrical end of tangerine dream the title track also features something else crucial to : percussion in this case a metronomic thud that grounds the songs eight-minute sprawl moore does something similar on which might sound like a slowed-down techno banger if it had more than just a faint heartbeat beneath it but as moore revealed in 2012 he doesnt care much for dance music which isnt what hes trying to do here anyways the percussion is just another facet in his soundscapes is equally rewarding to those who dive in and devour every minuscule detail as it is to those who listen more passively the lps title (a reference to a future supercontinent ) hints at some idealized coming together of disparate parts its this very sense of completeness that makes so engrossing

despite the rising disquiet about record store day it still brings about killer records a four track compilation is one of s unfortunately only 100 people will get their hands on it an ultra limited collaboration between the labels lowmoneymusiclove seekers and yay it comprises four house cuts heavy on bass and ethereal synths youll find dreamy afterhours bliss and more upfront sounds all executed with a level of class that deserves a wider circulation beyond these 100 records the tunes produced by affiliates of the labels are stripped back with most of the focus on percussion and mind bending bass this especially goes for from offenbachs markus sommer and phil evans its deep and rhythmic bassline which seems to be in a permanent state of descent is even more psychedelic than the sci fi melody its paired with roderick merkx and tjeerd wijffels deliver their first release as with a slamming house roller with bleeps and shuffling hats while s matches another deep and melodic bassline with snappy drums and a pensive melody s scatterbrained is the eps most percussive cut with a more frantic vibe than the rest of the tunes anyone hoping to dazzle dance floors with these tracks needs to be fast and lucky this record store day
certainly has a formula and its up there with some of the most threatening techno around but as matt unicomb astutely noted in his review of last years masif the music is rarely in a hurry often skulking about at some menacing house pace the tracks that shine brightest are seismically groovy ones when matched to looped vocals as in zelo off 2011 debut album flaws pamfago s body and here in heavyweight opener s potent trademarks take a turn for the terribly catchy embodying an even rarer singalong techno gem that once lodged can be hard to remove and does just that its a prickly dystopian hip-hop burr sounding like some updated and synthesised version of what justin k broadrick and kevin martin might have devised as animal the rest of the ep is taking a more steeled and slamming approach with and doing the forward-throttle thing hes more than capable of still they pale in comparison to the kind of impact makes on that first indelible listen reins it all back in for one of the industrial-funky numbers that have made the greek artistss movements such a treat to follow

when you share an ep with other artists do producers get extra competitive do they rush to the download charts to see how they are selling and then perhaps send malicious tweets to their rivals in the case of the shawarma ep there appears to be a clear winner o p ts is an odd little record part soul jazz noodling part bludgeoning old school new yawk house which almost threatens to submerge it such is its ferocity ndr s carries an emotional heft courtesy of its twinkling synth coda effervescent snare hiss and squelchy bass but is just that tad too linear which means the gold medal bouquet of flowers and a kiss from mum goes to s listen carefully and youll hear proper vinyl record crackles but its primary winning tenets are its firing discordant tom toms and snares which get eqed to within an inch of their lives that it teases you by threatening to blast through the roof at any moment although just about keeps its reserve is part of its charm
oth the ndrew grant lomez tunes here fall into rather pleasantly nondescript territory each are well-produced dub house grooves but lack that little something to really make them stand out wicky is a nicely reduced brew of swollen sub and chunky beats that aims to hypnotise as it swings pendulously back and forth the lines are long and unbroken the gentle chords are comforting and the slicing hi-hats are subtle yet kinetic is still somewhat insular but is less business-like allowing more colour and reverential emotion into the clipped jamie jones-like bottom-end than the more physically focussed opener the same track gets the dj qu treatment and becomes a wholly different beast now with many different focus points the strength music boss vision is a nebulous ecosystem of squelchy acid pricks shimmering rhythms and bulbous xylophone melodies its not unsettling exactly but seems to skip between shadows lurking only briefly before hurrying off around the corner once again
they may sound like characters out of a comic book and accordingly they make music that would soundtrack a caper quite well a caper in space specifically as its title suggests and s 12 inch release is an electronic update on kraut rock with the live drumming of someone like klaus dinger done up by trusty drum machines s lone solo effort here opens proceedings is spacious and welcoming a track whose searching melody provides much of the action its the same line thats taken up in and s the tune pumps at a healthy clip faster than dinger could ever reasonably have operated at while various whirring blooping and beeping frantically takes place around it in ever increasing number (it may just be the most exhausting trip down the aural autobahn youll ever take ) turns up solo on the flip with his trademark wavering analogue kit is filled with the sort of sounds that you could label cheesy if you werent being careful plone and plaids early work are easy reference points so is jean jacques perrey two more collaborative tracks close out the release: is the wonkiest of the batch its slightly awkward riff is frustrating to these ears especially considering how much and drive it home throughout but its also clearly the most original of the tunes on offer it sounds like at least five machines are simply left looping while the duo left the room not so with which is a lovely comedown from the previous tracks maniacal pace its soft beat and tender melody should end (or begin) plenty of mixes to come
fter donkeys years in the business running the traum empire scored a hit with his first solo twelve in this year the track like his steve arnes collaborations was characterised by an epic ambience and of course the classic heavy minimal sound at the centre of his triumvirate of labels its success was not only due to its eerie subtle and distilled dub-disco sound but above all the sweeping and emotive string arrangement this remix project succeeds however by placing the beauty of the strings in different beat environments oth sides of this record easily equal the original dominik adds his signature minimal sound to light in a mix that is not far from reinhold s original albeit with less layers a sharper edge and a psychedelic effect which stretches over a longer period deed the ten-minute duration of the track is a big plus: t home it gives the track an air of hypnotism and peacefulness but one can also imagine it as the cornerstone of a dj set used in segments here and there over an extended period also makes the most of the string samples playing games of nuance with them gently fusing them and the beat into one another the result is a beautifully cohesive stream of music with plenty of pauses and changes on the -side is a remix from the rather mysterious msterdam-based patrice umel who seems only to have managed two 12 s for trapez in two years his effort is not quite so bucolic cut at 45rpm rather than 33rpm it is more club friendly and races steadily to the finale umel fills out a solid detroit-style bass kick with tense dub-like runs and well crafted rhythm changes to create the illusion of speed with a heavier sound umel needs less emphasis on the strings but when they do weave in underneath the effect is breathtaking and it seems impossible to imagine that both sides are derived from the same track spectacular record
label mindful of the publics expectations after so many dj harvey records warily announces that its time for something completely different to be precise some japanese techno that tag barely begins to describe the liquid grace of acise 2 at the start the rolling groove feels faster than it is with swung kicks leaning forward into bubbling percussive accents; as it builds the groove rolls off the balls of its feet and back onto its heels balanced by reassuring handclaps on the 2 and 4 sense of tension tugged towards electro in one direction and house in the other finds a kind of resolution in soothing chords and bright arpeggios that go zipping up the major scale gatto apparently was the one that discovered the track for (its a co-release with his morto label) thats not surprising: you can guess from the sound of his remix how urgently he wanted to get his hands on this his drums are even tougher flattening out the swing of the original into straight 16th notes with an even more pronounced electro pattern if it sounds fuller than the original thats thanks partly to colorful synthesizer chords that billow out in slow motion; a plunging bassline thick as a bridge cable supports the tumble of motion above skudges version bears little resemblance to the original; theres a wash of background chords that might come from s track but the bulk of it is linear minimalist faintly acidic techno guarded and a little sour s a fine track in its own right but im a little surprised given the riches of the original that this is what skudge heard lurking inside rounds out the ep with to a gorgeous shimmering track for guitar and synthesizer drone halfway between durutti column and stars of the lid with a touch of stone roses for good measure japanese techno or no s balearic reputation is safe with this one
theres something more than a little manipulative in making a track full of rustling rhythms and languorous keyboard lines and deciding to go ahead and call it is it an option to hear such a thing and even entertain the notion that it sounds like anything other than well is there any room left for imagining in the end its probably not a great surprise that s stated tribute (an album track from the duos forthcoming follow my liebe ) lacks some of the roiling energy and aggro warmth of the better work by himself but its a serviceable simulacrum with a wide range of nicely articulated drum sounds and a great slow bassline that lays back and suggests more than it states the energy level stays more or less the same for eight minutes but then so did s (at least some of the time) two remixes up the action with an excellent turn by tiefschwarz for the first few minutes tiefschwarz takes all the little echoes and natters and taps in the original sizes them up and then builds a mix of them all into a tightly designed and funkily syncopated swirl then around the 3:35 mark theres an epic synthesizer breakdown that reduces everything to nothing for a spell before launching into an even bigger and tighter extrapolation on what was going on before theres even a key change a much different take by davide is sparse and austere by comparison and way less invested in the original but it works a nicely idiosyncratic herky-jerky house groove into something surprisingly spacious and spry
since launching in 2013 with a compilation ep that featured a kassem mosse track the label run by manchesters meandyou party has released no more than one record a year and only two of the six releases so far (including cassettes) have been solo endeavors point being its worth taking note of a new non-compilation record in the meandyou catalog and s is just that its ohio producer matthew mullanes first record as in five years following his lovely debut album for spectrum spools but fans of a sort of radiance might be surprised by these tracks nothing is beatless and the influence of kosmische and drone is minimal follows an appearance on this years the bookbinders ep where pink grid obscured dub techno nearly to oblivion just about everything here is more clear-headed and forceful though and that sharpness is an ideal approach for mullanes synthy sluggish techno tracks like and the title cut use their meaty kicks like punctuation dropping each thud pointedly between busy melodic sequences and a resonant bass throb ly and a portion of are straightforward enough for potential dj use and the former at about 100 bpm might only be useful for a druggy lull or calming wind down with all of its compositional eccentricities and analog quirks works more like a teaser for mullanes live performance than potent club fare and in that way its an enticing new chapter in s gently-paced story
sisay has been a presence in the uk underground for some time having collaborated with the likes of s trkt and jessie ware ut it was only last year that he stepped into the solo limelight with dual an ep of modern soul in which sisay revelled in his vulnerabilities whether emotional or sonic that in mind it makes sense that drake the man who has turned male vulnerability into a global brand brought the stalwart on board for his recent lp nothing was the same a demo of forms the chorus on the track of the same name this 7-inch which features the full version of s original plus a new song feels like an attempt to capitalise on the ensuing interest where dual derived much of its charm from unusual studio arrangements these are barebones piano-and-voice tracks recorded in what sounds like a couple of brief sessions this isnt a criticism per se after all youd be a fool not to court the drake fanbase while its looking your way and great records have been made with less ut these tracks might have benefitted from a bit more attention the chorus of is lovely this much we know already unfortunately the full version doesnt get much further is better its more structurally involved and sisays voice sounds more assured its probably the absence of s vision as a producer that makes both tracks a mild disappointment ut as an advert for the other two thirds of his talents his songwriting simple but affecting and his voice plaintive without ever indulging in self-pity they are wholly adequate
vicente has had a hand in some great records in recent years having co-founded the c meme label and worked as a producer on music by matias aguayo daniel maloso rebolledo christian s and se or coconut this ep for his label features two jacking and funky originals plus a slew of remixes on the title track winds a flamboyant male vocal ( i can tell a lot from the way you dance from the way you move from the way you jack ) around a tightly-coiled acid line and urgent high-pitched house keys could almost be a remix of the title track it grabs you in a similar way this time through flashing vocal fragments and a wonderfully down-and-dirty bassline the package includes five remixes of the title track the best of which comes from c meme duo djs who recast the vocal into something seductively ominous and compound the effect through growling bass pads and flinty percussion s atmospheric electro-house-tinted rework is a close second while harvard s interpretation which does little more than remove the acid line and andre and roman s remix which includes some heavier textures add little to the excellent original
one of music s shining light unleashes a one sided release on the imprint that is sure to destroy a dance floor or two and i can assure you it is quite the original mix is what is featured here and it is a pure anthem from the word go the track is quite heavy with a pulsating baseline joining forces with a haunting riff that keeps the track flowing at a very good and strong pace the breakdown midway sees a minimal electro base tone join the riffs as it builds and builds towards the re-introduction of the strong heavy beats and it is a moment that is sure to cause a bit of madness quite a big track from rivera and i must say it is quite addictive
enjoyed one of the most spectacular debuts in recent dance music memory with hyph mngo a track that quickly caught on with mary nne hobbs irritated simon reynolds and captivated wide swathes of the net listenership and not only diehard dubstep fans his second single makes it eminently clear that hyph was no fluke while he employs similar techniques here neither track feels like a retread where the full-bore hyph mngo and its backing track wet look exploded from the speaker cones like solar storms is remarkably restrained the rhythm still barrels forward swung kicks lurching determinedly rushing the beat with steady shakers on the offbeats greasing their path gain the soundfield is abuzz with glistening sawtooth synths with cottony vocal scraps swirling in middle distance lending an unmistakable sense of yearning ut syncopated chord stabs borrowed from midwestern merican house and techno counteract the forward motion holding back the beats the tune is more relaxed than hyph mngo but its still animated by a delicious sense of push-and-pull with the sense of drag heightening the drama as filters peel back stylistically j sounds more like hyph mngo unrelenting chopped-up vocal repetitions create an almost unbearable sense of tension hammering away at intervals that musical conviction dictates should resolve but withholding the resolution milking that electric sense of wrongness for all that its worth rhythmically its torn between two possibilities with rapid-fire 16th-note cymbals rubbing nervously against the vocal triplets while staggered kick drums halve the tempo for all its complexity theres not a sound out of place having burst upon the scene with such a mammoth tune as hyph mngo its to orbisons credit that hes confident enough to dial it back a notch with his follow-up ep for a producer so new to the scene his ability to balance force and control in the service of canny emotional manipulations suggest thrilling things ahead
all of tadd mullinixs projects are loaded with personality as dabrye he helped redefine cut-up hip-hop beats as james t cotton he took acid houses dna and spliced it with psychedelia and noise to devastating effect in recent years james t cotton has segued into jtc a more measured but no less vibrant outpost for house and techno another alias first emerged in 2002 but its only in the last few years that the project has come to the fore with albums in 2013 and 2015 the ingredients of maniers catalogue industrial ebm synthwave post-punk have a vitality that reaches beyond mere imitation manier channels the spirit of pioneering acts like cabaret voltaire test dept severed heads and front 242 through a modern arsenal of synths percussion and effects to make on a head-spinning whole there are lots of muscular sounds on thick sinewy synth lines flex and stretch underneath dense layers of texture on which does a handbrake turn into hardcore punk in its last eight seconds the modulating lead line on spits and snarls in response to the bitter lyrics much more cash than any of us comes the chant from a ghoulish voice a sentiment that echoes the political barbs of the post-punk era human voices play a key role elsewhere is led by a dissolving gurgle on the title track a disembodied voice is processed until it becomes pure abstraction the undecipherable yet melodic hook on the synth pop of for all its sonic abrasions feels strangely upbeat stands out for the expressive way in which mullinix wields his tools liberal amounts of modulation and processing give his machines an organic yet unsettling quality the layers are so intricate that it could take lots of repeated listening to peel everything back this overloaded style however is typical of mullinixs production where bold upfront elements jostle for attention its testament to his skill that everything in the mix feels balanced thrilling and unpredictable is a refreshing take on 80s electronic music present as these influences may be this is far from throwback music
when you think of the word you automatically reminisce about some of the finest mix compilations the electronic world has seen in the last 10 years be it the first mix collection by sasha digweed or some of the newest installations by the likes of james zabiela the quality of all the releases on the label is undeniable one dj who has encompassed that quality time and time again on the label is let s face it seaman has been behind some of the best mixes on the label from his stunning london mix to his early masters series mixes its his consistent ability to deliver solid impressive mixes that keeps him at the forefront it is also this ability that now sees him return to the front to deliver the seventh installment of the masters series disc 1 begins delightfully with a blessed out sasha remix of charlie may s seal clubbing a tune that opens the album with some smooth melodies and subtle beats some smooth basslines build into the mix courtesy of the buick project and the mix quickly gathers some pace thanks to some intense sounds by prawler and some smooth and funky riffs by the thievery corporation slacker s superb memory man keeps the juices flowing very nicely early on with some twisted riffs and haunting vocal hooks skystate deliver a pretty unique set of sounds with some uplifting stabbing synths while there s some vintage progressive in the middle section thanks to janicki s mix of hawaii and then the dub mix of buy me by nufrequency chab s sunrise starts to take the mix to the next level with some uplifting moments while montero s mix of for the time being is a driving delight with some filtered vocals and a sinister set of low end sounds john dahlback then delivers a superb remix of luke dzierzek s brilliant echo as the mix prepares to end on a bit of style with matthew dekay roob v s 2 da groove an emotive bit of driving progressive seaman himself gets in on the remix act with an anthemic 10-minute closing reworking of gabriel dresden s tracking treasure down the track has a distinctive sound that is both and and brings a very solid first disc to a nice close paradise soul get things moving on disc 2 with a smooth and somewhat funky opener dzierzek liousias team up to deliver a funky set of electro riffs in randoms while don t walk away by killahurtz continues to set the mood of the second disc with some gritty basslines and quirky drums luke dzierzek gets in on the act yet again this time with a sinister and addictive remix of i don t know by suicide sports club the mix continues its relentless beginning thanks to some twisted sounds courtesy of andy page and sean quinn while connected by sultan ned sheppard adds a bit of a melodic touch to the second disc a disc so far dominated by the dirtier and tougher sounds despite a melodic and uplifting breakdown sedna by the 16 bit lolita s continues the driving theme with some evil basslines as does chris lake with a delightful production in hype matt rowan then teams up with jaytech with tomorrow a bouncy and upbeat production that looks to take the mix out with some great vibes s mix of bedrock s santiago is full of melodic twirls and a smooth as silk bassline while luke chable sends down some delightful sounds and emotive pads with his stunning mix of shiloh s dream on it is then left to osamu m s superb remix of stoppage time to take the mix out in style as expected the second mix has a little more energy than the first disc thanks to some superb driving productions reminiscent of seamans early masters series mixes one good thing i will say about seaman is that he really always sticks to what he knows best while some other djs out there will be quick to jump on the latest bandwagon just to deliver a mix that will sell dave continues to play music that he believes in and he mixes it and delivers it in a way that works there are often not many dull moments in a mix and again this is true with some really big tracks thrown in amongst some smoother moments all mixed very well by the veteran at times there are questionable moments in the mix should this track have been here or go for as long as it did but overall the end result is quite solid and much like a typical mix it is energetic and exciting exactly how a mix should be
s hard to pick the best of the bunch of these four tracks such is their quality and variation all are culled from podgelism s compendium of remixes of seattle-based s 2004 album serial hodgepodge all four tracks respect the sensuality and sonic clarity of the original release with a marked reverence and intelligence robag is up first with his version of perhaps the most frantic of the four light and shifty at first it drops in and out of an urgent and driving bass run that just wont stay down s riddled with chiming changes and airy percussive lures that are just mesmerising and perhaps a little more mature than some of s more humorous and deconstructive work on the krause label apparat s shorter end to the first side is the most enigmatic track and although the least danceable it is still rhythmic and laced with post-rock flavours as well as a jaw-dropping hypnotism melancholy piano ambience of the original quickly caves in to fiery vibrations and determined emotions on the b-side john lays back and lets you get on top with it pure melodic sighs blend seamlessly with crunchy beats and scraping drone washes keeping up the steady pace for a comfortable and light-hearted afternoon s grind lastly lawrence repays the favour for s 2005 remix of night will last forever with a gently persistent take on the hamburg techno producer underpins it all with a 4-4 heartbeat and salty snares that work effortlessly to lift the pace of the original while the peaceful ambient drift is retained with chiming melodic freckles shine indeed
when dominick fernows project experiments with techno its signature horizontal sweep gets crushed into a ball fernow excels at telling a story with open spaces deteriorating textures allusive samples and controlled tension thats all there on nd but its linked to technos tight cycling circles which condense and blur the narrative into something more visceral it trades subtlety for bulk but the clang of metal and half heard background details make this more suggestive than your average techno fare lthough his work loses some profundity and originality in this mode its instantly recognisable in the context of a techno dj set if fernows side feels like choking on plumes of toxic smoke ncient side evokes a forced march ut as always the pump action stomp of his rhythms are deceptively funky each downbeat in eliefs is like a boot in the face but it lunges the dance forward with each repetition its oppressive but deliriously fun so extravagant that its invigorating
theres always room for new musical expressions from the intertwined relationships of dfa and its related artists so this project a collaboration between lcd soundsystems pat mahoney and dennis jee day mcnany should be welcomed with open arms is a one-track digital release and as such can only give so much away about what the pairs album due later in the year will be like if it features more of the same however a full-length treat is in the making an instantly arresting bass synth riff ushers in mcnanys vocal a lingering slo-mo inescapably david byrne-ish drawl regal percussion housey synth flourishes and magisterial drones join later as mcnany dreamily explores themes of travel and long-distance love
martin s first ep was just released on hamburgs and it positively drips with the bullishness of a producer just settling in a few missteps aside gives us a promising debut-in-earnest from the sound of it the eps title cut blasted off long before we reached it leaving with few viable options for fleshing it out for a track pointing so emphatically toward the ethereal feels rather weighted down by itself its dub chords perfectly wispy on their own but a little oppressive as wave after wave of them fill in every conceivable open space from here things get markedly better in gives us a good deal more breathing room letting its humbly plaintive melody sing out even when its chunky percussion is at its thickest flash-frying little bits of sampled melody in its hefty low end is the collections most conventionally club-ready track puffs itself out much like the title cut though its purposeful bass bounce keeps it pinned to the earth likely has much of his production career in front of him and while the ep leaves him with a pretty open road he certainly sounds like hes got enough passion to keep his engine running

rip it up and start again simon reynolds masterful chronicle of the post punk years singer gavin friday recounts how he once staged an art exhibition at a dublin gallery which involved a replica vagina made of raw meat surrounded by fresh turds and turned up the heating until the smell was outrageous its almost ironic then that the iconoclastic music of and their contemporaries north and south of the irish border should now be preserved almost as a museum piece itself strange passion: explorations irish post punk diy and electronic music 1980 1983 comes complete with encyclopaedic liner notes via cache cache an offshoot label of archivist imprint finders keepers seemingly intended to get historians rubbing their hands with glee rather than choking back vomit although the ritish and american movements of the time have been exhaustively dissected irelands scene during the same era has remained largely overlooked the focus always more on bands like u2 and my loody valentine who found fame in later years it does however seem that some of these bands were studying their counterparts across the irish sea as studiously then as musical scholars do today the dubby bass and lydoneseque sneers of s could have come off pils metal ox and youd wager that chant chant chant owned at least one clash record between them meanwhile others were casting their eyes over the atlantic instead whereas irish emigrants had taken traditional folk with them to new york centuries before bands like and were influenced by that citys fresh musical exports velvet undergrounds jangle on the formers while on the latter mainline the proto punk funk of bands like esg that would subsequently energise factory artists like section 25 however interesting as those artefacts are its the electronic music aspect of strange passion thats most fascinating many of the lyrics here subscribe to punks no future mentality but the synths on s are years ahead of their time; a missing link between suicide dfa and even early phuture style acid house this crossbreeding between punks earthiness and electronic musics extra terrestrial escapism is perhaps best exemplified by s which sounds like stranglers spittle flecked peaches being sucked up into giorgio moroders spaceship for where bands like clannad were churning out pastoral clich s of the emerald isle experimentalists like were turning the drab grey of council estates in dublin or derry into avant garde kaleidoscopes
like his magical res somebody out re marcellus pittmans the relies on what sounds like a pretty simple melodic hook but listen long enough and pittman starts to modulate things twist them ever so subtly and with a little synth hook and a deep bass hit offering a bit of an anchor it becomes ridiculously hypnotic its a head-nodder that likely makes even more of an impact on the floor which is seemingly standard operating procedure for perhaps the most unheralded member of the 3 chairs crew pittman has remained under the radar like most detroit artists by only releasing on his own label unirhythm and imprints run by close motor city friends thats likely not because hes suffering from a lack of requests though pittmans productions thus far have been stunning that much is obvious from things like which slows things down to a crawling tempo and garnishes the beat with a wailing disembodied diva that holds the same wavering note throughout almost its entire length switching things up for the finale is a cut-up focusing its attention on a loop that has enough organ yeahs and ohweohhhs to keep you interested far longer than the record lasts

you would think that gigolo and would be total opposites in terms of genre but leave it to relative newcomer to prove that the worlds of electro and techno are hardly unrelated san recorded his debut artist album for dj hell in 2006 a collection of electro that was detroit-flavoured yes but also sounded right at home on hell s eurobot-defining imprint gigolo sans newest 12-inch for carl craigs imprint also sounds right at home especially after craig s recent european adventures championing the likes of ripperton and uttrich san mixes the few pieces he has here perfectly like a minimalist painter that has pared everything down to its essentials its trance-y but only in the sense that it induces a trance-like state from sans expert raising and lowering of the tension its so expert in fact that c2 doesnt have many places to go on the -side on his edit he takes the synth line out for a test drive and then just decides to bring everything in at around the two-minute mark it strives for the austerity of his like a child remix but with all of the elements already in place there is little surprise and (dare i say it ) san has already beaten him at his own game on the -side anyway this is a release which will no doubt disappoint the detroit purists looking for craig to get with the d-town program but those with longer memories willing to acknowledge the longstanding trade of electro between europe and detroit it sounds almost traditional sans slavish devotion to drexciya on his idj record for example was plainly obvious and in the story of planet-e this 12-inch is the logical progression on from craigs recent infatuation with continental sounds in short it seems as if electro and techno are coming together again on this record at least that sounds like a good thing

its been nearly two years since safehouses rthur cayzers last ep as ; a release which functioned as an all-too-short summation of everything that was exceptional in british dance music at the time since then cayzer has become one-half of karenn alongside blawan and turned his hand to more visceral stomping techno cayzer returns here to the name and invariably a sound that takes influence from both projects on on the title track cayzer takes a stuttering 2-step-tinged rhythm and the ominous reverberations of an abandoned machine shop and forges them into a coherent whole compressed by enormous subsonic cables of bass that coil violently around the track that much of unfolds around cymbals that sound more like gasping steam pipes than ordinary percussion only adds to the menacing effect while the ghostly voices of instantly recall the twisted vocal manipulations of many uk producers the particular charm of the track is to be found in its own warped structure; loose rhythmic patterns stumble along held in place only by the delicate touch of subtly jarring keys and abruptly whispered entreaties following an unassuming start closer mong gradually swells as drifting pads envelop a whale call looming out of a labyrinthine concrete jungle recalling late 90s swans at their most melancholy it makes for a dark finale in line with everything else here given the results though one can only hope doesnt find the light at the end of this shadowy tunnel just yet
is clearly run by someone with a few names in his rolodex and a few favors to cash in its output so far has been limited to a focused selection of underground house heavyweights marko fuerstenberg i-robots and the very solid new act mod civil have all contributed to ornaments meaning the label has an unmistakable (and unsurprising) erlin center of gravity the biggest names yet appear here on the third installment from the imprint with two interpretations of s samuel an alias for dive himself opens things with an interpretation very much of the subtle and static style that cassy for instance has taken to extremes variety of merican cultural figures are named over an unemotive backing beat leaving dives track solidly in the mix fodder category (this isnt to say its unworthy indeed it will probably be a pleasure to hear this slot into house sets with unassuming ease ) moodymans take predictably is more memorable the detroit producer brings more melody a touch of cheesiness and dynamic breakdowns to the table without slathering too much of his trademark funky gravy over everything its probably not wild enough to cut through the stoned functional vibe that in the end overtakes this record though because is at its essence exactly what a limited release special edition erlin-oriented house record should sound like right now lthough the erlin scene deserves a huge amount of credit in fostering one of the most vibrant and creative musical communities of our time few people seem to be talking about the danger that the mass exodus to prenzlauer erg may be causing (i e too many artists beginning to speak with one voice ) lthough very good there is also something just a bit too familiar about if we arent already it might just be time to start wondering about the long-term influence of murky labels about which the main thing we know is that they get their mixing done at dubplates and mastering erlin

n searching for an appropriately scandinavian metaphor for this compilation settled on smorgasbord like the legendary scandinavian buffet there is an embarrassment of riches on the two discs here sleazy beats creepy atmospherics dreamy tones and a great diversity in musical ideas both from familiar tracks and also a wealth of new material but also like the smorgasbord they dont hang together to create a greater whole and taken all at once are somewhat indigestible now thats not to say there arent some fine moments (like perhaps finding some meatballs in the midst of your lutfisk) my favourite is probably s previously unreleased mix of brathens a mid tempo roller that veers off unexpectedly into worlds of wizardry and wild romance with gloriously over the top washes of sound hints of acid and mysterious fragments of talo melodies unashamedly trippy it makes good use of the slow tempo to create a drifting expansive mood thats harder to do at a faster clip and indeed much of the compilation is mid paced although probably too synthetic and gloomy to be labeled cosmic these tracks are more about mood than physicality and mostly evolve their themes gradually rather than seeking to grab the attention from the off this works well on and also on diskjokkes extraordinary where a simple swaggering groove turns into a demented collage of dinosaur screeches flanged zooming noises and rhythmic chirps as internally focused as they are these tracks still maintain vestigial dancefloor appeal this is not the case however on the weaker tracks such as s which meanders around the foothills of psychedelia instead of shooting off for the highest peaks and is weighted down beneath a beat that doesnt quite mesh fully ndeed clumsy beats plague a few of the songs here making for difficult listening at times towards the end of the unmixed disc the pace takes off: and are more straightforward dancefloor oriented disco goes for an early 80s jittery percussion and slap bass feel whereas is a bassline roller with funk guitar touches both are competent danceable tunes but remain somewhat anonymous the standout of the three is touched the hand of the much regarded ts slick speedy and trancey and is reminiscent of hi nrg while having a clanking toughness that makes it instantly more contemporary and as comfortable sitting in a techno set as a disco one there are two discs included here the second being a continuous mix (for the most part the unmixed disc focuses on previously unreleased material whereas the mix is the greatest hits portion ) the only point of crossover between the two is s an odd choice to highlight in this manner as it sounds like erotic discourse s retarded cousin we all know what a fantastic dj can be (and if you need convincing look no further than cosmic galactic prism ) but that isnt much in evidence here the basic trouble is that s sets are normally spiced with oddities and curios from the last 30 years of music whereas here he is restricted to the back catalogue don t get me wrong the back catalogue contains lots of fine music much of which appears on this cd however the label specializes in the bizarre and as such most of these releases sound at their best when dropped into a more straightforward mix to provide an unexpected twist and a bit of contrast taken all together it s too much of a good thing and proves more than a little wearying on the ears to make an analogy: jay and silent bob are funny in clerks because they only occupy about ten minutes of screen time give them a movie to themselves though and it stinks of course this is not a movie and due to the wonders of our age (also known as mp3s) you can choose which tracks to buy the unreleased material here contains some gems (as does the back catalogue) so give the mixed cd a miss and head straight for the good bits
while its tempting to draw parallels between this years big success stories hot natured and crosstown rebels as sam louis did back in august is a pretty clear indication of where the collectives differ louis very reasonably linked them on the basis of their much discussed move towards house music thats a bit slow(er) a bit sexy a bit melodic se descriptors certainly ring true for although as about a third of this mix illustrates theirs is an intoxicating journey like strain of tech house removed (to use a convenient example) from the kind of 80s dance party vibe that jamie jones of hot natured evoked on his fabric mix or (to use another convenient example) the delicate funk maceo plex of crosstown rebels proffered on his ra podcast s opening demonstrates this through a foggy 120 bpm passage formed from music by and if they appear synths gently nag rather than sing; basslines are dubby and under the constant cosh of a filter if youre au fait with the imprints output this year youll know that the other main facet of their sound is what seth troxler (one quarter of the collective alongside lee curtiss ryan crosson and shaun reeves) once called underground pop dalliances with vocals and more complete melodic phrases occur frequently throughout aril s remix of and the dj t version of phreek plus ones passion being two fine examples but are mostly underpinned by beats and bass for dancing its not until the mixs final stages that the kind of home listening material pushed by the label is explored unadulterated these two distinct flavours framed in the context of a single mix s primary plus point is the harmonious meeting between the two move into a four track decompression at the end feels natural and unhurried and aside from the misstep of sequencing franco s remix at a point (track 6) out of keeping with its mood (end of the night grandeur) nothing here feels superfluous or incoherent it is however worth mentioning the discs style of mixing as its not always executed successfully tracks are on the whole allowed to merge for minutes at a time with the hits and misses of this approach being exemplified around the mixs midpoint: transition from acidic into the excellent by favourite simply doesnt work; the mix out of the track into s while not harmonically compatible gives the desired effect of a gear change the mix being released in december some may have hoped for a year defining statement from one of the years defining collectives doesnt represent this and nor does it try to stead what we have is a well balanced representation of four guys that are continuing to creatively flourish; and if you do insist on grouping them one of the foremost mixes to come out of this recent fascination with slower house sounds

there s really an important place for slightly pedestrian records which sound on-trend t least there must be because there are so many of them and so many djs that play them i just didn t personally think that were in the business of releasing them nor of making them that might sound a bit harsh has a decent (and very familiar sounding) riff which is very deep house and is deployed in an agreeable enough manner and i m sure lots of people will play it but i want to be harsh here because just doesn t seem to have a big idea in it to capture the imagination the deep house style is there but where is the substance i really had to concentrate to avoid my thoughts turning to sunglasses or korean actresses or suchlike while listening nd frankly i expect more from these guys (e g southern comfort reverse charge klatta ) on the b side has a cheeky little two-note bass flourish that gave me hope but the track doesn t really go anywhere it simply meanders around flourishing the odd jungle noise or drum roll at the listener gain pleasant enough but where is the excitement if all that mattered in music was being up to date with the current style this would be a great release unfortunately it isn t
while drum bass undoubtedly has roots in hip-hop mcing has largely been relegated to live situations and done only in a hosting/toasting style in the odd cases where mcs have stepped into the studio its more on a track-by-track basis thus lynx kemos debut album is a rarity: a considered and coherent mc and producer collaboration between american-born german-based rapper kemo and british wunderkind producer lynx you can hear immediately why the two chose work together: kemos lazy but precise flow goes well with his deep smoky voice and fits perfectly to lynxs sparse beats a kind of urban industrial tribalism tinge is present throughout: lynx has developed a sample-heavy organic but rough edged sound that is refreshingly different from the polished synthetic approach that dominates drum bass today is reminded of the mid-90s work from producers like dillinja roni size and the bristol crew and the hip-hop stylings of danny breaks steady but subtle beats and rumbling and tumbling basslines of lynx breathe a little bit of life into the classic drum bass roller a form too often forgotten in these anthemic times kemos lyrics touch upon a variety of subjects hip-hop bravado and declarations of authenticity pervade album opener while paranoia and big brother feature on is a goose bump-inducing drum bass history lesson with kemo reciting the history of the genre referencing anthems of years gone by over a cheeky but clever beat that sneaks in licks samples and snippets from said anthems but as nicely as kemos vocals lend themselves to the music the various other vocal contributors arent as successful is half-grating on and doesnt do too much for on the calibre clone you better are the handful of instrumental tracks like the drum-sparse and bass-driven and the escalating climaxes of and as a result those aforementioned slight criticisms aside is a successful marriage of old vibes and new ideas highly recommended

earlier this year nticipate a new label run by ezekiel honig brought us curiously titled but lovely debut album from mark templeton standing on a hummingbird the inaugural release is followed by poetically named a strangely satisfying album from ny based packard and honig are of same new york ilk as microcosm records: y explore warm electronic beats improv and a host of o r narrow and fruitful paths the emphasis is on live performance but y also make elegant recordings honig and packard s microcosm collaboration from last year for example is built on loops skips and folds of electronics and live instrumentation though two of instruments are among my least favorite: accordion and saxophone packard manages to transmute m well enough into structure to sufficiently abrogate effects the album has a heaviness that belies title t brings to mind tim hecker of haunt me and radio mor though second track is experimental in more of a delay/agf vein with its mysterious vocal sample the weight of music which comes from lush chords and textured stabs is balanced by a delicacy in structures and this parity gives album overall lugubrious grace of an old zeppelin ts depth and pace can offer solace and rejuvenation on a quiet afternoon the album is one half of a package that includes a dvd of material drawn from a live performance with artist joshua ott otts smooth abstractions are a good fit with packard s sound; a nice taster for what must be more impressive live

gerry read is easy to like with the list of reasons headed by his uncompromising attitude to music you cant see him tweeting about the quality of inflight champagne or throwing a victoria sponge into the crowd any time soon the suffolk lad returns to having squirrelled himself away to produce two tracks that further illustrate a rapidly maturing production nous while still bristling with youthful energy its worth remembering that despite his ubiquity these past couple of years hes still only 21 is a game of two halves opening with gossamer vocals dreamily wandering across a minimal soundbed of growling bass and 909 claps then read presses the boost button and the track quickly develops into a twisted tech funk barrage with manic hi-hats leading the charge in contrast is a chance to draw breath deep detroit chords wrap themselves around a tremulous bassline and an itchy rhythm its a glittering slab of summery bouncing house

of the vintage us house producers currently having their catalogues trawled through seems to be undergoing the biggest revival ts not hard to see why most of the tracks being rereleased are relatively stripped back and able to slot in to just about any house set imaginable with minimal fuss the latest record to be dusted off is a four-track 12-inch originally released on in 1991 ts hard to pick a standout cut as they each pack an equal amount of charm and punch kicks things off and is the most maximalist thing on offer with horns vocals and keys combining for six minutes of quality classic house ts all about percussion on cant and s jammin both are heavily swung with kick drums thatll be lapped up by any dance floor that they were produced 20 years ago makes all the more impressive with proving that to craft a house weapon all you need is the right combination of rhythm and bass

mike shannon and david dewalta kochs second adventure continues the theme set by last years no rest for the wicked on cynosure thats druggy digital tech funk perhaps its a reaction to dewaltas classically-trained upbringing but theres only the subtlest evidence to suggest that he once played in a symphony orchestra like the muted swirling horn-like pads that infect oth the -side and the flip smooves lock into a groove early and march relentlessly on like zombies each unfurling over ten sprawling minutes whose digital-only dub is oddly indiscernible from the original has a jazzy drum lick as its musical plinth on which is stacked a rising bass motif and rattling analogue synth phrases its positively sweetness and light compared to the deeply twisted smooves imagine being at watergate at late oclock looking out over the spree at that point where the darkness is at its richest its exactly what youd want to hear chugging dubby echoes battle ghostly rimshots and atmospheric background noises that sound like roaches scuttling across the kitchen lino
is a supergroup made up of canadian breakcore demon venetian snares red hot chilli peppers guitarist john frusciante and winnipeg noisemonger chris mcdonald this is their first release and its pretty difficult to tell apart from venetian snares solo material particularly since he spans a lot within his signature chaotic electronics i think its ace but whether you like this will depend on your inclination to appreciate the remarkable order and precision in snares pseudo-randomness maybe its the presence of a guitarist that helps place this near the lyrical end of snares own catalogue but is more electronic than orchestral more disjointed and unhealthy the rhythms here are made up of numerous strands but it doesnt take too hard a listen to pick them out from each other well defined as they are: metallic zinging noodling synth squiggles scraping gypsy violins a dazed bass which wanders aimlessly through the spectrum in its one-note-a-bar plodding amongst many others ut the nice thing here is the way the digital mass grows and drifts organically a result of the way they work; writing parts in reaction to others parts and then dropping them in and out as they record live to stereo together with no edits
rocket number nine take off for the planet venus was a tune by psychedelic jazz eccentric sun ra but its not just his improvisational trips around the solar system that have influenced en and tom page theyve been touring recently with four which makes sense given the way values glowing but imperfect emotion as the end to which all means point lso in the picture is sun ra and miles davis drummer and mutual friend steve reid to whose memory the record is dedicated; clattering drums and rhythmic drive are toms rustic wooden support structure to his brother ens shining keyboards with a session for gilles peterson also under their belt theyve come to the fore recently and judging by itll be very interesting to see where they go from here here though they produce an entrancing thirteen minutes of meandering post-rock eeking power from the melodic and rhythmic simplicity in a way that could work nicely as an innovative centrepiece to a warm and playful club set akin to pparats recent dj-kicks the kick is constant and the drums clatter and roll well the first half would work at least pattering and proud like the start of a crusade but then after a throbbing lull the second half sighs like the bittersweet aftermath of a battle that changed everything evoking hope and regret at the same time hebden obviously thinks the two-part structure is a good idea because he keeps it but applies a massive growling bassline and stonker of a kick aiming squarely for dance floor decimation thats a pretty surprising phrase to be used in reference to hebden even considering his lean towards clubbiness of late other features are more familiar: a shiny and sturdy analogue riff quirking its way throughout the choppy acoustic drums strapped straight in from the original and trademark oscillating toned wooden percussion it doesnt change as much as the original though; it seems some things at least are too experimental for him where the club is concerned (as usual this is a double-edged sword) like the original however it brings the wandering prog-out up to date in a way thats both nostalgic and refreshing
segment continues to push fresh uplifting prog sounds with the first instalment of the year coming from the teaming of house impresario nick hook and moussa clarke aka both artists are no strangers to the limelight having impressive back catalogue of releases and chart successes in lengthy careers on the scene gets two takes the first of which is the letarno mix steve finney grabs kelia phillipsz original vocals and creates a peaky dose of beats around it kicking off from the start with an energetic blend of contorting synth sound and steady percussive roll the bassline is added notching up the pace a little while the track begins to develop more percussive elements are added before dropping out leaving just the vocal taking control of the mood driving ahead and breaking once more before breaking again with a more broken groove nice side b has a nick hook mix dubbing down the mix with deep stabby basslines and less busy percussion using elongated eerie pads and delayed sounds to give it motion its effect is more subtle as by the end a blissful melody has crept in finishing up on a high
the ep was a bold step forward for the india-born italy-based artist where an exploration of her roots merged with fearsome sound design that veered between steely and soulful holly dicker mentioned a sha as a reference point in her review a perceptive observation is on the team assembled here to deliver four remixes the emotional tension so prevalent in s work is instantly identifiable on her mix of which draws upon multiple tracks from the original ep from rapid gunfire to straining vocal touches the interplay between violence and tenderness merges with singes style beautifully the haunter regular weightausend takes a much subtler approach to riding on a wave of shruti box tones before letting rip with some intricately configured drums zuli uses an extensive range of digital tools on his version of crafting a densely packed slice of crunching electronica thats aligned with the post-club spirit of the original jesse packs percussive heft into his version of the emotive 27 09 87 he handles the delicate melodic parts with poise remoulding them without losing their emotional resonance it highlights the richness in his and s sound not to mention the potential of this fertile corner of experimental electronic music
versatility is proving to be one of s defining traits its evident in her mixes and the way she tailors her productions to suit the labels she works with on her cocktail damore 12-inch seeks to capture the joy she saw at the berlin party in 2015 as ever her personality shines through its heard in the pumping spurts of acid that drive the taut opener ip and the sample used in the opening seconds of eart where a woman offers a snarky response to someone berating her smoking habit you can imagine eart a snappy disco number that builds to a dramatic crescendo sending the cocktail damore dance floor into a frenzy ole on the b-side is the most disorienting and bugged-out track in s small discography dank industrial rhythms set the tone but quickly disappear as they are dragged off grid by a waspy bassline more percussion surfaces steadying things but the track still feels like its leaning to one side the psychedelic closer air seems made for those late-night moments when a crowd feels they can reach out and touch the rhythms coming from the speakers

following sex fortress s left-turn into a chilly ebm-referencing sound s latest release for his label is more familiar lead track is a collaboration with frances which makes it difficult to tell where everyones input begins and ends its simple blend of liquid bass haunted background fx and subtle ascending melody could easily be slos work alone but stands as an effective piece of dark techno nonetheless the solo title track underlines that point coming across like a more jittery version of its predecessor on the flip the sonar-bleep minimal of is surprisingly sparse that is until slo spreads another thick generous bass groove into the mix making the ep standout trades in a similar area but its soft edges and muffled spacey howls foster a more meditative feel than the 125 bpm might suggest
are next up on finnish label inkfish recordings with the featuring two remixes from label head honchos themselves inkfish first up is instinct (inkfish remix) a nice bubbly loop features early on until an interesting breakdown full of warm pads sets the track off in the right direction the driving baseline works with the abundance of melodies raging throughout the production making this a sure fire summer hit with the progressive crew mindkiller (original mix) is first up on the b-side and uses a nice quirky baseline and some simple synths all while maintaining a constant 4/4 beat flow following is instinct (inkfish breaks mix) and it delivers a great example of melodic progressive breaks delicate beats ride along while floating melodies ring and intertwine with the swooshing atmospheric effects a pretty nice release here on inkfish with the inkfish remixes standing out in particular and as such making this release well worth a look
is anthoney j harts most prolific alias hes a uk musician who grew up in the 90s on a typical diet of raves and drum bass but the music he makes now is much darker and gnarlier as he paints a picture of a greyed-out world where dance music is listless rusted and drowned in noise one of harts best records is called shift work which is a clue towards what hes aiming for: he uses the repetition of dance music to mirror the grind of blue-collar life in his native uk his latest record what lands on the new label from rabit the a-side is given over to three tracks attacking broken beats with static and screech each of them offers a twist though the best is the title track which goes through the motions of a weary lockstep march towards nothing in particular those patterns are drunken and scrambled on the other two and their disorienting effect is amplified by a constant high-pitched whine its another device that feels mind-numbing like hart wants to wear you into submission the more substantial trades the screech for booming bass and breathing room hobbling along for seven minutes in a wretchedly staggered gait theres also a london version of it that comes out of leftfield some kind of ragga jungle-footwork hybrid with floating blobs of low-end and spastic kicks its an invigorating way to end an ep that can suck the life out of you in just 15 minutes brief and somewhat single-minded what might not be the most adventurous record but its one of the most intense

within narrow parameters it defined itself s drawing board was an impressive debut album disciplined and cohesive it contained devastatingly simple songs that in ir sparse fusion of chicago house and 80s synth-pop were perfect mechanical foil to kenny glasgows bereft vocals this was pop-house but pop-house that in i c u or without plumbed emotional depths it was music with soul all of which makes deeply confusing having minted ir sound you might expect canadian duo to elaborate on it stead y toss away ir most appealing quality contrast between cold emotionally-blank bleeps and kenny glasgows voice in ei r weak stylistic shifts ( watery piano house of ) or by using glasgows mantra-like vocals so sparingly that hes more a texture than a defining feature of tracks he appears on and its recall s mer glories but y lack irresistible hooks of ir predecessors elsewhere album is padded-out with banal collaborations (musically and lyrically and tracks are dismal) pointless interludes (street recordings of skateboarders a roadie requesting a bottle of jack daniels) and on that hoary old house music clich : an extended sample of a spoken-word lecture on consciousness strumental tracks like and flirt ineffectually with straight techno and tropical art-pop where ir first album felt like a definitive statement sounds as so many second albums do like a diffuse bunch of half-realised ideas whatever reason that may be need to go back to drawing board
the dominant thread in techno over the past few years has been the berghain sound but it finally seems as if the tides are shifting hell even the berghains own mix series and its most famous resident showcased moves towards a more melodic and varied sound earlier this year dutch label delsin and its immediate family including the deeper imprint has long been exploring the fruits of the crossover between pounding straight up 4/4 and the softer edges of dub techno with a bit of free for all experimentalism thrown in and is s first mix cd one that shows a fearless and rousing take on techno that feels refreshingly removed from the photonegative darkness that has held the genre in its clutches since berghain 02 calling your mix resisting routine might be a tad self aggrandizing but at least the inertia part is right: though s mix is composed mostly of dynamic breakbeats wading through a synthy mud puddle its remarkably stationary in feel apart from a few moments of lively excitement like s juddering or s centrepiece which all but stops the mix in its tracks with its tense moment of silence inertia is steady going s a savvy mixture of smart selection (every track is exclusive to released separately on a series of eps) and meticulous mixing so only the most excitable moments stand out in the careful blending like s house leaning or s savage the consistency lends inertia a monochrome sheen but its colour and personality is located all in those shifting skewed breakbeats a permanently staggered limp that turns anthemic in s hands hes a cogent choice to mix the compilation a techno renaissance man gaining praise for every techno style hes tried on in the past year and if nothing else proves his growing dj reputation is completely justified weaving exclusives into something legitimate on its own terms is not an easy task and while might indeed be a mix cd notable more for its tracklist than its mixing the possibilities for technos immediate future that it seems to point towards are exciting to say the least every producer provides dynamite with new to the scene names like and providing some of the discs best moments s a portrait of adventurous techno that strikes a near perfect balance between melody and propulsion between dance floor sensibilities and ear catching minutiae
christopher ramos debuted as last year on glacial industries which made its name as part the weightless grime movement weightless grime isnt the style fits into but ramoss sound palette glassy synths deep bass crisp drums shares similarities piano which is played with obvious classical training on and has a key role on the push-pull classical sounds and abstract electronics complementary and given equal weight provides much the eps movement and drama references the club but even the entirely electronic tracks are not dance floor numbers is the closest and it doesnt feel far from something kuedo might make an interlude has the chirpy sheen pc music but none the irony takes its name from the korean tradition musical storytelling performed by a vocalist and a drummer a nod to ramoss part-korean heritage thats a useful way to view to this release which is a narrative arc moods
is perhaps the most underrated of the crew of djs and producers working in and around erlins erghain club much of this is likely down to his slightly slower rate of production compared to his compatriots fengler releases are few and far between seemingly a once-a-year occurrence follows suit but is slightly unique in that its fenglers first for a label outside of ostgut that said its not far removed in place (luke slaters ) or sound (the ep fits neatly into his discography) unlike his recent r podcast there is little here that you wouldnt already expect from the techno lover oth and are pitched at a moderate pace but have a spring in their bounce that give them a crucial momentum is the livelier of the pair ut s plod is more intriguing as its cut through with a screech that soon becomes secondary to the militant stomp fenglers talent is in the way that he balances functionalism with distinctiveness theres always something going on in each track that should arouse interest but its never so fascinating that it gets in the way of the beat fengler has taken plenty of time tweaking these to perfection and you can hear it in every measure
s is capital m massive the type of track that should soundtrack the moment when the hands go up and the mouths go open it s a distillation of what s music has been about for the past few years and it almost demands he starts anew creatively quite simply it s what he does perfected what does is make melodic techno that through its devotion to the hook often reminds you of the dreaded t word (trance for those playing at home ) isn t trance surely but it sometimes make you feel the same way its synth line simply continues to go up and up and up almost unbearably so even while in actuality it s doing little more than repeating itself over and over again bout halfway through it s joined by long sweeping chords that shove the song into epic territory there are other elements: a wordless vocal that echoes beautifully a beat that marks time ably but without distinction a competing synth line that pushes the main theme to even greater heights ll of them save the last is inconsequential you sense that if you took everything else away you d be just as transfixed there s also a -side called and it s actually pretty good darker than the -side s typical undergirding chords roil rather than uplift the synth melodies are brooding instead of hopeful you could play it anytime in your set i suppose but that might require you flipping this thing over which i wholeheartedly oppose
club midi is a medium-sized nightclub in cluj-napoca romanias second biggest city the name will be unfamiliar to many but its arguably among the most important clubs in europe one in a small handful of key minimal house outposts dotted around the continent club midi has built up longstanding relationships with many of the styles main players from romanians connected to the [a:rpia:r] crew to foreign selectors like ricardo villalobos and zip the team also launched a label called last year debuting with a double-vinyl ep featuring cuts from mihigh rapu barac priku and sepp midi records returns with -klasse from bucharest newcomer 76 offering up two side-long minimal cuts -klasse carries the dubby stripped-back and hypnotic sound of midi records first ep both tracks put the attention on groove and atmospherics over rhythm so youll need a smooth mix and well-paced set to get the most out of them -side is the one to grab when the sun is out with a collage of bright samples creeping melody and a female vocal repeating whats that dream thanks to a heavier bassline and hushed subaquatic sound feels more suited to a dark sweaty room
while classic electronic styles are back in vogue few old school-influenced producers are plunging the same grainy depths that veteran s music inhabits the fact that flowers has 15 years of experience as a producer means that his sound has developed organically and doesnt sound like the new waves hurried attempt to recreate the past is raw and gritty its unpredictable construction and execution displaying an admirable disconnect with digitally-powered precision the title track and feature acid lines spurting and drizzling all over heavy gained drums and grimy shuffling percussion like phutures acid excesses cosying up to a somewhat restrained robert armani both tracks tease new life from chicago approaches flowers goes in a harder direction on the flip; is more stripped down with thunderous claps providing the backdrop for a buzz saw electronic bass that keeps on building are meanwhile sees him bring back his beloved 303 this time integrating menacing gurgles with crashing ominous cymbals and the kind of bleakly compelling rhythm track that beltram used to make in the early 90s maybe its time the new school took a leaf from flowerss well-thumbed dog-eared book
was originally released on well rounded back in truth be told its just as fine a track as it ever was with fluidly rolling drums and delirious vocal sample and a bassline just heavy enough to keep the whole thing from floating away on the wind ristol house notable julio ashmore gets two stabs at it for another go on well rounded one an earlier mix from and the other a more recent effort from last year and while both takes put a similar traditional house spin on the mournful stepper the difference between the two reveals just how fast uk music is moving these days for his first remix ashmore puts the song on pure cool cruise control lifting the tracks bassline section into a gliding ascent with s syncopated drums returning as luscious window dressing the remix easily slots alongside ashmores recent material like attle for middle you with its central bass riff dipping down into luxurious pools of sub-bass putting all the emphasis on predictable bass drops and a simpler arrangement that lacks the sublime build-up of the remix its hard not to see the earlier one as superior maybe its shocking that a track from can sound so current and even exciting perhaps a testament to ashmores budding talent even when he was still well a budding talent
the brand spanking new fina label on paper at least says that you can expect variety what they mean though is variety within the deep disco house realm inhabited by its founders: simon morrell from londons ddd parties matt long from leeds mono_cult parties and ralph lawson from 20:20 vision this ep from multiple pie-fingered helsinkian runs the gamut but has a foundation of chunk and quality heavy lumbering basslines are combined with rough stomping drums and theres a classic disco vibe that holds clout iry gospel choruses feature alongside a multitude of analogue synth lines pianos and even funk guitars what elevates it though is an easygoing weirdness: not overt but very present ts a mutation through aggressive compression and liberal washes of effects n for example the solo vocalists voice has spasmodic inflections and is surrealized by whipped cream delay the b sides are smoother and fuzzily tranquilizing but the effect is most pronounced on ts the -side and the peak time choice (the eps title and chartings show more popular affinity toward however) bunch of influences 70s funk 80s synths are whirled together and youre drawn into the vortex with no choice but to party like its 1979
its not hard to hear where dynamo dreesen and svn end and a made up sound begins on the trios new collaborative ep as dreesvn the first two have produced some of acidos best records through the years embodying the cult labels musical soul as well as anyone on the roster (dreesen real name andreas krumm founded the label in 2004 ) a made up sound the pseudonym of dave huismans is also an adventurous producer but with a style thats sleeker more bass-heavy and more directly in service of the dance floor depending on how you hear it is dreesvn tweaked for maximum impact or amus tinkered with by mad scientists either way they combine excellently you sense huismans taking the lead on the a-side a club cut engineered to set the floor to a boil it tick-tocks like a spindly dreesvn cut but the drums are sharper and more densely packed if previous records by the duo evoked the hissing between the trees depicted in their bucolic label art then the trio here sounds like theyre slicing through the underbrush on the b-side theyre more contemplative and improbably more intense oppressive pad-driven melodies dominate both tracks and the steady pulse found on the lead track cowers into arrhythmia adventurous djs will find a place for these nervy bursts just as many have with the dubby tightly wound house dreesvn sprinkled across their previous records the difference is with one of the hardest-hitting productions in acidos history on the a-side theyll have a sure bet on hand for backup
probably likes more music than you thankfully he cant help but want to share it s a dj thats a blessing and a curse with such wide tastes its been hard to pin the crosstown rebels label boss down to any one sound good for career longevity bad for pushing said career to the next level but its his almost uncanny r skills that have kept him relevant all these years its undoubtedly why he was selected by fabric for the latest mix in their long running series celebrating the sound of the london clubs saturday night line ups wandering ear makes for a fascinating tracklist shares space with uk funky maestro and yacht house specialists rub shoulders as well for the first portion of the mix it also holds together remarkably well somehow the sonic character of s busy house workout flows seamlessly into claude s laidback remix of s before slips in a shout out to the sound of the clubs past with s brilliant 2000 cut smooth and assured the cd warms up in the same way as craig richards fabric 01 its when cuts things off restarting the mix with s after the epic massive ttack sampling that the curse of his taste starts to creep in tracks themselves are great and at times phenomenal easy groove of s never sounded better s continues to prove that (for the clown nset duo) a little bit of eclecticism can go a long way is a brooding monster whose guitar ( ) solo sounds like a whale valiantly singing jazz through his speech impediment compared to the tightly mixed and quick moving first half though its less a showcase for and more a showcase for his taste track lengths balloon and s formerly cohesive feel dissolves into a sort of have you heard this one mixtape that ends with the raw disco of s and s curious avant pop given that its an 80 minute mix is more than welcome to share some of his off kilter favorites at the end but its indicative of how unveils itself to be three in one by its end for listeners its likely thatll be both blessing and curse
res been plenty of talk over the last few years about the resurgence of new york s clubbing scene rightfully so one could easily make the case that the after dark landscape particularly off the beaten path is as strong as its been in decades but that didnt happen spontaneously as if decreed from on high by the clubbing gods was years in the making with groundwork laid by a brigade of hard working party promoters label heads and s justin carter and eamon harkin who fit all three of those categories are some of the leaders in this new era duo have been throwing mister saturday night parties since 2009 with their much loved outdoor mister day parties running almost as long y run the mister saturday night label and theyve refined their ing to the point where theyre among new yorks most popular home grown spinners short carter and harkin are riding high what better time to release a mix cd is an 18 track mix recorded live at mister day this past summer s not quite as gleefully weird as some of their labels output theres nothing as eccentric as say lumigraphs yacht cruiser or the fluttering boil of archie pelagos frederyck swerl but the mix still has a lot of scope covering everything from gospel house to deep tribal techno former is represented by the tommy version of co s 1998 soul drenched classic changes ; the later comes in a great passage that layers parasoles quickstrike beneath elgatos gently bleepy zone as if to signal early on that this wont be a linear mix the set kicks off with a lilting 70s era chanson des followed immediately by the synth bass boogie of s youll also get maurice s piano fueled remix of s the smoky jazz of and j rgen s stomping carter and harkin save one of the most beautiful sequences for last bass clefs host a gorgeous hymn of a track drifts into s a song reminiscent of night moves era bob seger s an unexpected closer that shows the confidence these two have built over the years and its that confidence that makes this set such a pleasure

while european dance music has no trouble taking itself seriously its american equivalent has a proclivity for shits and giggles needless to say house and techno enjoy much less widespread popularity over here and when it comes to making hipsters and rock kids dance irony is almost as important as booze trendy acts like spank rock girl talk and lcd soundsystem are more then willing to goof around and sometimes house and techno artists like to join in on the fun the dirty bird crew tend to be a bit wackier than their european counterparts (as the martin brothers recent rocket surgery ep demonstrates) and lets not forget jay haze who couldnt resist the locker room appeal of a little porn routine known as ass to mouth s space chronic ep is another case in point by adorning the cover with dank nugz and creating a hook out of the line i want to have sex with bass this dallas based producer has fallen into step with his compatriots and quite lamely so much like choose your system the a-side from s last release is a half decent tech-house ditty spoiled by a pathetic vocal line the bass kicks hard the textures are polished and a handful of short breaks keep things fresh from start to finish but it would take far more dazzling production to salvage this track its impossible not to think of mark houle when you hear those vocals pitched down so low and the lyrics are asinine beyond the point of redemption things improve slightly with the same thick drums and glistening trim from stick around for this one and jive nicely with a mean acid synth line it could keep a party moving but certainly wont arouse any train-spotting on the b-side is a run-of-the-mill dj tool that struggles to draw attention to itself despite its smooth and heavy beat on each of the three tracks s ear for production shows but on this ep his blend of rambunctious party vibes and minimal sound textures ends up tasting like ice cream on pizza

the jazz-dance hybrid has a fair few precedents in recent times many of them displaying only a detached interest in the floor comparisons might be drawn between new york trio and portico quartet side project circle traps but where the latter group joins the dots between ecm-indebted jazz and forlorn post-dubstep s influences are a little fruitier their productions more danceable and often brimming with imaginative touches the trios second 12-inch for rightons well rounded individuals seems to cement their recent shift towards a more straightforward house template an effective vehicle it turns out for increasingly boundary-pushing experiments with harmony and structure is dreamy at the opening daubs of woodwind and cello occasionally swerving in over a galloping house beat; the tightly interwoven melodies recall norwegian outfit jaga jazzist efore long though were into the kind of slippery unstable breakdown the trio deployed on rown oxford : clusters of cello notes slide queasily around climbing to a shrill peak thats captured and looped as the beat returns such an unexpected foregrounding of the electronic is a risky manoeuvre but here its executed with ease is slower its delicate shuffle hosting smoky layers of rhodes and flute spindly chord progression introduced partway in gives the whole thing a sort of fusion vibe ut dont let that description alarm you: if anyone can pull it off its these guys

close your eyes while watching an old tom and jerry cartoon and all the crashes bangs and wallops could be the most avant-garde music stockhausen never dreamt up similarly close your eyes while listening to some of s records and all the thumps and drones seem to project the bright explosions of hanna and barberas imaginations onto the back of your eyelids copeland is a member of black dice a group whose malformed grooves have long skirted the fringes of the dance floor; the manically-sliced rhythms on copelands own solo efforts like 2012s limbo had him edging ever closer manically-sliced rhythms on copelands own solo efforts like 2012s limbo had him edging ever closer sees him taking a running jump right into the middle but like a cartoon character crashing through a wall copeland leaves his own unmistakeable imprint throughout rhythms might be recognisably house or hip-hop but copeland pulls and squeezes their structures like accordions rozki s backpedalling techno beat turns into what sounds like a wild hoedown meanwhile stumbles drunkenly along on a slurred and greasy bassline before throwing a fit of manic breakbeats reminiscent of wagon christ se early tracks all feel like about 20 different tunes bound together with elastic bands and the production is fittingly replete with rubbery clicks and snaps after that though almost seems to fall apart opening tracks are all longer than four minutes but most of the rest are bitesize chunks is basically just a filtered house loop that feels like its been cut out the middle of another record and a are half-formed filler the great pop art tradition of his hometown copeland is an accomplished collage artist adept at combining the highbrow and the trashy but when the individual bits are laid out on their own they can seem a bit throwaway
six years after the first l i e s record american producers continue to explore lo-fi house and techno is a young outpost for such explorations and their latest signing is an enthusiastic pathfinder the new york-based producer brian pi eyro makes foggy techno as dj wey and deep reggaeton as dj python his latest alias offers something different again and it might be his most exciting project yet the text accompanying hints at the mood everythings blue in this world ) the style is jungle of a sort spaced out and slowed down to a hollow dirge these are more static mood pieces than dynamic dance tracks but the moods are captivating the track titles offer further clues as to pi eyros mindstate: and ] suggest meditations on nothingness each tracks breakbeat syncopations are layered black secret technology -style though the tone isnt soulful but bleak thanks to the gloomy pads roaming their surface elsewhere the producer seems to long for intimacy theres an ember of wistful warmth in the smouldering whose breakbeats outline a calmer halftime thud on someones boomy percussion calls to mind the blissful rave inversions of shed or ilian tape like several of these tracks it rolls along for a couple of minutes longer than necessary the repetition fits the grim mood but the records best moment is the more concise which holds bleak and redemptive sounds in perfect balance
even though he s been signed to the label since 2000 has never played on -team it s probably for lack of a proper artist album: while high contrast put out his third full-length last year and nu:tone his second yrd only put out a staid compilation of past eps ( medical history ) and a lone original under the sea his limited output might be for the best however past tracks like dog hill and soul function are fluorescent-bright sonically dense drum n bass workouts which makes them best experienced in small infrequent doses his latest is in the same basic mold: a megaton of bass shot through with a thoroughly old-school jungle riddim slathered with a rainbow of samples ranging from nostalgic rap to barking dogs and all made sense of with yrd s token theme of soulful house vocals simply put it s a massive track while under the sea tried a little too hard to be the drinks-down hands-up anthem of the night manages to do all that without being too self-conscious or overbearing it also doesn t hurt that yrd dusted off his old kai s5000 sampler to make it happen making the cut stand out in stark relief to some of the more (pardon the pun) clinical sounds that have been coming out of hospital lately instead of being a dumping ground for full-length misfits or 3 m noodlings yrd s -sides are consistently home to tracks that are just as good or better than their other halves here he retains his taste for fast and furious sound collages from with a near trance-level slice of cheese melted over film samples space shuttle radio transmissions and a computer fembot voice this grocery list of dance music production 101 staples would sound stale in lesser men s hands but yrd s technical prowess makes labyrinth another diamond
top of innumerable single and ep releases released the observer in 2007 an ambitiously overstuffed package of everything ranging from fussy minimal to throbbing techno to emotional orchestral overtures and meandering interludes while it had a few flaws it proved mull an adventurous and restless producer creating what was for better or worse an albums album in contrast released on drumcode sister label is a dance floor album through-and-through e of those albums loaded with long extended jams that would normally seem like a chore to sit through what lacks in techno-renaissance-man wares however is made up for in an unwavering intensity barring its opening and closing tracks is a barrage of tightly coiled minimal techno blessed with a ropy and malleable low end that bestows a persuasive and seductive body that so much minimal sorely lacks rather than venture too far outside of his comfort zone mull instead dots his tracks with vivid hi-definition details that dip in and out of the surging liquid grooves the album feels like its constantly shooting forward at maximum power samples caught up in and twisted by the current the forced-apart vocals of or the elastically snapping chords in are prime examples elements that sound like they can barely keep up with their surroundings thriving on moments of clipped catharsis the thrill comes with those tiny samples pulled to their breaking point hits strongest in the middle with a full-throated peaktime anthem wringing a muted chord motif through its relentless and choppy froth all thud and physical impact like most of the album its almost transparent occupying as little space as possible and turning minimal from an ill-fated trend into an ideology for all of this its a surprisingly breezy and quick listen even at 76 minutes maybe mull has discovered the secret to subduing an audience lies in hitting them over the head as hard as possible that being said in its closing stretch does indulge in some introspection: where is mostly generic synth drone and jazzy electric piano tones the title track closes the album in a naggingly uncertain wash of whooshes plucked strings creating an uncomfortable contrast with the amorphous backdrop with each tug theyre nice reminders that can make music that isnt concerned solely with fist-pumping functionalism but the detail-oriented and constantly shifting tracks that dominate are proof enough in the first place
its nice to hear 90s warp on a release even if it comes from another label and artist entirely thats not to say that should be fobbed off as merely an imitation album instead its one harvested from a similarly introverted and playful approach to production is a collection of experiments from brighton-hailing and first lp-proper from the now berlin-based sam barker while pairing up with berghains andreas baumecker has harnessed barkers musical roving into a more 4/4 albeit abstracted techno frame his work has no such constraints on the whole follows a far more ambient route than its predecessor disillusion desire consumption released in 2006 free by net lab and me example traverse ethereal planes with and barely nudged through chimey atmospheric hues is the brashest track off the album and only real nod to s wrong music and breakcore affinities alluding to the camps more tongue-in-cheek factions with its plinky plonky gaming intro it is still fairly tame in comparison elsewhere superbly delivers that potent blend of abrasive techno programming with twinkling melodies that made and makes idm so damn compulsive it nails down the warp / rephlex mula of being uplifting in an eyes-down sort of way not quite danceable and yet seriously catchy re are jungle touches here too in a lolloping slo-mo squarepusher fashion on 1 3 and only mild problem with all of this to use barkers own metaphor of genres as languages is that comes across a little tongue-tied and wears the mask of a concept album without actually delivering one however at base value experiments displays thoughtful sound design and sensitive craftsmanship throughout use of hardware equipment including old synths distortion pedals and even a remin wraps in a hazy analogue glow and seems to pacify even the most pummelling tracks fact that it spans a decade of production with a track even dredged up from barkers school days isnt immediately detectable though perhaps goes a way to explain its inconsistency if this is indeed sam barker finding his voice i look ward to hearing what he says next

heads up: ends in a locked groove i cant say how long i spent in the thick of its machine zaps and pitter-patter percussion before realizing this id sunk as deep into the zone as i had in a long time but i had to chuckle at the trick s sleight of hand doesnt just demarcate a near-perfect techno loop it also pokes fun at the seriousness of the pursuit you could literally dance to it forever and thats at once blissful ridiculous and unnerving do you e er sit and wonder what youre really doing reads the final line of the manifesto accompanying the first release from the berlin- and ancouver-rooted three-piece and their label (their mission statement is to provide listeners with an opportunity to locate and maintain a state of total and complete mental/spatial reassurance ) the record is indeed a deconstruction of dance musics conventions crutches and pleasures but its a hell of a lot more fun than that sounds is the smartest record of the year so far and sure to be one of its most distinct pleasures is a dead zone lows boom and highs squeak but the frequencies between have been all but scooped out so when brittle pads and a breakbeat fill the void they amount to an epiphany the producers do this across the a-side teasing out barely-there tunes that could have been ripped from a damaged cassette though the music will sound fucked up on any system the flaws draw us further into unconventional riches: the lysergic shimmer of bit-crushed percussion the wails that could either be a theremin or poorly sampled bird chirps once youve alighted from you get an ambient reprieve though never scramble toward a conclusion 2 0 is the only track that really takes its time oscillators gurgle and burst but the track is mostly a smooth rise prototypically dance tunes build up break down and repeat if i hadnt heard it might not have occurred to me that an alternative could feel so refreshing

its unlikely simone white and kassem mosse ever would have appeared on the same record if not for honest jons white is an american singer-songwriter whos released a string of ghostly pop albums on the london label; kassem mosse is gunnar wendel a techno artist whose dusty productions on workshop and other labels have made him a cult favorite on wendel gently reworks three tracks from whites 2012 album silver silver is the only track here with a classic kassem mosse flavor or more specifically one of his signature 110 bpm chugs which nicely offsets whites melty chords and daydreamy vocals (this one you may remember appeared early on in lowtecs excellent ra podcast from last year) nearly everything seems to be drawn from the original whose room-sounds and angular rhythm perfectly suit wendels style other two reworks have a lighter touch is a sparse and mysterious ballad to begin with wendel just stretches it out loses the guitar and leans more heavily on the scattered percussion on he actually changes quite a bit dropping the vocals adding a halting backbeat and a thick bass guitar but the sounds are so in line with whites palette that the track feels more like an alternate take than a remix all three show a subtler side of wendel than weve ever heard before
the roland -50 is a colder harsher sounding rack mount version of the alpha juno synthesiser which was famous for bringing the hoover sound to dance music in spite of its title s latest record for isnt exactly a mentasm workout though youll find its deranged fingerprints on the and nor is it the type of straightforward and dependable electro record weve come to expect from the dutch label but it does include some solid dj tracks; almost without fail people have requested ids for -50 tracks every time ive put it on the four-tracker centres on s classic electro sound design but some 4/4 kicks and simple hi-hat patterns make it potentially appealing to a larger audience the has the best bassline ive heard in recent years: its slippery and staccato at the same time and sounds like its diving forward with every repetition it starts to break into strange squelches like the -50 took a bite out of its own circuitry but the simple drums keep things light and brisk the features a wandering synth that absentmindedly picks notes from a chromatic scale like curios in a gift shop while the is the most syncopated and gritty offering here given their quirks those two tracks are the most demanding of the lot but that doesnt make them any less engaging the has an almost minimal-esque tautness to the drum production though any sign of classy restraint is quashed when an opening filter reveals the fat sinister hoover bassline there are pleasingly queasy details zapping all around -50 tracks if they freak out less adventurous selectors even the most straight-laced djs could get behind the
if youve seen detroits favourite sex fiend play out in the last year youll know hes been through a metamorphosis where his older music was more funk than anything else slow sensual and full of twisty vocal melodies hes now on a house and techno attack maybe its living in erlin or maybe hes exploring his motor city roots either way its no coincidence that he called a track strike and his second release for his label brings out the big guns the vast collection of hardware edgar uses remains the same so sounds like last years majenta flattened with a hammer a single chord splinters like copper wire over the militant drum beat a simple but futuristic sound has some of the old edgar charm this time the chords are beveled to a pearlescent shine theres the barest hint of vocals and the track slips into a slinky breakdown halfway through that recalls the seductive xxx days wraps things up with the most bash-you-over-the-head thing edgar has ever done you can imagine him stomping along with every kick drum which hits hard but retains all the dynamism of his best work and while edgars new direction might not be as engaging to the electro heads he at least pulls it off
by aka johnny phethean takes pleasure in isolation or the act of heading towards it there are track titles like and which suggest space travel this may be deliberate since the tracks were according to the label made using astronomical data the music a hiss-crusted mix of organic and electronic effects studded onto glassy tones mostly drifts from one ambient landscape to another only the tired claps on one of two drum tracks on the cassette and s indistinct dialogue suggest a human presence but not much of seems despondent as remoteness is rendered with an affecting warmth theres one other voice on a loop of a single phrase again indistinct on that repeats like faulty playback as celestial tones gently rise and exhale the words themselves sink and resurface as though slipping in and out of focus from here the music gets increasingly drowsy s drums and bells trudge through banks of static on which exposes the spectral thrum of sounds crackle and glow like fading embers the title tracks slender organ tones hum in a soothing emptiness an inner peace found in outer space
house has got to be one of the most contentious genre labels ever devised within dance music what deepness is varies from person to person and from year to year but what never changes is the fervour with which true believers will defend their own definition against what they see as the barbarian hordes clamouring at the gates s also got to be one of the snobbiest labels ever devised calling your own music deep is tantamount to calling everyone else s music shallow and unlike say hardness or minimalism the opposite of deep has little value but deep is currently in vogue (see nth to nth and any of a number of recent interviews for details) therefore it is clearly time for some sort of m w retrospective seeing as they were considered pretty much the definitive deep house act of the 90s this compilation is under the guise of but in fact comes from the ever commercially savvy defected records who are reviving the veteran label what today s clubbers may not know is that this 90s version of deep was a very different beast from todays model with its warm fluffy cocooning sounds and spacy vocals back in the day it often meant hard crunching beats wailing divas and an emphasis on live sounds or jazz samples lot of this was due to deep house defining itself against and opposite to rave and techno music house was in theory house with roots house that recognized that it came from disco and that supposedly eschewed drugs and european techno hedonism for a more urban controlled and sexual experience t its height this rhetoric often seemed to be harking back to a mythical era of music where a rainbow hued mix of people danced to soulful vocals and natural sounds s disc is very much on this tip conjuring up the archetypal image of a deep house club as we imagined it back then small sweaty and sexually charged however what this disc also aptly illustrates is that despite deep being discussed as if it were a philosophical and mystical quality most of the time producers tended to treat it as a stylistic exercise so if your record had the same sounds and tropes as the other deep records well then it must be deep too result of this is that tracks like which and many other garage nerds gushed over in the 90s sound pretty corny today back then we noticed that it had a bumpy jersey rhythm and a diva with the right credentials with the perspective of time what mostly notice now is how awful the song is and how clich d the delivery that s not to say that s disc doesn t deliver some of the time s nside is as enervating as ever and danell dixon s is still weirdly appealing with its plonking melody n general the beats here are as raw and biting as ever which is great but unfortunately the mix is so stuffed with theatrical vocals that it feels a bit like being dogpiled all forty members of sounds of ness this is interesting though because it illustrates how notions of what a deep or authentic vocal is have shifted n the 90s cheesy vocals were defined the shrillness of pop trance and happy hardcore whereas deep vocals sounded like retha franklin se days as the black merican influence has faded from house authenticity is more about restraint and positively indie ish vocals such as on dark soldier or voguish feist remixes overall little s disc is more successful as a mix probably due to his more cerebral and euphoric take on deepness which is far more in line with the way the genre is now seen starts gloriously with s bewitching and vocal used over rmand van helden s witchdoktor with the former s yearning dreaminess perfectly complementing the tribal stomp of the latter mix continues in much the same vein with eye closing moments aplenty balanced with more jacking touches like the apocalyptic kick drums in other stand outs are the immortal mix) a tune that anyone interested in the current crossover territory between house and techno needs to hear and the s which still sounds utterly contemporary and would fit right into a sebo k set re are of course other moments that are not so successful due to the tracks having aged rather less well m not implying anything honest but a lot of these moments involve two of the most excruciating were the lame rasta samples on the appallingly named buddha mix) and the final track it which is a corny and cheap exploitation of jazz signifiers despite all the iconic tracks it includes wouldn t rate terribly highly as a listening experience particularly as the mix can be quite hard on the ears however as a document and an exercise in nostalgia it is invaluable m w were not the untouchable gods they occasionally seemed to be at the time nor were they the lame purveyors of limp jazz house that some modern critics accuse them of being like all artists they suffered from the problems of their day but they also managed to frequently transcend them and that is what really counts
londons mr beatnick a dj and producer with roots in hip-hop and nu-jazz returns to the deep house and boogie he initiated with last years synthetes ep also on semteks dont be afraid imprint new material is definitely of a piece with the last record (minus the pronounced metro area influence that marked the title track) favoring soft rounded synth melodies and elegant drum programming whether or not its an analog affair it certainly sounds like it all four tracks are models of the kind of cohesion you get when working with just a handful of machines: its a remarkably balanced record with every sound nestling neatly into place a laidback deep house cut in the vein of nebraskas a weekend on my own ep makes for an obvious opener thanks to a muted bass line lush rhodes chords and delicate synth ornamentation coming across as fuzzy (and as juicy) as a peach the and feature slightly tougher funk but they remain bathed in a rosy glow; they sound a little like a dreamier take on recloose (or a slightly less jazzy floating points) with beatnick expands his musical horizons to include a kind of quixotic italo disco exploding with color and odd harmonies all in all the record sounds as versatile as it is stylistically diverse: while its most closely connected to the subtly shaded slightly throwback house coming from labels like rush hour (or for that matter 100 silk) you could imagine it going over equally as well with hot natured fans given the musics bumpy funk underpinnings too modest to call crowd-pleasing its still amicable as hell
maybe you havent heard of in his native italy though hes well known for throwing parties as well as his dj sets at places like jesolo near venice where he held a residence for eight years considering all of this nocturnal mischief especially in the balmy driatic it makes sense that he would produce such latin-inflected and squarely danceable music but hes been learning as well as partying and these three distinct edits of and with fellow italian (not their first collaboration) are solid and classy muted hazy trumpet repeats over the original of cyclically building and building over a loose chattering mix of light and wooden rhythmic sounds it drops out and holds for a good minute and then thumps back in with both gusto and a joyful fanfare which seems to herald a night of debauchery reminds of shades of jae by moodymann the dancey bits that is with a little piano motif tinkling playfully about and the continual dropping in and out of the upfront pushy and acoustic drumbeat the swing version of means hes really going swing as in prohibition-era jazz swing its translated into 21st century dance with a boompty kick and the fact that its built around loops mr scruff would be proud and rightly so weird little voice repeats the word bock at the beginning of each eight-beat pattern on the re-edit a nice touch which gives it tons of groove in fact its probably the grooviest on here (sorry vinyl shoppers) and illustrates the fact that although nothing massively life-changing this ep succeeds in what it sets out to do which is producing laidback but thumping party music by combining a jazzy purist edge with loads of motion
k producers murlo and deadboy launched their new label productions with a collaborative two-tracker the former is known for cheeky bashment edits and grime-laced club tracks; the latter hit it big with his 2010 anthem if want me a slanted take on 2-step and funky deadboy has since found a home at local ction where hes released more relaxed synth-heavy jams the pairs first joint record features two distinctly british party tracks that unite their influences with style and a wicked sense of fun is the deadliest of the two a bubbly spin on bassline house and classic grime there are currently countless producers looking to grime for inspiration but where many of them drag the sound into the avant-garde de-constructing it into oblivion deadboy and murlo leave it largely intact you can hear both producers digging into their wheelhouses for : the pitched-up dancehall chat and hyperactive midi flute is classic murlo while the sparkling synth textures evoke deadboys touch its an earworm with a weird edge and its sure to get rinsed wherever these shades of k bass are welcome goes for something similar the melodic interplay is the best part with a number of big synth lines dashing up and down the scale at once it would be just as lethal as if not for the mildly oppressive pitched-up vocals their presence is so high in the mix that when they lift for a few seconds its a moment of respite but is still a charming track that gives dancers plenty to grab onto both cuts are a reminder to not be scared of bright and bold melodies a lesson in how to use color effectively
new zealand producer fis is shall we say unusual nominally a drum bass producer one listen to his deformed concoctions is likely to leave you hiding under your bed or at least scratching your head after a few scattered tracks olly perryman steps up for an official solo debut on samurai musics horo imprint is probably the closest thing here to conventional: with its scurrying drums and grumbly vocal sample its bizarro-world ragga jungle a la rockwell but worry not things get weirder slows things down as bass rumbles collect into fizzy lines that sound like paper tearing remember joes ubiquitous claptrap on hessle audio is kind of like that only set on fire and writhing in agony that feeling of all-consuming apocalypse is realized on what might be the definitive fis track thus far the title gives a hint of what to expect over limping drums that cant possibly be in time perryman lets loose a barrage of wheezing synths doubled with firecracker sound effects just for the hell of it one listen to something like is like watching a car crash: its so horrifically fascinating you cant divert your attention even better it sounds like a car crash
ive artists ten sides of tape ive and a half hours of music where do you start with a release like this iagonal rave tapes is a comprehensive document of a nights raving in two of orsica studios back in may label boss is on the bill as is his recent collaborator theyre joined by vol and oe ndrews of opens with a hybrid live/ set ts a typically aggressive performance showcasing solo work and forthcoming material from onsumer lectronics his trio with philip est and sarah roelich one particular vocal sample saws its way through the latter half of the set distilling ests trademark venom down to a split second of terrifying potency the recording comes entirely from room mics and while there are moments youd love to hear with a bit more definition the sound bouncing off the walls and the audience chatter does give the whole thing a very strange slightly removed atmosphere t feels raw and you cant forget youre listening to a one off performance ndrews follows with an hour of garage grime and hardcore ts fun but not quite coherent and things dont really begin to click again until the second half of s set when he starts pulling acid and m out of the bag y now its heading for 3 m and the crowd are making themselves heard the whole place sounds full of energy s mixing is smoother on the second side building momentum much more effectively than the playful train wrecking of the opening half hour latches onto this momentum and takes it to the logical conclusion: flat out pounding techno eginning with lesh nd lood the side from his erceuse eroique p its full throttle from the beginning dark brutal and bloody effective the madness peaks about halfway through the second side then disintegrates into noise before some lighter talo flecked tunes finish things off vol pushes the tempo again jumping to 150 pm and rising from there ts a frantic set for the heads still standing with a proper classic rave feel the end of the tape comes before the energy drops ts a set that sums up the iagonal appeal: fun but also dark complex and surprising building on the sounds of the past hardcore m unker friendly techno but not quite defined by them s a collection iagonal rave tapes is a nice thing to have but its expensive and whats more its sold out whole night of raving isnt the easiest thing to listen to at home or at least not in one sitting that said fewer people have this tape than were at the night and they paid more for it in other words the recording is literally valued higher than the experience itself which is slightly discomfiting ts a fun release but whether a limited edition collectors item is the right way to honour a night of raw and unpretentious dance music well youll have to be the judge of that

djs look to for tracks of a certain tone over the past five years the new jersey artist has expanded his signature sound by going slower faster weirder and deeper but at its core andersons music always retains a sense of sinister poise even when hes doing tender deep house as he does on the title cut from this ep for he cant help but sound bittersweet make no mistake: is gorgeous synths and piano lines are typically rich his use of drums sounds characteristically refined but the jan jelinek-style buzzes and the gently discordant backing synth are grey clouds on an otherwise clear day is textbook anderson a track to replace another of his similarly-crafted cuts in your record bag its central synth arpeggio is a near-constant its brand of edgy drama immediately identifiable reason anderson can sustain these unflinching grooves is revealed here in the final 20 seconds: the bass and drums and in particular the toms provide powerful low-end momentum allowing him to run wild in the mids and highs ditto kick and bass are both tough customers but up top we get cosmic organs and glossy fm synths its a classic example of anderson-style counterpoint
n music whenever two people collaborate theres always talk about how open and organic the process was occasionally the stars align and two musicians in this case australian folk singer ry and mes frank wiedemann come together in such a complementary way that it does indeed seem like the most natural thing in the world as makes abundantly clear was meant to be n retrospect you can see why these two are simpatico ts easy to imagine ry s tremulous voice soaring above an me track and wiedemanns crew nnervisions has always absorbed indie-rock influences into its sound but none of that guaranteed that would forge such a deep intuitive understanding itself the track that first propelled this project into the spotlight was in many ways a misleading start essentially a wiedemann edit of an existing ry song to which he added a bassline and a beat its tentative and predictable where their work since then has blossomed into something far more integrated that said the restraint and self-discipline that wiedemann showed on is instructive where an album like this could easily become a bloated clash of egos and ideas is both musically uncluttered and seemingly unforced ts tracks appear to follow their natural paths be that onto the dance floor or into small hours ballad territory at one end of the spectrum you have the gorgeous ts bruised wistful tone recalls cut copy or moderat but constructed from just a throbbing bass guitar an earworm synth line and crisply-dispatched beats its a track of unusual poise and simplicity n contrast the eight-minute evolves irresistibly from its initial buddhist temple atmosphere bells running water rustling percussion into a big room banger which ry leads with a fittingly incantatory vocal like its an utterly convincing fusion of rock vocals and dance floor dynamics does fall below that level briefly is a wet lachrymose lapse but that is more than outweighed by say zurich or which unexpectedly channel the cocteau twins to produce music of a rarefied star-bright beauty n an indie-dance lineage traceable from scritti politti to lcd soundsystem to james blake this is highly sophisticated pop music that fuses its influences with a dazzling dexterity
s resurgence over the past few years after more than a decade of inactivity has been a welcome development for minimal and dub techno connoisseurs following a run of crucial reissues (and the launch of a promising offshoot strobelight network) the icelandic techno label finally delivers some new material with the first solo release from core artist in 13 years the ep features four lean dubbed-out productions that make for an excellent continuation of s now-classic sound the title track establishes s nocturnal mood moving through a couple wide-open drops at 122 bpm as reverberating chords pass overhead like a thunderstorm and threnning are a little faster and more urgent with hi-hats slicing into the space between the beats is about as hard-edged as this record gets thanks to the fiery crackle in its chords while threnning is a moody heads-down boogie with ethereal vibes s penchant for uncanny atmospheric sound design is again on full display for : the eps ultra-deep highlight shivers and glimmers across the sparsest of drum grooves this potent dose of dub techno is sure to satisfy fans of both the artist and label
with his debut album seems determined to tick-off every techno clich monochromatic artwork check bleak one-word track titles check a credit for berlins dubplates and mastering but of course at first listen the music may seem equally formulaic has the compressed funk of a ben klock set hangs there throbbing sadly like one of the quiet moments on sheds the traveller is a rugged bustle of dulled kicks random squelches and rasping hi-hats that dettmann would put to explosive use you might reasonably ask is that it in terms of range on an hour-long album but if you play it loud and listen closely suckut will reel you in why because he is in masterful control of his sparse decaying material may be familiar but its also beautiful as is the lo-fi opener for its part is an extraordinary example of how you can create mournful desperation with little more than a commanding kick a groaning hook and an echoing knock far more surprising is the playfulness of certain tracks s main motif is what sounds like someone plucking in a sloppily funky way at a bass guitar atop almost gleeful digital whooping there is a similar giddiness to the rhythmic layering of whose stark sonar pulses and squeaking percussion turn cartwheels against one another true none of this exactly hangs together in a way that screams home listening and youve got to be in the mood for it that is open to the inexplicable excitement of a simple clap coming in at the right (/wrong) moment but as much as you may have seen and heard this all before suckut proves that there is still plenty of life left in hard techno
in football a short passing game describes a style of play where the ball tends to circulate in neat geometric patterns this happens to be the title of s latest record but its not an accurate metaphor for the label to which it belongs s music showcased in the recent compilation absolutely wino can seem unruly and full of tricks unpredictable tracks like stolen valour craudrock and tractor troubles (part ii) spoke more to the maverick spirit of a player like zlatan ibrahimovic than the regimented simplicity of teammates whose job is to fetch and keep the ball for all that combines skill and discipline with a practised ease operating within a narrowed fusion of krautrock and post-rock is faithful to s musical curiosity without straying too far from the bands from which the mini-album takes inspiration there are tints of neu and suicide but the closest analogue is maybe tortoise on the groups self-titled debut instrumental songs were woven with harmonica smears mumbled vocals repeating rhythms and electronic thumbprints all tied together with an introverted funk strapped to kehoes drum machine these same elements often travel at greater speeds less tortoise more hare if you will in the tight gaps of s racing drums twitchy bass guitars harmonica swipes wild yelps and sonar-like synths jostle with each other this frenzy also drives the guitar screeches of and whose dense electronic scree may owe something to the phone signal listed among the tracks instruments layers guitars over another pounding beat korg ms-20s and siel orchestra synths simmer under these tracks though the electronic elements are secondary to the albums organic textures when it slows to a jog finds a more affecting rhythm s drum machine snares rattle as though played by a human hand sustained organs and bass guitar notes idle in the songs fabric in the same way teenagers might sit on beanbags to roll joints the title of suggests disaster (the track is named after a storm that passed over the uk and ireland in december 2015) what emerges instead is the pastoral melancholy of the durutti column served with a sly nod as the clarinet begins to spiral around s warm harmonica a breeze whistles like a faint echo of chaos
its certainly not 2008 anymore but skull disco vet doesnt seem terribly concerned where so many ristolians (and dubstep producers in general) have fled from 140 pm w scott cree has continued to explore the shifty rhythms and shawdowy sounds that have long defined dubstep his latest for longtime collaborator ppleblims label brings plenty of original sounds to the table but pips followers and continuum seekers may find themselves checking their calendars not that this 17th 12-inch slides in through a timewarp: from the moment the scratchy drums on hit our speakers were treated to something that feels tremendously urgent sour organs glide in voices scream from afar and bass rumbles just south of everything it may not sound as breathtaking as when martyn was caught in this orbit some years back but everythings right where it should be somewhat less predictable steps harder and lays into the low-end more forcefully sending dub zaps speeding off into the atmosphere for a thrilling second half y the time your needle hits the runout youll wish more producers had stuck with this sound and cherish those sides that keep the floor just the right amount of wobbly
its a good time to be an fan the well-regarded icelandic techno artist recently announced reissues of two rare records from his back catalog the first is -box one of his early eps for the cult label now more than 15 years old it stands as arguably the quintessential release: its wonderfully warm and dubby and a joy to mix with thanks to its crisp efficiently constructed percussion part of its staying power comes from its versatility with four tracks of varying tempos (moving from 135 down to 120 bpm) and moods that are all primed for deeper sessions i a brisk lightly swung 135-bpm cut with bright piano stabs begins things on an uplifting note a ttfalt its jungly percussive tones paired with subtly filtered cymbals is the records off-kilter gem and counts among s very best efforts the slower-burning b-side returns to more familiar dub techno sounds skra argat adds a touch of darkness and urgency with its echoed chords and low synth murmurs and stretches across more than ten minutes last track spaellt is starlit and spliff-ready unfurling wispy tendrils of melody into cosmic ether as it brings to a close this classic ep
is a label for the weird kids lorded over by a big weird kid firm dedication to the new and unusual has prevented mike paradinass 20 year old label from earning ninja tune or warps elder statesmen status though its also kept its discography fresh and unpredictable ts wide range of outr sounds and its unstoppable release schedule can make it easy to gloss over the contributions that has made to electronic music n addition to issuing early dm classics the uk institution has helped define breakcore bring dubstep to an outside audience and perhaps most notably introduce the world to footwork nd the platform mu has given oddballs like and the lost jungle classics it has reissued and its single handed relaunch of grime vet terror s career shouldnt be understated for its 20th anniversary still run out of paradinass home in brighton has attempted the difficult task of taking stock of two decades within two cds n typically forward thinking fashion 20 does so not by rifling through past achievements but by digging into the archives and offering up unheard and sometimes new material from some of its most respected artists unreleased songs date as far back as 2003 meaning that we get exclusive tracks from the likes of vexd and t creates a more well rounded picture of the label than a compilation of contemporary tunes could have some of the best cuts are uncovered from the past like the humid tropicalia of s glossy roller and terror s vintage remix of for example thread of woozy hypnagogia that has characterized mus past five years is represented too from s synth pop to s synth wave while recent contributions from mr and offer dark ambient perspectives ll of which sits next to forlorn techno from old school footwork from and the thunderous death knell of nkou (perhaps the collections standout if picking just one was possible) tracklist drives home the sheer diversity of the labels output granted that variety makes 20 a slightly disjointed listen but no true representation of could ever be smooth or uniform the label rejects those qualities in principle originality is what binds the discography together not aesthetics paradinas prefers artists with strong signature voices and 20 shows off their most characteristic tracks s is apocalyptically funky; ssassins sounds like a blockbuster films opening sequence; extreme cathartic rivals anything weve heard lately from the winnipeg outsider dubplate mix of s 995 jungle classic is so unhinged that it practically one ups breakcore years before it was invented contributions from and represent a crucial but oft forgotten facet of : heavy as shit occasionally humorous drum break rinse outs you wont find artists like mat or producer on the two core discs of 20 which is fine theres barely enough room to contain a few years of nevermind 20 but those who shell out for the deluxe edition are treated to a third helping of oddities largely for the diehards you get abstraction from the likes of ynx and as well as a few revelations ( s does not sound like it came from the early 2000s) collectors edition of 20 also comes with a lovingly written book from rory gibb that outlines the labels history connecting the dots between the more extreme ends of its discography and offering a glimpse into paradinass mind music on 20 is equally a view into that mind and its peculiar tastes though he rarely gets the level of recognition and respect as his good friend and one time collaborator phex twin paradinas is a visionary an incredibly talented producer and a savvy curator his label is in essence one big vanity project: an erratic imprint that releases what paradinas likes regardless of how trendy it might look or how successful it may or may not be ( n the book its also revealed that operating is still a financially precarious situation likely because of his mercurial interests ) 20 is almost like paradinass own alternate history of contemporary electronic music where vexd outshined tal mystikz was one of the most influential jungle producers and was the next burial with footwork however its an irreplaceable historic resource footwork initially attracted paradinas because of its raw energy and inscrutably fast rhythmic patterns like a midwestern mutation of the breakcore jungle and rave music thats inspired him since the beginning and its become the labels greatest legacy in recent years n typical fashion paradinas gravitates to the rougher ends of the genre resulting in recent releases from and instead of the more polished work of spinn but we probably wouldnt have those bigger more popular footwork producers if it werent for paradinass support and exposure in the first place over the years has been the springboard for all kinds of artists the recluses and icons working on electronic musics next step ts the thing about these weird kids: they only seem weird because theyre miles ahead of everyone else
fter lurking in the warp records slipstream tackling a retrospective mix for the label and contributing tracks for 2600 recordings and remixes for his new label under the zill alias dylan richards has since released guttural shots of breakstep ruffage on combat recordings as its in this shadowy vein that his debut single for south londons continues with rigami spewing amplified dancehall rhythms on top of that drum bass-style dagger bass that scythes into your kidneys when its played at high volumes of and lood is the easier listen of the two tracks on offer but its still a dark and twisted number that uses unsettling crouching tiger hidden dragon -esque vocal drones as a melodic breakdown before it sears back into a rhythmic lesson in how to reverb your snares so they crush skulls like coke cans the digital squiggle melody is the punisher though and drives the track throughout its five minutes after it makes its appearance at the second drop there really is no pussyfooting about it: is a speaker-testing producer y his own admission hes murdered countless tweeters throughout his recent song writing processes unleashing this 12-inch as his debut for is a very bold and likeable state of intent ring on the pain
if every interview conducted over the past few months with labelhead mike simonetti and glass candy/farah producer johnny jewel hasnt convinced you let s music do it: is not an italo label in fact the reason the label has been so successful is that what they do is nearly impossible to categorize singer ida no adds an disaffected art pop vibe to glass candy farah narrates jewels synth webs in farsi and labelmate professor genius is too obsessed with sounding like nighttime city skylines to care much about spacer woman nd now which is definitely dance music but not completely the duo of eric tsai and justin simon feed every noise that they make through guitar pedals including the disconcerting vocals that on at least sound like theyve been smothered with vaseline and then chopped-up in the studio the music is just as murky s delayed guitars form the beautiful ascending/descending line that carries the track but it s the bass stab at the end of each measure or the spring-of-a-coil which transform it into something special simon has talked in interviews about his fascination with the area between house and noise music but icp better articulates the oft-fertilized ground between house and kraut both and have an undeniable groove that is girded by the beautiful melodies of neu (in many ways its similar to the music being made by seefeel in the mid-90s ) whatever you do just dont call it italo
late last year willie burns hosted jackmaster on his weekly radio show wtbs jack revill the hilarious scottish party animal and william burnett the wryly funny record store employee made for an odd couple especially during the interview sections but with the arrival of is the fourth record the duos partnership snaps into focus revill has something to do with the vinyl-only label look at his twitter account makes it seem like he does r for them using it as a personal outlet for modern beat tracks that fit nicely with his 90s chicago fixation on burnett pantomimes a number of vintage styles with his blocky emu sp-12-centric method offering up four infectious and idiosyncratic tracks burnett references a classic midwestern dance music title on but its unclear if hes looking back to d j deeon dj godfather or richie hawtins one-off as jack master in any event the music pays tribute to dance mania which initially feels awkward rhythm starts as a bizarre punky motorik before it falls into a miami bass formation with a few vocal samples bouncing off each other in lieu of melody title track is the eps least dj-friendly track and its finest moment utilizing the psychedelic live guitars and murky pulse that defined his black deer project burnett turns julie stapletons s into a mournful 4 d-style siren by mixing contemplative synth leads with vocal snippets lifted from the 1991 deep house track he finds a kind of forlorn experimental pop
vinyl only limited edition 300 hand-stamped copies labels seem to have a fascination with banding these terms around right now and its certainly a boat that hasnt left tiefschwarz and their souvenir label on the shore on their latest 12-inch one-sided two hundred copies through word and sound trades in all the release conditions thought upon (contentiously or otherwise) as signifiers of a high grade product the issue here being that no amount of exclusivity can compensate for a poor piece of music does execute a reasonable enough impression of spirited jazz house cut but onto its frame work is laid an effusive burnin -esque bass sequence and a ahem novelty three-note whistle its the kind of quirky turn that a kompakt or circus company could perhaps pull off in their own insouciant manner by the skin of their teeth but set against a scale-creeping low-end and fist flailing rhythm section the track opens its eyes not nearly wide enough to be bundled into the loveable scamp bracket days of ali and basti schwarzs scene-stealing remixes around the middle of last decade are unfortunately reduced to a hazy recollection by the time the needle drifts over the bonus beats version of the word of a forthcoming souvenir-based collaboration between the pair and cassy is probably the morsel to extract from this otherwise ill-advised outing

2005 full-length details is still held up by many as an exemplar of minimal house but davis has always operated slightly outside the scene that has embraced him the most details was a warm assemblage of glitch-laden house and honeyed vocals acting as an antidote to the more clinical tracks that relied on melancholic pads and comic squelches for their emotion that trend continues with davis newest ep his debut release on his own imprint the three songs found here all prominently feature davis vocals and you can immediately tell their tenor simply from the song titles way davis has lost none of his penchant for melodic backing as well works a stuttered synth to the bone to ecstatic effect as davis promises to remind you when youre down on your knees but coos ever so sweetly in the background all the while is the obvious hit though pitching a cut-up orchestra against a blistering tech house beat it sounds like its been beamed in straight from 2005 but considering no one has bothered to explore this territory much since then it sounds utterly fresh and beguiling like it did five years ago davis outsider status once again gives him an edge in a scene all too content to follow the latest sound
s releases often oscillate between music youd hear at a big club and music youd hear in an uber on a saturday night in london this is especially true of their two most recent releases outer the album they put out last year through their label and the major label polydor indulged their pop instincts and featured guest appearances from wiley and gary numan the ep is a return to servicing cavernous dance floors where the albums mainstream angle came with hits and misses finds nick harriman and alfie granger-howell doing what theyre best at these four tracks aim to make a splash and they mostly succeed is the least effective it climaxes with a synth that seems inspired by b b e s 1996 trance hit seven days and one week and doesnt quite nail its attempt at an inverted drop is maybe the most effective its underpinned by a deliciously simple bassline thats periodically swamped by a euphoric pad sound that would light up a club works along similar lines but is tonally brighter and has a garage-y swing in its step like has trance in its veins theres a polished arpeggio a string-driven breakdown and even some snare rolls to get the ice cannon firing if you tend to play to less than 300 people then maybe give a miss but for a certain breed of big-room dj this ep should do the job nicely
if awards were given out for productivity in would be second in the queue (after ) pair s cv for the past twelve months makes for dizzying reading under their various pseudonyms/collaborations they ve released on (deep breath) moodmusic get physical s w connaisseur kickboxer tsuba maschine and mobilee djs as diverse as ewan pearson to sister bliss to ze trendy germans have their s in the bag perhaps more than anyone then sum up the current mood in non us house music: one big communal tech/electro/minimal love in (mind you the accompanying press shot does them no favours it features the pair in full on i am a dj mode: wraparound shades sculpted facial hair distressed t shirts even more distressed hair sheesh did we not fight the great superclub war over this give me mad uncle sven dancing in his little blue shorts any day ) nyway according to the pair their debut mix cd undulations 2 is unsurprisingly an attempt to encapsulate into 80 minutes a whole night with nd on paper the mix looks exactly like that: an interesting selection of du jour producers including nummer s and bushwacka and the aforementioned mr and four of their own productions boxes ticked so far so good but there s a problem with undulations 2 and it s quite a fundamental one it s boring this is an issue that goes beyond arguments of taste genres and trends the tracks either don t do enough or take too long to do it re are moments along the way but these peaks are followed by occasionally very dull indeed troughs proceedings only really take off nine numbers in with the radio remix of press 2 but at that stage the jolt of energy feels a little bit predictable nd there s not enough bang for your buck in today s technological world thirteen perfectly programmed tracks in 80 odd minutes is not enough re is no middle ground with a mix like this: it will either appeal to you or it won t at all or to put it another way you either like progressive house or you don t but whatever your fancy the question remains: why if people on dancefloors across the world are having more fun than we can remember for years often to productions does this mix sound so dated and dull
following on from dj zinc and frictions critically acclaimed bingo sessions vol 1 from last year brazils dj marky (of marky xrs fame) steps up to mix the second installment of the bingo sessions series - for those confused the series tackles the breakbeat/2-step/grime side of things whereas bingo sessions concentrates its focus on the drumnbass side of things as per usual with markys mixes we can expect to hear unreleased exclusives double drops and scratches like he is highly recognised for marky kicks the cd off with one of his own tunes the vip mix of misto quente which translates to grilled ham and cheese sandwich the tune itself features a dreamy arpeggio line percussive break and a jazzy piano riff with lots of sweeps and lines in the background chase status who are known for their hard take on drumnbass deliver something quite unlike anything weve heard of from them with loves theme dropping a soulful vocal line with a sorrowful trumpet melody - all in all a very deep and moody feel on this one hospital records logistics continues with the hospital sound dropping funky synth work and melodic bass on top of really energetic beats on together marcus intalex then drops dark tribal beats tribal vocal stabs and deep hollow bass in afrikka plucked from his recently released long player 97 moody from influx uk picks up the pace a little bit more dropping charging beats and bass and we finally get to hear marky pull off a scratch routine in this mix - a very tidy one at that with marky scratching in time with the rhythm sub focus x-ray sends the mix into peak time dancefloor mode with a big synth riff and really energetic drum breaks not to forget the hard bass line action down below relative newcomers to the d b scene craggz parallel forces are getting into everyones record crates lately with their brand of infectious rhythms and catchy melodies here their flatfoot features a summery guitar lick ragga vocal stabs video game stabs a catchy bass line and gets the double drop treatment courtesy of marky siren by spirit picks up the aggression with a beat that leans towards the hardcore jungle days with crashing cymbals on the first beat of each bar and heavy rolling breakbeats with intricate snare work and is called siren due to the insane siren work used through out the tune this then leads into the first vocal tune in the mix with dj zinc and eksmans drive by car vip featuring mc eksmans quick oratory skills underpinned by a chugging bassline and heavy beat having never heard the first bingo sessions its hard to say whether this is an improvement on the series or not what i can say is that with the quality of the mix provided by marky here bingo sessions is certainly one series that fans of drumnbass should be looking out for when going for their d b fix
word has it that martijn deykers was approached to remix cid before his debut album was released and was incredibly keen but he was so busy that he didnt think hed have the time to do the mix justice now that great lengths is finished and out for consumption its time for deykers to get through his remix backlog and hes completed not one but two totally different versions of the track martyns mix is aimed squarely at the dance floor and even seems like a custom built tool for one of deykers own energetic dj sets flipping s original percussion into a soca-tinged broken beat track ala recent trends in uk funky the galloping drums and handclaps usher in two separate bass lines on either ends of the register swooping and intertwining as the tension is raised by eerie pads the interplay between multiple basslines and percussive flourishes is what really makes the track so successful with the tribal syncopation offering a much classier alternative to a lot of the second wave bandwagon jumpers that are putting out funky records at the moment the ittersweet mix is exactly that: a melancholic yet warm piano piece with the cowbell-esque sound from the original quivering away in the background whereas ridge from great lengths was a more spacious and measured showcase of deykers piano playing skills the rapid fire arpeggios on offer here show that the guy can definitely bang those keys s it was played to a rhythm track more adventurous djs can definitely get some use out of the mix to tease out a blissful beatless situation on the floor before dropping the beat back in digital djs also get a little bit more value for money as both mixes are at the same tempo and mix well with each other either way round

winners of the 2003/4 breakspoll awards for best producer best single for soul vibrates/bullet train and best remix for their dancefloor smashing take on the freestylers push up the have been hard at work producing tunes for their upcoming latest album this time the duo have aimed their focus squarely towards the dancefloor and revisited the formula from their first album a plump night out which saw them compile a continuous mix up of their own tunes mixed in with plump remixes and original tunes from like minded artists they begin the proceedings with a remix of lee coombs shiver giving the acid house meets breaks original a heavier break new bassline mixed in with lots of sweeps and electro stabs they follow this up with dr dub which samples an old thompson twins tune doctor doctor dropping big 80s sounding pop synths and drum beats on top of a 2-note bassline and electro licks the mix then leads into a hip hop sampling ditty from canadian producer sole claw aka myagi whose smartbomb sits on a deep plodding breaks tip with crisp hi-hats and a subtle bassline and if naples reeks of pounding kick drums hypnotic tech hooks dirty bass and rock guitar licks then madoxs smells like naples is right on the money acid hustle brings things back to the classic plump sound with a big bassline an acid hook which progressively builds up to a point of mayhem on top of a trademark plump beat post-climax they let the beats and bassline take control with wicked b-boy and steel drum breaks that kick in towards the end the rub off also harks back to the classic plump sound this time leaning towards the 80s disco funk sounds of tunes like plumpy chunks and the fever thanks in part to that dirty disco bassline and drum beat which creates the perfect lead-in to soul vibrates fingerlickin headhonchos soul of man present their latest tune foxy moron which is a highly charged number compared to what were used to from the boys and the plumps lay down an accapella of katherine ellis salty vocal hell up in harlem sounds like the plumps take on mjs classic hit thriller with a similar bassline electro arpeggios spooky synth sweeps and crazy acid stabs label mates the drumattic twins also present their latest offering twister which incorporates a funky horn lick a cut up vocal sample wobbly bassline and trademark dt breakbeats right before the plumps bring their mix to a close with their latest single - the massive get kinky which brings out a tweaked out bassline and prodigy-like beats (think firestarter ) is an enjoyable album to listen and brings back all we loved about the plumps from their plump night out release - big basslines big drum breaks and big lashings of funk to commemorate their success in this years breakspoll awards theyve made sure to mix the tunes and remixes that won their awards
along with artists like florian kupfer and max graef 23-year-old frankfurt native is part of a new wave of german producers but while hes appeared on around ten 12-inches in the past two years he might not be on your radar just yet this former drummer is not aligned with any in-vogue labels and generally sticks to a big room aesthetic more suited to ibiza crowds than to those with discogs accounts at the moment cocoon are his most high-profile supporters in addition to managing his bookings theyve released his latest effort the most notable thing about brachts productions is his attention to rhythm perhaps thanks to the all time spent behind a drum kit almost every cut hes dropped features a swung beat which gives his work a sense of groove that eludes so many of his peers this is clear on s title track which despite sounding like its been crafted with a festival crowd in mind features the kind of crafty shifting percussion that wouldnt sound out of place in a zip set sits on the flip and is less adventurous by comparison and for that reason probably wont get the plays of its a-side counterpart
last year pearson sound put out the first artist album on and now co-founder kevin mcauley gets his turn is similar in character to pearson sound : no-frills under an hour long and homing in on its producers idiosyncrasies but instead of being hermetic and understated practically leaps off the turntable from eyes-down bangers like memories to the jerky techno of viaduct mcauley has long made music that offsets its darker undertones with ecstatic rhythms his dj sets including his banner fabriclive mix are heavy on european techno with a spring in its step that style is exemplified across one of mcauleys most adventurous and sprightly records yet use your imagination and with its wobbly lfo bassline and whip-crack drums could be a track from 2008 is another with an older flavour powerful strings yelping vocals trembling basslines and it fidgets nervously with an almost giddy sense of motion is a twitchy objekt-style sprint with vocal samples smeared on top like vaseline a fine encapsulation of mcauleys odd brand of techno has a happy-go-lucky synth that wouldnt have been out of place on an old numbers 12-inch s sound design is excellent shining through on two shorter tracks that would seem like pointless diversions if they werent so sumptuous on the other hand mcauley sometimes overcooks the music like on the overstuffed or the 114 bpm dirge whose torpid tempo drags the albums momentum down during its closing run maybe the biggest hint of where mcauleys head is at comes at the very end at 140 bpm could have been a dubstep throwback nodding to the days when was still a promising upstart but its actually a techno monster built to rival the more conventional producers that mcauley often plays out the strength and vibrancy of shows that he could have made an album of techno bangers and got away with it stead is a vibrant diverse record that captures the best of s singular style looking backward as much as forward
my my s southbound might be the one near the top of a lot of playlists in the last month or two but for me its solo eps for us that have been his real treats in ria has already been given its fair share of glowing reviews and will only consolidate the proposition that jones is producing some of the grooviest and most subtle tech house out there at the moment a doubly appropriate alignment as us is effectively becoming the go-to label for similar works more than anything it s the musicality of jones drum programming that s impressive here every single hit no matter how small has been superbly crafted and articulated but it s not as if such filigree microsopics comes at the expense of the bigger picture is an early morning cruiser equally apt for breakfast listening or wild-eyed dancing has a much more nocturnal vibe easing you into the shade with a laser-cut pattern of drums and fx that create an opening for the melodic intro which has a plodding pokerflat-y bassline that gives absolutely no hint of the stab-led build to come ho hum you think when suddenly the whole thing begins to arc up and curl back on your head in a glooming wave recloose takes all this and turns it into a space-funk rocket toughening up the drums with an intro reminiscent of paperclip people turning the track inside out then upside down with the addition of some jazzy keys and a mangled vocal sample ll told this is intricate beautifully programmed solid as a rock and funky as hell

on the evidence of nyana tiesto is right at the top of his game as a dj and its easy to see why he pulls in the crowds what he provides here is over two hours of ebb and flow deep breakdowns rubbing shoulders with full on floor anthems the first mix (titled outdoor) majors on a minimal instrumental sound beginning slowly by building impressively throughout - a real journey early on tom mangans chutney reinterpreted by size 9 whizzes from left to right in the stereo picture a great effect on headphones this blends into the deeper than deep acapulco from the ambush a more tribal offering underpinned by deep keyboard sounds darren tates let the light shine in is outstanding hands in the air action as is midways anca tiesto himself turns in an excellent remix of dj cor fijnemans venus alongside his own nyana whilst solar factors sharp trancer urban shakedown raises the roof towards the close after such an outstanding first disc the second is more of a vocal offering despite its indoor title immediate stand-outs are holden thompsons nothing tiesto and filterheadz taking tina arena places shes never been before thanks to the excellent roc project and my pick of the mix which is andains beautiful things a wierd cut up vocal effect which proves to be rather haunting well if youve read this and are still not sure i would strongly urge you to hear this disc tiestos mixing keeps the music alive and interesting with a good variety of top quality trance music on display accept no imitations
for one reason or another divides opinion but regardless of how you feel the fact remains that since her arrival on the international stage a little over four years ago shes produced music that gets noticed on the singles front shes specialised in highly effective dj tools most with a level of charisma few producers working with the dance floor in mind can manage arrives through after a brief hiatus from releasing new material vailable as a double vinyl pack or digitally as a ten track bundle is clearly aimed at djs five of the six vinyl cuts are over eight minutes long and are characterised by lengthy intros and steady pacing opener epitomises the ep with an arpeggio vocals and driving low end working together for a cut thatll have little trouble winning over peak time dancers the hypnotism continues on the funkier after which produced with detroits takes things in a more brazen direction sporadic claps and white noise make it a track for techno jocks is a quiet achiever and the tidiest most rewarding thing here its breakdown free with tape hiss and stabs providing a brilliant platform for an enthralling vocal loop youd be hard pressed finding a better after hours tune this year

las house scene is in better shape than its been in a long time it cant hurt that a lot of the citys best artists reflect its permanently sunny skies and that includes the cosmic kids aka ron poznansky and dan terndrup yve been plugging away for years you might recognize them from eps on throne of blood and lets play and this solo 12-inch from terndrup for local label is the best thing theyve done a precocious and occasionally beautiful record thats heavy on classic synth sounds is like a sun-drenched landscape made of astroturf and artificial plants is bouncy and lightweight best example is planetisemal with its grand chord progression playing like a plastic orchestra accompanying a disco rhythm all blue-sky pads swirling synths and cheeky cowbells the track is sweet enough to rot your teeth yet totally addictive title cut is nearly as seductive albeit in a different way terndrups workaday rhythm provides a canvas for all sorts of melodic doodling from meandering basslines to brief vocal snippets that ghost by on the cool breeze jaunty might be the most smiley with an ecstatic flute motif and soft electric piano almost pushing it over the edge of good taste and take things to a reflective place marked by minor chords and gently plucked acoustic guitar ep is rounded off with the odd one out thanks to its reliance on a dominant vocal sample in the first half but with an ecstatic outro that dips its toes in acid-flecked techno (with killer quick-fingered synth adlibs) its every bit as joyous as the rest
22 year-old jeremy guindo aka is parisian but on first contact you would assume he lives in london the generalised interest in grimy warehouse techno; queasy funk synths that recall ikonika; chewy drums and fleet bass dabs that echo hessle audio (check synapse-snapping effervescence of ); his use of dubstep drops in restrained soft-focus repeatedly sounds like work of a whizz-kid producer riding uk bass musics creative entropy however guindo is no slavish acolyte he loves dubstep and uk funky but no sooner have you noted (all fluttering percussive arrhythmia ambient pads and lurching bass) as a sonic cousin of zombys spare vignettes than guindo is turning this notion of anglo- exchange on its head as well as bass music he adores african percussion and drexciya (see ) dance mania and that ghetto-footwork tradition as well as more orthodox house music all of which he channels in interesting off-kilter ways ei r he doesnt understand how to replicate his source material or he is deliberately skewering it ei r way even at his most derivative guindo is incapable of straight pastiche the key track is juke-inspired collaboration with fellow parisian producer a bizarre amalgam of plaintive piano breakdowns from mid-90s new york vocal house magnetic mans big-stage melodrama dj assault and a glossy hip-hop ballad it is that improbable thing: a sad song with a bloke repeatedly shouting let me get that ass over top of it only an avowed techno tool written on a plane to berlin really goes where you expect it to all knife-grinding textures and gradually emerging bleeps it is kind of tightly compressed machine-funk bomb that ben klock might drop little wonder that modeselektor love all this is right up ir irreverently eclectic strasse some of still sounds a little sketchy like a bunch of good ideas that have yet to coagulate into fully-rounded purposeful bangers but clearly jeremy guindo is a real maverick talent
erase hits its 8th release with a two tracker from a duo names the track is and it is a gritty piece of music the original mix uses a chunky and driving baseline as its main weapon as well as a series of smooth sounds and effects the track builds to a broken beat breakdown that sees some nice atmospheric effects combine well with a gritty electro baseline that lifts the track up another notch the crying mix is a moodier interpretation that has a darker theme thanks to the gloomy baseline and eerie vocal pattern however the track gets a little more upbeat deep in with some melodic patterns and funky electro baselines not a bad release here on erase but it certainly lacks the cutting edge making it extra special
when signed with warp over 11 years ago his music held fast to the labels long idm lineage but he brought something of his own to the table: funk and bags of it some of that material borrowed from dopplereffekts spartan electronics ( jefferson interception ) and other songs portrayed him as a cybertronic prince ( my beats ) edgars music has since freed itself of experimental kinks s still playful but instead of frenetic plaid-like twists the music unfurls to a steadier house and techno pace shine the latest ep for his label comprises clean aerodynamic dj tools that carry edgars fondness for hall-of-mirrors trickery feeds a staple house vocal through hardware which begins to take on a metallic tint as if it was sung down a waterpipe seems like a dance mania track forged from rubber and plastic its synthetic textures are cold and strange mirroring in some ways the ethos label makes relatable dance music that also feels alien dials down the eccentricity and its shine s least compelling inclusion in a way does the same when it reaches back to edgars funk and r b sensibilities that it doesnt feel out of place suggests his formative influences are still expressed through albeit projected onto a broader canvas
lets be clear: on musical boundaries remain unbroken chins remain unstroked and theres absolutely no chance of marcel dettmann dropping any of this at berghain but then none of that has ever been the point of and while theres nothing surprising about the nottingham bands seventh lp theres nothing disappointing about it either particularly if you want jim baron danielle moore and chris todd to turn out another album of pure party music as they do every few years thus saying that pretty much any of the tracks here could easily also have appeared on any album since they dropped the enis for 2005s last night earth is more recommendation than criticism ce again this is an album that in some ways sounds as glamorous as studio 54 yet also has an earthiness that makes it an unpretentious laugh ticklish basslines wah-wah guitars springing pianos anthemic choruses and tighter-than-lycra drums in tracks like and are at their best re may be something of an 80s soul and electro-pop influence creeping in here: is as high-gloss as chromeo but with the tongue thankfully removed from the cheek while could be a jellybean benitez remix of madonna in her prime but its not all music for pirouetting on the dancefloor or pouting into a mirror is a looser guitar-driven groove while the pianos turn more plaintive than pounding for heartbroken ballad still much of has clearly been produced to give more show-stopping ammunition for their live gigs which theyve taken to stages as big as glastonbury and as intimate as garden festival indeed if you want a perfect example of the driatic style discussed in garden festivals r exchange is it of course plenty of artists churn out records that are basically fodder for their dj sets but while that often fails to capture the atmosphere of the club do a good job of recreating what its like to catch them live thats largely due to moores vocals like lice russell she has just the right amount of grit and grain in her voice to make s music more than nu-disco of which theres hardly a shortage you could say theres no shortage of albums either but shows you cant have too much of a good thing

ugust saw the release of two new records but the lions share of attention was focused on the one foot head of the other double-pack for ramp s deepest retreat yet into the increasingly narrow musical agenda hes lately pursued ut if you felt that one foot demanded a bit of scratching beneath the surface to fully appreciate then this rigorously minor five-and-a-half minute 10-inch for spirited into shops at roughly the same time is both simpler and more immediate and offers two of s loveliest and most songful sides to date with their unfussy rhythms and spare settings these tracks sound far less agitated or spindly than anything from one foot the cyclical 8-bit melodies favors succinctly described by r s oli marlow as game over melodies bring their dizzy whirls to both sides of the record but this time theres an inescapably wistful air especially forgoes the delirious arpeggios for starker keyboard phrases shifting the focus from sequencing to the personality of his tari sounds which sound strikingly resonant and full here that richness is also abundant on the video game bleeps ranging from warm hums to digital shimmers to delicate tinkles for those concerned that there wasnt any more to this tari palette this peek at s more contemplative side delivers a pretty stiff rebuttal
emg and livejams john swing have taken their collaborative project in all sorts of directions across ten or so releases uniting quality throughout has been a grainy live sound thats once again evident on the vinyl-only on which the pair tackle more bruising analogue house built on dusty drums and a vocal motif with almost as much muscle as the central acid line the ten-minute crackles and swings with such intensity that it still doesnt feel long enough flipside starts with an mix of the much-loved disco 12 from 2011 the original of which was a rolling slightly spooky piece of hi-hat-driven house this version is surprisingly loungey and funk-influenced but its soft-focus keys and louche bass still come with a side of live drums finishes the ep on a darker note its menacing waves of bass and stark drum echoes are leavened only a shade by the kind of hip-hop sample weve heard swing do great things with many times before
named after the patron saint of rebels and outcasts s is actually a pretty inclusive record for brooklyns experts of percussive melting potting after all the bands breakthrough 2005s gods money was concussive first and foremost a raucous geographical tour that still showcased intricate melodic passages though itd be stretching to envision the quartets first real go at pop music theres noticeably more focus and musical centering going on throughout the bands forty-four minutes of rhythmic tumult vague detours into african and big-world sounds and josh diamonds increasingly striking guitar fills for the first time its tempting to search for narrative for threads of sense and story in the bands beautiful garbage-pit noise mongering ok narrative may be a stretch too; plots via verbal pastiche just listen to lizzie bougatsos slur out mcdonalds cashiers/ in a country where cows are sacred in a land where most people walk against dented-cowbell and industrial echo on really then as the bands refined its sound over the last few years its bougatsos herself whos asked to give these songs well songcraft shes always featured more as playground reveler amidst the bands vast experiments with beat and atmosphere than lead singer often a voice short of words that accidentally falls in tune to their clamor and lends it disorientation on s most impressive moments though and those that are as commercially handy as the bands ever been shes often asked to provide the bands chaos with rare clarity equal parts early madonna siouxsie sioux cyndi lauper and kate bush s finds her yoko-lizing over sinewy guitar lines gas-rainbow synths and pogoing rhythms while on the unfussy communion she blurts impressionistic lines about sea salt hips against one of the bands tighter guitar-drum arrangements for shes just a distant noise again briefly in a techno thump of middle eastern textures but its on lead single and album standout where bougatsos really shows her allure her damaged wail is suddenly clean pitched to melody over disturbance or distortion shes urgent to make new needs clear pulling the songs simple drums rave synths and layered background vocals taut into the alt-universe pop gem the band had been moving toward for an album so seamless that it repeats gods money s knack for highlighting passages over individual tracks some featuring three or four semi-connected patterns just as important for their few minutes or seconds as the song they fall within while still letting us see the internal logic behind each ending as it does the grime detour with east london mc seems from the surface like an awkward gaffe but s kinetic flow begins to make more sense as settles in over weeks yet another odd transition that pairs urban motifs with unurban rackets both allowed to bang away in the city its after all dump it in and theyll keep stirrin
exists only on the internet just a year ago producers lit internet (formerly yung ternet) lit daw (formerly usermane) and lit eyne (formerly gradientkid) reformed their production trio after dissolving bwwwoys a short-lived project that worked with the russian label hyperboloid the three members all between the ages of 18 and 25 live in ukraine sibera and the russian far east and have never met in person distant from their collaborators and uninterested in their local music scenes they rely entirely on file sharing social networks and remote communication is at the center of an amorphous sphere of young slavic internet artists who spread across the vast expanse of eastern europe have forged their own online community of graphic designers music producers gamers bloggers photographers and video makers we live in post-soviet countries and for people like us with our interests and hobbies and points of view it s a very uncomfortable zone lit internet explains in the press release for his groups debut album that sense like their peers in the non and naafi crews find virtual spaces integral to free expression and creativity perhaps because of their dependence on the internet and their sustained exposure to its aesthetics gravitate towards uncanny soundscapes hyperreal textures and stream of consciousness in their music releases like meta and 3000 may have been inspired by the physicality of clubs and their powerful soundsystems but what came out on the other side had more to do with abstract sound design and the shock of visceral frequencies sounds and structures outlined by jam citys classical curves and logos cold mission have always been a part of music even as they push the ideas into maximal extremes or strip them to the bare essentials realizes the brutal concepts of industrial music with digital ephemera pop culture runoff and the riotous energy of an illegal party was first released as a free download in march it was 11 tracks long and featured a number of disparate guests including nons hyperdubs and of naafi and others after being snatched up by was revamped and rearranged released now with sharper wider mixes beefed-up mastering and an extra track the newfound clarity and tweaked sequencing had a profound effect on the music think the difference between a bedroom mixtape and a fully realized hd sound world unlike albums working with similar sounds and references such as elysia cramptons demon city and antwoods remarkable virtuous scr has no conceptual narrative or even much of an arc to speak of where those records were in turns vicious and viscous is pure violence with seemingly incidental moments of calm celestial choirs appear in and giving the album brief but needed open spaces otherwise it cultivates an impenetrable chaos make the most of having too many cooks in the kitchen tracks like the quaking and the most satisfying solo production come closest to actual club cuts and when they bang they bang mercilessly one of the nastiest tunes drops in with a bass tone like a tunneling drill and a chrome-plated trap beat before it unravels into airborne industrial abstraction taking its title to heart constantly disintegrates rebuilds and sets itself afire started the first iteration of their debut album with a beatless piece of textural sound that now closes the record it worked fine as an intro (arguably better than the aimless ) but as an ending it makes even more sense sounding like a deconstruction of all the music that came before it follows its burst of fiery noise down to the last soft-glowing ember for lit internet lit daw and lit eyne serves as a beacon calling our attention to their faraway corners of the world and perhaps more importantly their online presence its only fitting that would close their blazing transmission with one last flash of light
its a game of two halves misses the mark with the uninspiring and only partially saves the day with the harsh minus meets robag outing that is so lets concentrate on s offerings both of which should be stored in the file marked initially unassuming club bangers pick of the bunch (by a whisker) is with its thudding kick enjoyably obvious one note bassline and catchy dbx on steroids central riff that soon spirals out of control pushing the percussion as it worms its way through the track not far behind is wobbly wonder which causes the same commotion using slightly different tools: the muted kick and hi hat struggle contain a stadium sized siren and well placed phased drops build drama nicely before some tough techno hi hats push this one over the edge is a talented producer who is developing something of a signature style his recent release on memo draws from a similar palette and rocks equally hard lets hope he keeps things fresh by pushing his sound in new directions and lets also hope he keeps on making initially unassuming bombs like this for a while to come
back in 1998 uk-based musician arab released a weirdly lo-fi yet fully formed album titled like weather ts main single feelings featured bedroom soul singer donna paul and fered a skewed take on r b a genre dominated by the glossy productions the likes timbaland the neptunes and rodney jerkins needless say s music felt like it belonged a world its own a feeling she then further developed on courtesy choice and blood looms blooms whereas that last one saw her working with a few o many vocalists (terry hall martina topley-bird as well as -affiliated luca santucci and own sister roya) this new u long player is a welcomed return form and s most gripping work date has always had a firm foot in the somber end the dm spectrum and most the instrumentals on u are stark demanding and completely intriguing for instance wouldnt sound out place on adult s very first release while nterlace or recall aphex twin at his most perverse (especially the latter with its skips and stutters and its overall sense unresolved tension) but this doesnt mean doesnt sound her time: is one part kuedo and one part ford lopatin with added creepiness courtesy a music box-like infantile melody u switches gears with a clutch collaborations with electroclash retiree and all-around weirdo mt sims which thankfully constitute half the material on display here a decade ago sims came across as the male equivalent peaches: but whereas peaches is stuck treading the same water mt sims went on work on an opera with planning rock and the knife and regained his artistic compass in the process n shows traces these experiences with its extravagant cooing but the track is also pretty much in sync musically speaking with contemporary bedroom electronica la laurel halo or sleep over and first single have mt sims surrounded by agitated buzzes and abstract rhythmic patterns while and have an industrial throb that is both lurid and commanding these tracks were apparently written over a very short period time last year after the two met at a party decided work gether and finalized everything online yet despite the albums title this isnt music about communion or an actual exchange nstead its all about alienation: from society ( we are not the countries that weve been investing in chants sims on u ) from technology (the artwork is supposed represent a hard drive crashing down) and from the people we meet just look at the generally dis rted syntax the song titles and they way they seem prefer vaguely poetic under nes over any sense straightforward comprehensive meaning ts as if u was also asking you make sense its compelling sonic mess
its natural to expect an album to unfold with a certain logic if not a narrative arc the second proper lp from swed h duo (abdulla rashim and varg) stubbornly rejects that idea yes these seven tracks of deep full-immersion techno share a doomy tone and sonic character they are raw and filthy woody and tribal but otherw e they operate as self-contained units the swirling ambient fog of the parting shot you might expect but otherw e from the confrontational techno of to the epic ear-splintering drone-piece fr n b let these tracks seem to jostle against one another in a forbidding jumble as you absorb however that begins to feel deliberate seem to be evoking a world without order in the humid under is whose tuned-drums and slippery basslines create layers of counterpointed rhythm or the blasted a peak-hour techno track stripped to its skeleton and subject to howling nuclear winds reaches back to the primordial swamp and forward to a post-apocalyptic future humanity and civil ation are notable by their absence the landscape here deserted mysterious naturally chaotic far from being just another dour techno record feels like a fitting soundtrack for a world that politically and ecologically careening towards d aster there enough grandeur and finessed complexity here to suggest that was conceived as an artwork rather than a bunch of club tracks the close sometimes ambiguous detail incredible is there really a synth-string motif buried in the mix on under is or it some sort of auditory hallucination created by its sizzling stratum of bass reverb and d tortion likew e the way the bone-dry tribal rhythms of vita stenarna are subtly mutated across its six minutes a masterclass in patient control there a lot of techno around that likes to present itself as serious and high-minded in its intent and execution but th the real deal and its exhilarating
in naming his label corner after the hbo tv show that preceded wire sought to convey the street knowledge of his youth and perhaps the grittiness of his records name also alludes to parasoles role in a small yet vital network: the new york techno family that includes fred p jus-ed and levon vincent his techno has resonated beyond the five boroughs hes a resident at berghain and has released eps on the berlin clubs ostgut ton label parasoles debut album arrives on rather than ostgut ton or corner but the same attitude remains renews the tension that runs through parasoles music opening the album with what sounds like a swarm of wasps around a collapsing building aside from a couple of downtempo tracks too claustrophobic to be called breathers the meat of the album is beefy techno made for dark sweaty basements beat on sounds as though its underground pounding the pavement from beneath is tighter than a clenched fist and few records have ever sounded as singleminded as where a voice repeatedly intones bang the drum over tribal percussion and a sledgehammer stomp se tracks will do serious damage on a dance floor which seems to be the extent of parasoles vision for them in the process of making parasole said he listened to jazz and hip-hop for inspiration though something like the title track could have been made by someone whos listened to nothing but steve stoll and joey beltram records for 0 years ( ly the piano and rhodes-led loop on carries a discernible jazz influence ) a track like couldve come from vincents self-titled 015 album though the relatively rigid sound on makes it a different beast to vincents more experimental and ultimately more rewarding lp is an often powerful exercise in purist eyes-down techno its gaze rarely wanders
roughly six months after their debut release berlins are doing about as well as any deliberately cryptic vinyl only imprint could hope despite having no association with any established labels or well known artists their records have consistently gone out of stock in online shops and been picked up by the likes of efdemin ben klock steffi and zip to name just a few though fairly specific in terms of style their sound has diverse appeal: modern but classic raw but tight and somehow equally suited to both peak time and afterhours their third release the mysterious livejam crew mostly stick to their guns but trade their often twisted hooks for more conventional classic house fare features four of livejams usual suspects: and heads up the a side (or as the label text states theese moments ) with a fierce party track that rides a single chord and a quick loop of a b girl saying each and every weekend its probably the labels most by the numbers tune yet but its club potential is hard to deny follows up with a much more subtle offering that anchors a far off diva moan with a foggy deep house arrangement the flip side (i e thooose moments ) gives us the majic a track that starts out drab then leaps in energy following yet another diva line this time saying you know what im talkin about just like on the vocal part is cheesy but well executed after the druggy minimalist intro youre not expecting such a generous hook close out the ep with another surefire party track with a vivid high contrast aesthetic like the rest of the ep its undoubtedly fun but following the far flung weirdness of earlier livejam tracks (the skeletal feel of moon quarter the vocals on winter night and spreading love ) its decidedly retro vibe is just a tad disappointing nonetheless all four tunes are distinctive nicely crafted club cuts and well worth checking out especially if youre a dj
in 2002 dessous boss released a record called big fake under the name traffic signs whole track revolved around a seemingly bland hook but the track became a huge hit anyway the first track on dessous best ept secrets 3 seems to follow a similar pattern on the surface its not so interesting a slightly jacking beat forms the tracks spine and a vocal sample regularly announces its title hook is a piano like synth which loops to infinity exciting huh still the tonk tonking motif has been stuck in my head for a couple of days and im not sick of it yet s is a little more song like again piano esque notes form the guts of the track except this time twinkly arp hits and genteel pad strokes come out to play percussion is mostly raspy but for light hand drumming in the mid section sounds like a leftover from s album earlier this year (thats a good thing if you were wondering ) here australian artist also jumps in to collaborate the pair forging a summery number with hints of vocal a langurous bass sequence and wincing toms bolster the rest of the track with shimmering pads and clear bell like tones wafting on top s is far more exuberant hung around an undulating beat and rapid fire vocal assualt two note synth stabs are also a central feature a slow opening filter brightening them more and more as time goes on
fter the comparative lightness offered up on 10 s twisted disco theme the labels eleventh instalment turns back towards the dankest depths of freak show house for a late night mongout the three deep cuts on all slog along with a druggy charisma at a pace barely capable of carrying a pulse delivers perhaps the most pleasant offering on the side making use of a repetitive bassline to lead a dozing shuffly dance through a subtly uplifting string pattern and clicky analogue drums gentle build and lack of release lends the track an ethereal tension capable of simultaneously inducing a sense of madness and wired catharsis for fans already familiar with s esoterica s most exciting moments come courtesy of label newcomers and who both turn in brooding numbers laden with a blase menace s horror score vocal breathes down the neck of its unwitting victim muttering paranoiac threats before unleashing a huge bass flex to deal the murder blow its a unique and rattling dub house hybrid capable of building an uncompromisingly brutal atmosphere should any dj be brave enough to try and tame it on a big system s debut could be a field recording taken directly from the crypt of a long lost phantom factory inaudible conversations get lost amidst a dubby atmospheric too weary to be affected by the menace imposed by the whirring analogue machinery busily running in the foreground bass drum pedal even creaks in desperate need of oil a nuance perfectly complementary to the arid taste in the mouths of the cranky afterhours clubbers its aimed at

when you think of you probably think of african rhythms that swirling mishmash of percussion and chanting that was inescapable when it finally saw release on l i e s in 2012 (its origin story goes back to 2008 and it was first featured on a jam city mix in 2009 ) african rhythms is far from a club anthem but it helped define the diy spirit that was gripping house and techno at the time that song and its counterpart love triangles laid the blueprint for nik dawsons career a warm soupy sound as approachable as it is weird dawsons first album is a hodgepodge of tunes dating back to when he lived in san francisco and was conjuring heady jams on an mpc it also dips into the mechanized techno he was making last year listening through the album is like listening to an alternate history of his discography retold through unheard music is split over two records which turns out to be quite a divide the first half is sunny with two stunners that nicely outline what makes dawsons style so engaging the twitchy settles into an easy slow cook before a vocal and piano gently take it on a detour the lengthy centrepiece that takes up all of side b turns out to be s best track on the surface its typical an airy rush of techno but with a creeping energy that takes advantage of all 18-plus minutes stead of riding the rhythm dawson staggers his chords so that they suddenly stutter or run into the next bar its a trick that keeps your ear tracked firmly to the lead rather than keeping it locked on the groove on the other 12-inch dawson moves on to gritty particulate matter and viscous sloshing sounds while these tracks are less catchy theres no less to grab hold of moves like a slow-motion sandstorm while coasts on a snappy but crestfallen bassline like something from midtown 120 blues given a steely techno makeover only seven minutes of engine-room ambience fails to make an impression but its a welcome way to wind the album down after six lengthy workouts connects the dots between recent records like touchless automatic and dawsons brighter early work though the aesthetics have changed over time the approach hasnt and dawsons most engaging traits are still here his tracks catch the ear because theyre unlike so much other gridded dance music loaded with human touches tunes are intimately linked to playing live performances where he either improvises or creates new material almost every time a thrilling excursion like doesnt come from careful planning you get it in the heat of the moment that spontaneity keeps dawsons music fresh whether its from last year or eight years ago is his freshest collection yet a survey of one of house musics most delightful oddballs
is a hell of a techno tool made by one of its most enthusiastic craftsmen rarely welds much else his releases are singularly focused on plotting the shortest route from a to b but theyre so crisply edited that it becomes a virtue that direct approach offers a lot of scope for reinterpretation and so arrives with three remixes one of which is helmed by himself that none of these deviate too much from the mans surefooted original is a big compliment on youll find ticking hi-hats generous claps and a cyborgs incantation over a simple midi note sequence the only thing jimmy edgar applies to this is a single top note on the offbeat and s rework adds little more than a plastikman-ish throttle to the subtly rearranged frame kris turns into a luxuriant house roller whose warm pads soak through the sinewy original bearing the smoothness of a concept car the aerodynamic is so striking that the remixes though far from superfluous cant do much to redesign something made with such clean assertive lines
steffi is an old-school crate digger after years of searching and collecting her sets are just as likely to contain little-known 90s gems as they are this months anthems accordingly steven tang feels like one of the most appropriate artists to have appeared on her label whether working as or misguided he seems to have made a career out of flying under the radar the cut on his latest record is built atop blockish acid during the first few bars it looks unlikely the bassy coarse 303 will recede though as tang introduces soaring pads and a liquid-like arp it quickly loses ground its a good example of tangs dynamic arrangements which tend to fade seamlessly from scene to enthralling scene like dreams somewhat doleful the title track also adheres to this description legions of pretty melodies bumping cautiously against one another and momentarily forming into various shapes is more perky pairing sprightly drums and claps with rippling drawn out notes the contrast is simple yet works well is perhaps the most analogue-sounding of the bunch though it still retains a majestic watery sense of peace here great sweeping pads gently push and pull while more angular notes dance a merry jig in the foreground
the latest from norman cooks southern fried imprint is a split ep with two tracks by a collaboration between lawrie dunster and francesca lombardo and one from dunster and keith tenniswoods project s is the eps standout moment a bruising busy electro stormer it weaves together a full fat acid bassline with flashing synths and heavily distorted guest vocals from though thats the track that sticks in the mind s contributions are not without their charms mines noirish techno territory via a thick humming bassline and fluttering effects over which lombardo eventually adds faintly diva ish vocals is true to its title a combo of mesmeric bass and a conga drum loop make for a ritualistic foundation which is overlaid with flashing tendrils of synth and lombardos twisted vocals oth will fit readily into plenty of sets even if theyre not the most talked about moments at the end of the night
is the latest alias from diego herrera the la producer also known as suzanne kraft his new self-titled ep arrives on the label offshoot of a melbourne party of the same name (herreras second record for an australian outfit in the last three months following novembers tracks for performance on noise in my head) its name might suggest something testosterone-driven but shows herrera doing what he does best: crafty deep house with a balearic tinge s a-side steals the show is a lean club track with a tongue-in-cheek sense of drama full of backwards drum fills glassy chords and a kitschy eastern melody the drums have an almost electro crispness to them something thats also true of the other two tracks and both of which are peppy beat work-outs with a sun-kissed sheen those two are good dj tools but its the a-side that like most of his recent records marks out herrera as an inspired artist on a roll
the heart of mexicos dance music scene resides in mexico city cobra voyage an electronically inclined production company and one of the capitals key players expanded its radio film and events repertoire in 2013 to include a label for the second release the focus is on four homegrown producers with aims to showcase mexicos emerging techno community aside from who featured in boiler rooms mexico debut late last year the artists on keep a low profile of the three enigmas is the most visible (he has a facebook page) his track is a slice of sweet-sounding techno that lays echoed synths and delicate keys across a low-slung drum break s is harder hitting channeling the dark catchy style of tale of us through solid kicks and a menacing synth line on the flip s is less successful leaning too heavily on an eerie and rapidly grating string loop the ram wraps up the release with an earnest cut of groove-centric tech house
at the risk of sounding like one of those crappy film trailer voiceovers: in a world of nice-but-average house music does things differently the dresden-based producer cites growing up listening to hip-hop on us forces radio at home in karlsruhe as an early influence his debut for certainly shows an ability to lay down anvil-heavy beats builds in intensity using puffing steam engine percussion before opening out into an eerie meeting of diabolic strings and crazed glockenspiels on its not just the name thats odd the touchstone is classic deep house you can tell theo parrish is another hero but theres something brilliantly unnerving about the soulful vocal sample while the beats lollop and list so randomly they sound like theyve been thrown up in the air before settling into place on the mood clicks back a notch with what sounds like some twisted native american chant drifting in and out of the fuzzy throb and stumbling tempo arguably best of all unfurls from a melancholic opening with a quivering low-register bass motif into a quirky deep house burner with blobs of congas and a cannily employed acoustic guitar sample

in the press release for s new single theres little talk of the actual music instead they throw it over to ferrer for a lengthy analysis of how the track was put together for those that care ive been told its fascinating reading ut i dont care about u d comps im probably pretty lucky that ferrer does though as even a novice like me can often hear how ridiculously sharp his productions are whether you like ferrers work or not theres no denying that its put together with the utmost care ( nd that hes probably thrown away 37 versions before he gets to the final one ) ferrers studio prowess would mean nothing without his ear for a hook though and that remains firmly in place with in both versions here its a release for better or worse that was made for the digital age the vocal will make plenty of underground djs wince the dub will be too boring for the mainstream ut each undoubtedly stand out in their spheres: the vocal version has a rough and ready performance that sounds more post-punk than soulful house but whose untrained nature gives this almost more personality than it can handle (even defected thinks so having picked it up for re-release in march of next year ) for the underground heads though theres also the dub which sounds as if it was recorded with the express intent of being mixed into martin uttrichs stoned utopilot that or just about any epic that youd like to use to destroy the floor if youre not content with this one already that is

s experiments with uk dance music seem to have extended to gutting its very foundations this is the hook of this track intones a deadpan female voice on scare the hook is the bit you pay attention to what you actually pay attention to is s percussion curiously filtered and clipped and arranged into sparse patterns the beats subtle swing rendering the atonal vocal ever more ironic itd be easy to write off as a dj tool: this stark percussive music has an obviously utilitarian quality theres also something subtle at work a self-referential humour in the vocal countered by the almost introspective production uk funky mutation has a melodic hook but its thoroughly bizarre it opens with skeletal percussion and a series of melancholic chords that ascend slowly and then disappear into a bed of rustling sound only to reemerge as an organ pattern that wouldnt sound out of place at a haunted circus it lacks the verbal signposts of but is every bit as self-referential breaking its fourth wall with a pause and rewind its as though has taken the constituent elements of dance music apart and put them back together deliberately incorrectly these tracks may be experimental and eminently suited to the club but theyre also endlessly compelling demanding multiple revisits if only to delight in their eccentricity

with all but one of them clocking in somewhere around the four-minute mark the tracks on praveen sharmas debut for friends of friends feel more like pop songs than anything built for the dance floor such is the gushing mood of everyones a smouldering brew of half-cooked vocal samples and analogue synths that its best consumed alone follows a similar pattern but with nods to floaty early 90s balearic the relaxed atmosphere is maintained on where sharma buries raw tribal percussion but allows a killer jazz guitar loop to take centre stage at this point sharma introduces some hammering uk rave revivalism in complete with digital seagull noises and burial-style stretched vocals ts the one moment where he goes off-script although even here theres a sense of languor at less than 100 bpm and with ultra-emotional chords brought to the fore hes quickly back in plaintive mode on the packages most unconventional offering comes in its final few breaths building in intensity through a storm of discordant strings t with its madlib-style sped up/drawn out vocal juxtapositions closes out a warm-hearted if a little too one-paced ep

smooth swiss operator has been spreading himself around of late stepping away from his usual music man home to release records on circus company stilove4music and in this case you can understand why: in each instance sam geisers productions have sounded remarkably different for circus company he went a bit quirky allowing seth troxler to take center stage for stilove4music it was dusty deep house and disco in collaboration with nick chacona edwin oosterwal and joris voorns label sees get expansive epic in the way that the duo seem to envision the imprint over its past few releases with stimming 360 and quince fulfills this obligation with a rotating melody that tickles all of the melodic techno pleasure centers rising and rising for four minutes before a hi-hat arrives to push the track toward the fist-pumping territory efore that youre content with a kick willing to see how long geiser can extend the feeling there are no such concerns on s its title might suggest gets to the heads-down business early and stays there the break is more than healthy extending to about 30 seconds but geiser ensures that you dont get lost its prog for the 21st century without all the bad stuff that might entail
is in a strange place right now internet forum boards resemble refugee camps for jaded ex-junglists bemoaning the creative standstill of drum n bass and its continued descent into cheesy over-hyped rave territory which is why the rise of wobbly dubstep dominated by piercingly overt synths is so very perplexing it is as if this style has emerged from a vacuum blissfully unaware of the misgivings of its older sibling is one such artist who has come under fire for pushing a sound that emphasizes the elements so many former junglists grew to despise in dn so much so that dubsteppers have taken to lazily tagging this sound as jump-up hastily snatching the term from this much maligned subset of jungle indeed too is eerily reminiscent of the most obnoxious brash sounds of new-school dn albeit juxtaposed with the most generic of half-step rhythms sadly the flipside fares no better endlessly wobbly insistently squealing synths lodge their way into the listener s ear sounding not unlike a tc remix of clipse on 33 this kind of mid-range tomfoolery and simplified beatplay is exactly the thing that inspires the most heated vexations from discerning junglists and likewise their dubstep brethren hence s take on dubstep seems like a distinct step backwards for the genre one moment of relief comes in the mildly comedic phone message skit in the breakdown as label mate caspa states: its capsa what the fuck are you doing this is bollocks you ve gone too far this time uite could it be that the title of the -track is a knowing acknowledgment of pushing the stylistic template of coki s spongebob beyond all reasonable measure whatever the case the ensuing racket makes for dubstep of the most obnoxious order soulless agitation utterly devoid of groove or nuance

completists must be having a financially strenuous time of late detroit badman has kept up a great lick of releases since late 2011 and introduced a number of new names in the process 998 does the same with offering up three originals and one tune from that peel away from standard 4/4 kicks and off into dark dense electro and techno territory opens the ep with a studious air of mystery thanks to haunting keys that float between heat damaged synth and percussion sounds listing to it is like treading water you hang just about in the same space for the duration if tim burton made electronica this might be what it sounded like is textbook where the rough brushes up against smooth with beguiling results characterised by typically 80s sounding and unresolved atari melodies the sandy scuffed underside keeps things from getting too harsh s doesnt bother with the softer side: its raw brutish and punchy techno that bangs end to end returns for the finale 3c which offers a final curveball in the form of a lively sparking yet superbly introspective electro jam re seems to be plenty of fuel in his tank at the moment ignore him at your peril
though seemed to appear out of nowhere last year his debut album ---- has the considered approach of a producer with more than just a few releases to his name in its press release karmil explains that though hes been making music for years he had no intention of releasing anything until recently when it was reportedly coaxed out of him by kompakt artists popnoname and da its not hard to see why karmils work resonates with the kompakt crew like many in the cologne labels family the englishmans productions are warm rich and heady treading the line between funktion one stacks and home stereos grounded in house the aesthetic across ---- s eight tracks is hazy but far from lo-fi side from the occasional piano stab tape hiss and acid squelch most of the sounds here are unrecognisable its clear that karmil obsesses over the samples he uses and the rewards are obvious first of eight tracks is a murky six-minute workout that sets the tone for the rest of the album for the most part the next 45 minutes see subdued kick drums paired with simple unobtrusive basslines both serving as a sturdy platform for karmils collages of moody samples like a lot of quality deep house the emphasis is not on snappy drums or swing but on atmospherics karmils deft approach creates some truly immersive moments and the highlights come when the tracks stretch out t ten minutes long (float) is one of the albums choice cuts its not much more than a simple loop where the same short string and keys samples repeat for its duration in many respects ---- is an example of classic minimalism but those weary of the tag risk missing out on the warmth of karmils palette and the unique charm that comes with it
are a british duo comprised of david brun brown and james taylor who produce minimal dub techno laden with vocals the group are now into their fourth album loops from the bergerie the title being a play on serge gainsbourgs 60s soundtrack to the movie les loups dans la bergerie the bergerie is the name of a country house near montpellier which was converted into a studio and its influence played a big part in the creation of the album rather than creating the album on a laptop replaced it with analog equipment from the 70s and 80s percussionist francesco brini incorporated live instruments into the sound as well the opener keep it coming embraces an 80s retro feel utilising a disco guitar lick and features brun on vocals another way continues more of the same 80s feel featuring old skool electro style handclaps a catchy synth hook and this time features richard davis (a signee to s 240 volt label) on vocals my house has a dubby feel to it with drum beats featuring dub influenced effects using lots of echos and delays richard davis features again on vocals and sings atop a melodic bassline and plenty of techy stabs snowblind has a retro 70s feel sounding like a techno take on the doors sound featuring a bluesy piano riff pounding bass that hits on every downbeat and plenty of retro percussion to give it that classic feel 8080 features a shuffling beat heavy on percussive elements massive bass line acid stabs the second phase features hard hitting bass drums and a rich percussive break which continues for the duration of the tune finally the album closes out with the dark and downtempo tones of the long night a long electronic sweep introduces the tune before a massive attack style drum beat kicks in accompanied by a melodic bass riff lush spoken words vocals for both tunes are taken care of by mathilde mallen not being much of a techno fan it was a surprise to hear this album - deep dark tones accompanied by technos tough four to the floor kick drum beats and vocals thrown in on top the live instrumentation gives the album a nice warm and organic feel whilst the vocalists add another dimension to the music

as many of you may know are jondi and mark musselman who hail out of san francisco remember this as their music is sure to make a big impact in the near future that is if it already hasn t their remix of cass s mind rewind received great reactions and this new record out on bedrock s new breakbeat imprint ( ) is just as impressive on the outer a side we have s original mix of sunsicle it is quite simply a stunning piece of ambient work smooth soft beats are layered underneath soothing strings and subtle effects the track maintains a steady pace and clear direction and uses a subtle breakdown midway before it continues in its merry ways on the inner a side is the rock candy mix of sunsicle a soothe string begins the track but then fades out with a differently shaped drum loop than the original put to use similar effects remain but a baseline is added and it takes an important role throughout the production it s another brilliant rework of sunsicle giving another angle on an already impressive original on the b side is the very brilliant donner pass the atmospheric intro makes way for solid broken beats to kick start the track an evil two line baseline then grabs you by the balls as subtle effects also fill the air midway into the track we are treated with a breakdown that sees the baseline change and gain a few notes and also welcomes the arrival of an eerie yet hypnotic melody the beats effects baseline and melody all meet to create a wonderful fusion of sound brilliant following the pretty sturdy locked on is here to stay with this release it should also show that its not here to put out run of the mill breaks but rather like its father label quality is assured
juan pablo s music can get ridiculously over-the-top so he was an interesting choice for an imprint which despite its small catalogue has attracted a lot of attention for their surreal industrial techno its a style which seems to be divining quality from the various artists who get involved and s aggressive stance marries harmoniously with the labels dystopian aesthetic continuing the storming monochrome of the monad series nicely the two full-on techno offerings and are peak-time steam trains thundering through deep wastelands and billows of mist the first takes the empty hollow pounding of a distorted kick and holds it taut over rumbling sub-bass while clanking folds of white noise envelop the chugging in between building and forming into towering pillars of hellish glory repecticion is a cleaner cut but were talking relative here whiplash bursts penetrate the darkness as the drums roll along with as much momentum as they have cold foreboding cavernous dubstep-style pressure is applied by its distant furious tantrum threatening to distort the foundations of whichever metallic dungeon it is encased within is alien ambience with a throbbing heart that sounds like its influenced by plastikmans consumed but more viscerally evil creepy shimmering sits underneath the snarls of myriad nameless wraiths taking us to plutonian swamps at the edge of reality and beyond
new zealander debuts on poker flat with a slice of emotive techno that is not only good but is also a more than reasonable imitation of jeff mills and robert hood during their axis period in the early nineties built on a melody that undulates and drives through a never-ending subterranean tunnel peaks and troughs cleverly to give the impression of drama re are moments when it threatens to go off on a tangent but it never quite does instead ending up at its point of departure s a cyclical journey that doesnt disappoint redshapes discodub has a slightly harder edge turning up the pressure with a heavy kick and spasmodic jets of melodic white noise all the elements of the original remain but like a lot of recent remixes the trick is in the slight rearrangements most telling difference is that the volume has been raised ever so slightly meanwhile mark subtly funks the track up keeping the high-end arpeggio and the poignant background waves of sound but opting for a more shuffling beat works very well given that the pace of the original isnt quick so is imitation the sincerest form of flattery im not saying that these tracks arent original rather that they update a sound somewhat while this record doesnt offer much that is new it does show how far ahead of the game the second wave of detroit never mind the first were all those years ago

bedrock breaks sees the mighty teaming of hernan cattaneo and john tonks put out two block stomping mixes of the original mix is a powerful combination of neat and tight percussion that carves out a rhythm at the beginning while subtle stabby synths act as a precursor to whats to come next briefly the beat drops out and is replaced by emotive atmospheric pads that together with the hypnotic synths start to lift the track further as the bassline pitches slightly before gradually rez-ing up to the break and blossoming into something sublime pure peaktime breaks next up is the big bass mix which is a more grinding affair as seriously tweaked synthlines crank up the pressure in contrast to the originals dreamy vibe breaking with an awesome guitar riff to make any dancefloor shake throughout theres a constant underlying soundscape of angry cuts that only inject even more into the already funked-up attitude this is massive
industrial techno is routinely described as dark pounding abrasive those adjectives could easily apply to but the duo see their 90s-inspired machine noise differently describing it as transcendental (indeed 2014 ep kundalini referenced yoga ) similarly la monte ng and marian zazeelas new york-based dream house invites visitors to meditate to the needling modular oscillations inside the agitated techno of s may gesture towards that kind of psychoacoustic trance but its method is completely different its hard to imagine as an introspective moment its speed and ferocity breach gabbers boundaries but if your focus shifts from the scarred surfaces to the viscous rhythms the track takes on a surprising lightness thats mostly down to s sloshing grooves contained by rail-straight drums and a boiling arpeggio the rest of refurbishes the mechanistic grind of 2014s cosmic microwave background lp the surgeon-evoking extends the thread of cosmic strings and both b-side tracks elaborate on the albums flayed surfaces and prickly ambient passages the distorted kick on seems best suited for pounding meat in an abattoir but have a talent for creating mesmeric rhythms with ugly sounds that tracks circuit board spasms cycle through glitchy loops as if grappling with broken computer code until a disfigured pattern emerges a low-voltage dribble of welding sparks and vibrating metal evokes a workshop where deconstruct their drum machines whatever moving parts remain emit something between a nervous twitch and a murmur like a robot being stirred from sleep
maybe its because my listening-for-work habits have been commandeered by minimal over the past few years but anyone brash enough to go the deep house route rhodes vamps pop vocals in the current climate is going to grab my attention not least because this stuff functions as color when dropped among minimals greyscale climes one of the first times i heard this i flashed on lazes lovelee dae as precursor and im not alone english dubstep producer ppleblim also made this parallel in his dj feedback thats because motorcitysoul understand how to tailor a traditional song structure while maintaining track-head utility so the production is streamlined without being ascetic much like lazes classic describes both a structural and emotional arc and its genre signifiers work crescendo breakdown and the extended tease of the intro are all potent because theyre delivered so flawlessly some of this is also down to ovasoul 7s vocals which stay just the right side of creamy or overly performative avoiding the cornball melismas that clutter many deep house songs while still accessing the emotional overflow distinctive of the genre truth be known hes a bit like robert owens with less kilometers registering on the dial on the flip shur-i-kan loops ovasoul 7s devotional sighs so they become obsessive-compulsive tics spinning them out across a rhythm with a skip in its step while gorgeous flecks of texture-melody wind around your ears theres a particularly lovely section about six minutes in where shur-i-kans mix peaks and youre left with a beautifully languid relatively empty coda a sweet aftertaste its lovely though the originals the strongest of the pair

max is a promising new name in techno in the past two years hes put out sleek mills-ian cuts on unterton (ostgut tons sub-label) marcel dettmann records and his own boutique imprint (not to mention a badass smoke machine podcast ) on all of these releases he complemented his linear grooves with s hk -esque sound design an impulse he indulges more fully on the a-side is completely avant-garde on rolling drones gradually increase in pressure and then taper off untitled is a sketch centered on a bit of post-punky poetry ( we thought that the truth and that which is true were the same thing ) that ends after less than 30 seconds begins with cluster of ghostly loops impressively vivid clicks rattles and so on then veers into an abyss of sub-heavy ambience before circling back to its opening arrangement the beat-driven tracks make up the b-side 5 is a lean strip of techno that like s past highlights is as spacey as it is sinister at just 115 bpm is more left-field with a gloomy choir and the occasional peal of feedback then for some reason we get a reprise of the untitled poem its admirably adventurous but also a bit bland has clearly got something special but here he could use some more flair
dutch bubbling a kinetic dancehall mutant invented in the late 80s by surinamese and dutch antillean immigrants seems ripe for picking by current global club producers delfts anti-g combined bubbling with garish dutch house for a planet mu album in 2011 but otherwise there has not been much recent crossover with the wider dance music world as with anti-g who landed the planet mu deal at the height of uk funky fever eindhoven producer benefits from bubblings similarity with the london style her deft fusion of the two rhythmic disciplines isnt the only thing that makes her a good fit for the london label she like label poster boy tsvi is a functionalist where much current club music favours contrast and collision her drum tools throw djs a bone also like tsvi missdevana is happy to let her drums do most if not all of the talking apart from a demonically down-pitched vocal tag and a janky two-note riff that enters when the track bizarrely speeds up in the coda is just percussion its dense grid of lilting hi-hats hand percussion and soca snares sits snugly against a technoid 4/4 groove the rest of the ep has a looser reggaeton-like feel gets the lions share of melody in the form of a shrill midpoint loop swathed in tinny reverb its bookended by a sub-110 bpm dembow rhythm against which percussion hits tug like kittens on a trouser leg is similar but more obnoxious thanks to its sandpaper hi-end and a pitched up aaah that quivers with manic energy
fter grabbing attention with an excellent 12 on vinyl lub and a contribution to the first release of romanian label rpiar now makes his debut on lucianos adenza imprint with a four track ep of quite astounding quality espite romanian producers emerging quite rapidly throughout techno over the last few months this ep is perhaps the first time one of their number has appeared on a label with as wide a reach as adenza nd judging by the vastly different set of sounds used here is also an ep which will mark out inspirescu as one of the most exciting new producers around the 1 is the first of four eleven minute tracks on this double vinyl release its a slow burning and hypnotic piece of house music with serrated percussion and spliced zither-like melodies the dazzling level of detail is bound to evoke comparisons to luciano or villalobos but its plain to hear that inspirescu has a truly distinct sound of his own in fact each of the four tracks here is different each evoking that rare feeling that you are listening to something genuinely new b1 is a slightly more uptempo track thats built around a warbling horn sample and time-stretched chattering voices its got the same shambolic almost goofy feel as fizheuer zieheuer albeit with a structure thats a little more conventional following up on 1 is perhaps the catchiest track of the four and yet another departure in style the percussion is almost disco influenced before a skewed and erratic bassline takes things forward to then comes the chorus : a woozy vocal hook drops in to give the track the feeling of warped pop finally as if the first three tracks werent enough inspirescu gives us reme a deep and grooving piece of house music thats the most classic sounding track on the ep and the closest thing to a peaktime record on this release smattering of psychedelic effects are layered over a bassline that almost sounds like a double bass and organic swinging drums ultimately youre left feeling that any one of these tracks alone on a 12 would be a pretty big deal s it is with four tracks that sound unlike almost any other artist its difficult to envisage many better releases than this in one thing is certain: were all going to be hearing a lot more about
where past releases on athens label have tended towards blissful deep house the labels latest is far murkier debut ep from berlin producer is closer to the dark muscular house of dvs1s mistress label than to the likes of vaib-r or miltiades fortunately this widening of purview turns out to be an excellent move is the highlight here its ahem drama stems from the tension between its elements: weary darkwave synths on one hand an upbeat soulful acapella ( i wont fade away ill be pushin on ) on the other results perfectly capture that sense of grim determination to push through a 5 am drug slump but its also bold and hooky enough to ensnare a sober crowd remaining three originals thrive on the contrast between extremely chunky percussion (the kicks in particular feel like a fist to the jaw) and some softening element or other whose heartstring-tugging chords couldve been lifted from the richard d james album is the best of the bunch but the other two are worth checking with its heartfelt monologue and s wonderfully anaesthetised chord work taken together they outline a stark and highly distinctive aesthetic an impressive feat in a debut release so impressive in fact that a remix from opal tapes golden boy patricia feels redundant
david kennedy has an affinity for experimental sound design which he folds into club music without batting an eyelid on s self-titled debut album however that tendency made for a record that sounded like the hessle udio man was a little lost inside his own head is his first release since then and while the music remains stripped-down as ever the energy and panache that make a good tune are back in full force each side is built on a typical foundation: a lopsided drum loop repeats until you start imagining subtle changes in its clockwork tick is the most dynamic percolating and bubbling with the introduction of a piano sample that kennedy finesses he finds small revelations in the twist of a filter knob highlighting his ear for repetition and decay (which irked sleeparchive by sampling elephant island without permission) sinks into a more cerebral and detailed soundscape this time spacey synths and trigger-happy drum programming bore forward with the single-minded determination of techno though still bounce with a playful skip its neither here nor there like most tracks and its excellent
s debut is only his second ep but it feels like the work of a scene stalwart as he showed on his debut skokie intruder the copenhagen-based frenchman has a canny ear for a sample the organ lick that roles through the title track sounds like something andr s would loop for hours bleached and out of focus as though seen through a heat haze it evokes memories of early evenings on european beaches preparing to party but not wanting to get up just yet elsewhere things push on a little later into the night theres a touch of mcde to the sonorous low-end in and both flicker with organs and drums that sound like theyve been salvaged from a charity shop bin the eps highlight is which could be a forgotten theo parrish cut it has a loping bassline that sounds like its being banged out by an upright bass player in a smoke-filled jazz club its a rump-shaking track with the same nebulous air found elsewhere on the ep giving it a sense of narcotic-induced oddness
thanks to the inclusion of plesso on tama sumos entry in ostguts panoramabar mix series later this month the previously modest profile of irelands lerosa looks set to increase considerably within the next few months as if that wasnt enough of a boost s latest offering sees him team up with donato dozzy an italian talent enjoying a similar surge following a string of consistently acclaimed deeper-than-deep releases for a solid eps worth of forward-thinking moody afterhours chuggers s output has typically been bent toward the deeper end of the techno spectrum and here both lerosa and dozzy push the labels aesthetic further choosing to take the speed down a notch and weave their respective styles together in four tracks delving as low as 100 bpm ( ) and reaching as high as 124 bpm ( ) usefully the snakes in question all live up to their taxonomic designations none more so than a suitably lithe crawler punctuated with loose bass stabs and flicking percussion after the misty (a dubbier cut luke hess fans might want to take note of) is the most dj-friendly choice here with a controlled tension marking out its obvious role as a stinging little set pacer things are rounded off with the subdued whose modulating synths and gentle piano refrains slither along slowly to eventually offset its own hypnosis-inducing acid wobble in the end lerosa and dozzys combined skills come together brilliantly to create a fresh and well-rounded exercise in deep techno experimentation with enough backbone to charm even the most exploratory listener
turkish producer has been one of the most impressive producers in the last few years whether it is his hypnotic red pilot or even his tracks under his mavi guise guvenen certainly knows how to hit the spot this ep on bedrock has been eagerly anticipated and it s clear to see why 4 new productions by a great producer on a label that is used to releasing quality has resulted in this that is broken up into two discs disc one on the a-side is opus 34 the track begins smoothly with some nice rattling drums and some humming atmospheric sounds in the background it builds nicely with hats soon becoming factor and then shortly after the main melodic tone starts to filter through providing the production with a great flow the track breakdown midway with beats more scattered and then some absolutely beautifully constructed string patterns it doesn t last long enough however as the beats soon start to build their way again as the track starts to build to peak time with the melodic tones deep subtle baseline and drums all working overtime a fantastic production on the flip is the very massive mass schizophrenia the track is deceptively slow and smooth at the onset as the track builds with changes in the drum pattern and a smooth swirling melody it continues to grow with the hats gaining in intensity as well as the harmonious sounds the production breaks down introducing a smooth baseline that intertwines with the swirling melody as the breakdown seems to build to introduce the beats again the production takes another twist this time a vocal effect echoes in time with a drum roll that makes way for a devastating arpeggiated baseline pure brilliance the track is now in overdrive with the baseline holding it all together this is meant for a sound system with power disc two firstly on disc two is the march it begins with some tribal drums and a simply melody the deep rumbling baseline soon gives the production energy and drive as it builds in quick time another melodic riff soon enters as some big driving synths also ride in the background of the production the drums have a quirky feel about them too which really compliments the atmospheric nature of this track the strings really make this track as it progresses while the tingling melodic line gives it a great edge as well another great production on the flip is seyo in blue it begins with a thunderous kick drum and a looped short stabbing synth some vocal effects soon make their presence as the drums also gain significance and start intensifying at a quick rate this track is another great example of the talent has at building a production with layers upon layers as he soon brings another cute trickle of melodic sounds and then some more dazzling string patterns the strings exit the track and let the production drive with some big drums but only for a short period as the strings come back in accompanied with a changing note baseline pattern this is pure melodic progressive at its best it s another great production by the turkish delights of it is not often that in an artist ep that you can honestly say that all tracks are superb this is one such rare instance all 4 productions hit the spot at one point in the arrangements and as such i demand that you give this ep a listen at the very least it reminds me of the days where progressive was uplifting and at its very best its not very often that i give a vinyl release 10 but this one deserves nothing but
the latest release from comes with a declaration that technos vanguard can be found in the east right now the berlin label recently put its money where its mouth is with a pair of eps from the russian producer vladimir dubyshkin and now its turning its attention to the balkans when you think of dance music and bulgaria one artist in particular may come to mind there is something of the much-loved kink in sofias and not just because theyre a live act the duos playful full-blooded hardware sound recalls their countryman at his darkest (the records press release mentions his technoid side-project cyrillic ) but kinks music is above all fun by contrast soundtrack the kind of weird aggressive headtrip it takes weeks to recover from the highlight in this regard is which opens the ep with a snarl its little more than a single noxious bass note spitting corrosive gunk over a pummelling kick drum (the ep was mixed by co-owner stefan goldmann so we have him to thank for the delicate balance between grot and dance floor punch ) filtered noise washes add intensity before the midpoint breakdown leaves a helter-skelter melody floating in uncomfortable silence the rest of the ep steadily dials down the mood is more tense than outright aggressive with a jelly-like bassline that adds oily funk to its squat groove is a bit too subdued but its worth listening in for the spooky pinprick synths
the past year has been prolific indeed for matthew dear under his moniker nd in the spirit of the imminent new year is a work of nostalgia harking back to the rawness of kisses it sounds great if youre a fan of those earlier tracks as theres little around like them but this nostalgia collides with a feeling of year-end fatigue ll of the same features are there: mix-filling white noise swirling acidic lead lines and unpolished abrasion that threatens to tear your scalp off or would do that is if it werent so lazy the thing is all of the many elements feel like token gestures and perhaps therein lies the most important difference the simple effectiveness of mouth to mouth which simply didnt need more than one hook is replaced by a rather uncharacteristic more is more philosophy like a rabble of squawking condor hatchlings vying for attention from their mother none of the overlaid riffs succeed in being particularly memorable lso lacking is his characteristic kick drum which even alone could drive a system with the motion of a freight train it would save things here but in its place we merely have a heavy plod that carries us through until the record tapers off and fizzles out the tradeoff between quality and quantity is well-known and recently dears been forsaking the former for the latter it would be a shame if this diminished his stellar reputation
we might still not be sure who exactly london collective are but that isnt going to stop them from already embarking on solo projects the first in a new series on their freshly-minted label is a lone wolf effort from lto whoever that is things dont sound all that different here from previous work: its an ep of weepy electronics slouching towards oblivion starts things off in earnest with a looping piano melody attacked by techstep creaks and unwieldy breaks hinting at the rest of the eps detached forlorn beauty the real attraction here is the stunning where a timestretched lagging breakbeat is smeared across a canvas of foghorns and distant trumpets held down by chimes and rumbling bass the whole thing has that distinctly autechre sheen of indifferent chrome scrambling emotion set inside malfunctioning computer music sounds operates on a similar plane playing with dense breakbeats and uncoiling any number of sounds around them creating something that alternates between hedging peace and hectic chaos the ep ends on a grand note with throbbing like akira yamaokas most frightening scores for the silent hill series before dissolving into beautiful suspended resolution dusts itself off before adopting a more civilized gait to brighter climes finishing off a four track ep that emotionally wrings the listener more than most albums
has said that he communicates ideas with his music but only inferred ideas not explicitly explained ones he was talking about the way he uses his voice delivering simple but suggestive phrases in evocative husky tones but this focus on the inferred extends to other aspects of his music its there in instrumental side project road hog where ideas about race freedom and american identity flicker like shadows across serene deep house compositions and it might have been key to his breakout success too quietly published on lesser-known mix site blowing p workshop 2013s 100 galcher racked up hundreds of thousands of streams and inspired cult-like adoration maybe that was precisely because of the things it left unsaid: a promomix of fleeting tracks and scrappy interludes it hinted at a rich musical world while leaving plenty to the imagination lustwerk has since struggled to live up to our imagined version of him not that his music has got worse; it hasnt changed much at all which is kind of the problem road hogs bumping house aesthetic has remained attractive and mostly static across three years and four releases nder the galcher name only 2013s tape 22 convincingly built on the mixs promise others were cagey (2014s nu day ep for tsuba) or belated (two eps committing 100 galcher tracks to vinyl didnt appear until 2015) coming four years after his dazzling debut theres not much on that we havent already heard but once youve set those sky-high expectations to one side its nice to hear it all again re are the gnomic lyrics in honeyed spoken word ( s i got a red rose / and ima throw it in the trash could be the 21st century analogue of for sale: baby shoes never worn ) some tracks drift into road hogs themes and sounds such as im drivers with its pensive chords and late-entry vocals and the instrumental which is lost in moody cruise control its smooth forward motion slowly lapsing into stasis res also a decent batch of vocal house tracks in the classic galcher mould each combining louche house drums with cloudlike pads buried funk low-end and those trademark vocals and are energetic but light; s cushioned slouch is sleepier all three couldve held their own on 100 galcher yre counterbalanced by a couple of mild surprises sounds like a galcher beat in chaotic meltdown and beatdown closer gets mileage out of ramshackle percussion and lithe live bass latter is the albums best track and also symbolic of the whole galcher as is often the case finds himself trapped in a recursive life of leisure: need a cold drink so i made one / all i do is play the same old game son maybe those endless glimmering vistas hinted at in his music are actually a closed loop and maybe thats not such a bad thing after all
despite the two-year gap the latest ep from barcelonas pretty much picks up where love is a drug their 2012 release on get physical left off an already anticipated proposition is made all the more so by an excellent carl remix moves on a bass synth riff that evokes any number of classic kompakt cuts jaw (of dop) delivers the titular lyric with a sleepy drawl that feels at odds with its message as if murmured by someone whod actually been wild several hours earlier s remix is predictably essential it rumbles into high gear quickly through an irresistible combo of bass and twinkling synths incorporating elements of the vocal as it goes the masomenos remix is the paciest offering on the package scattering distorted vocal fragments across a landscape of murky bass and hydraulic pads closer is more meditative still it has skittering muted percussion and a radar bleep-like vocal loop while a suave spoken-word vocal completes a trippy brew
while people across the world took to the streets to protest against the recent conflict in iraq it seems evil 9 were holed up in a studio having their own subtle dig at the war not fighters is a far cry from the unwashed anti-war free love sentiment of woodstock but has a vibe all of its own nother distinctive and original-sounding track from evil 9 aka pat pardy and tom eaufoy made all the more desirable a wall-shaking remix from bottom-end freak lim it carries on where cakehole left off this time taking things up a notch yet retaining the deep gurn-inducing breaks that youd expect tune that should prove popular across the board thanks to a dirty driving original and even filthier remix - the only fighting during this record will be to get on the dance floor
it seemed like for a while there drum bass was well on its way to a critical revival with the advent of autonomic and the feeling that new and interesting things could still happen at 170 beats per minute mammoth mosaic compilation last year showed the impressive breadth of the new movement but since then autonomic stalwarts instra:mental have gone electro consequence went weird asc is tackling every tempo he can and dbridge himself has gone oddly quiet following consequences fantastic but difficult test dream is drum bass legend loxys album-length collaboration with finnish producer resound and it frustratingly lacks the experimental spirit of recent exit efforts pertaining to loxys considerable pedigree the production on is meticulous exact the work of an expert: wide open and expansive in that paranoid film noir way that defines some of the best 00s drum bass presents a potent strain of the dark stuff sure to whet the appetites of hooded smoked-up ravers the sound design aspect of the album wows early with the near beatless which hints at a monstrous lfo drop without ever actually quite getting there floating on pins and needles and setting up the next track to be an enormous burst of relief which never really comes instead presents a perfunctory roller with all the power of a light rail train locked into a simplistic path that feels devoid of momentum or even all that much motion in the first place instead the devils hidden in the deepest details fetid post-industrial backdrops of strange effects careful reverb and dread-inducing tones lead single gives a good indication of the albums strengths making something that sounds nasty and threatening without resorting to jump-up frat party devices but it still feels entirely predictable even the albums careful soundscapes begin to wear over the course of the album: you can throw in all the sharp little drum fills you want on tracks like but they still sound like cookie-cutter late-period drum bass fare updated with a slightly broader outlook on the kind of sounds that can be acceptably incorporated (a welcome linger from autonomics brief reign): youve heard it all before and a shiny new coat of gloss can only entertain for so long the albums closing moments bring a glint of hope a fantastic downtempo rework of the duos from the mosaic compilation: everything feels liquid and impermanent a brilliant sense of freeform atmosphere accented by the slippery offbeat drums it takes what was a relatively standard (but lush) track and turns into something boldly experimental but not alienating its too bad you cant say the same for the rest of the album will likely be gobbled up by scene hardliners but its familiarity factor and relative lack of adventure feels like a step backward for one of modern drum basss most consistently exciting labels
for those of you that go clubbing on a regular basis and have heard some of the more on the ball disc jockeys provide you with quality house tunes - you definitely would have experienced this tune before the original was produced by goldtrix and released in january of 2002 with andrea brown providing the vocals - a combination that set the charts alight these remixes however come from matrix who is also one half of the goldtrix alias and has over the year s earned massive respect in the drum n bass production world the new revised deep mix of it s love (trippin ) features the great distinctive vocal that like the original instantly helps this release climb above many others joint with its solid thumping bass line and deep dark sounds this is a fine club tune and has already been dropped by many of the world s best on both the house and dnb genre s alike the extended mix has been cleverly done so that at one speed it is a great house track and jacked up a few notches it becomes a solid drum n bass type this mix of trippin does as you would expect from the title and really draws out the vocal and slowing the track down somewhat giving it a much more building feel rather than what the deep mix does on the flip side
following months behind dle033 is s second album of his recent dle hands lp was basically a slow murky beat tape but this full-length for returns to the british producers boldly patient and deeply textured techno cross nine tracks karmil errs on the side of simplicity everything here is made of only the most essential elements with little in the way of ornamentation when karmil lands on a sound he likes a loop a texture a pattern an accidental rhythm he seems to want only to sink deeper into it s a result is distinctly meditative often featuring just one idea that blurs in and out of focus until it fades away early on m is the most hypnotic and spacious example of this utilizing a loop of filtered chords foggy tape noise and a pulsing low-end pattern the five-minute taps into another simple loop of dubby chords as does for its gripping six minutes near s end downshifts the momentum with a light throb of warbled pads that stretches to almost nine minutes s on his past albums (especially his debut lp for ---- ) karmils affinity for stripped-down composition seemed to come from an unshakable confidence in his ideas knowing what he wanted to say with each track and executing it as directly as possible large part of what makes these efficient arrangements successful is how the producer crafts texture around his source material with tape processing and gentle manipulation ts easy to hear how much time was invested the individual sounds feel obsessed over each element sounding like its been bounced back and forth between tape decks the process gives the music marbled layers of sonic degradation all the pops clicks and incidentals that result from being continually transferred through tape plays to the strength of karmils tones only hinting at his presence as a conductor he fades elements in and out like on which waits until its closing minutes to introduce the rhythms low-end and gradually tweaks delays and filters to bury sounds under the fog though karmil has dabbled in dance floor material for b s and studio barnhus among others sits on the fringe of club music what rhythms there are take the form of slow-thudding kicks or splintered hi-hats and snares all cloaked in swaths of noise karmil stays focused on coaxing emotional depth from his tape-centric production process dle033 was an engaging side-step into experimentation is a prudent step forward
any release from grandcentral records seems to kick some ass when given some airplay whether it be at the club on the radio or just in the comfort of the lounge room s releases are quite nice heard on a set of headphones with nothing better to do than sit back and read a book his last outing was 1999 s laidback/chillout/hiphop/triphop classic cold water music with the title track becoming a dancefloor anthem at many breaks clubs/events after 3 years we are treated to his latest release a picture of somewhere in western australia graces the front cover mr turner must really think highly of us down here especially given some good reviews of his performance at vibes last year either that or he must think wa is a really chilled out place and to have it on the front cover is perfect for a chillout album seems to pick some really obscure sample/beat for the intro tracks to his album and s intro is no different syncopated piano playing all alone then the drum beat kicks in showing no sign of being any less syncopated great concentration is all lost when trying to achieve the right mood for listening to this album kate rogers makes another guest appearance on the girl who fell through the ice what better way to start the album than by having a female lull you into unconsciousness with her voice and the strings in the background don t help much either what i m trying to say is this is an awesome track needs to be heard and the beat could not have confused me any further is this a hip-hop track or what what do people do all day if this song were something to go by then we d be having sex as this is a sexy track it has a bit of a st germain feel to it no restriction featuring souls of mischief the last time i heard these fellas was on quannum spectrum grandcentral seem to have found a niche with the us hip-hop stars with funky fresh few with afu ra only child and kriminul and rae christian teaming up with the pharcyde this track sounds very similar to the latter team up with it s xylophone and funky drum beat fall break what do students get up to during their fall break party and get drunk this track really sounds like a violinist getting drunk and melancholy on top of a beat so phat it was probably pulled off some battle breaks lp you d think it was a chillout track but then the hiphop sample just proves you wrong this is hiphop production taken to the next level baby guimar getting quite upbeat for this track decides to pull off samba style and it seems to work well this one features sneaky from fingathing on bass who works wonders on the lower end of the sound spectrum but the most appealing part is the uptempo beat accompanied by a cheeky sax line good disease featuring stephen jones going a little slower on this track we hear a singer getting all falsetto with his voice on a track that sounds quite groovy and jazzy it could make an impression either in the background on the headphones or played live the omen featuring diamond d diamond d who is able to both produce a good hip hop track and kick some lyrical flow sometimes at the same time represents well on this track the low end bass line with the orchestral stabs seem to suit his rhyme flow quite well not too fast not too slow linctus getting quite chilled and atmospheric this is more like the we all know a lazy trumpet sample just makes you want to kick back and the strings in the background just help you create that ambient feel viper a return to the spy theme which the propellerheads made so popular back in 97 this track is upbeat with a phat beat and has those crazy horn stabs we ve come to expect from a spy theme (during the action of course) a twilight zone folk rock in a chillout album this one sounds a little strange to these ears however it shows that is not only decent at producing a trip hop number but also adept at pretty much anything he adds his magic to it s another vocal track with some uncredited singer from a seaside town this one is a better track than the previous one piano line which sounds like satie and yet again seems to sample another sax line for use in his track another atmospheric track which allows your mind to float s title tracks seem to be dark and moody and this one is no different has a quite scary movie feel to it with a sample of a horror movie being the main part of the song the flute sample takes it further into horror/suspense movie territory seems to want to take hip hop into a new level as he explores the drum beats and uses them in different contexts if you re a fan of the laidback leftfield hip hop style like the avalanches dj shadow automator ninjatune rae christian and other grandcentral recording artists then this is one album you should get in your selection grandcentral artists seem to get better with every release they put out personally i found rae christian s sleepwalking a little better than northern sulphuric soul creative vibes have outdone themselves again with another fine release from a label (grandcentral) which seems to suit their style a lot better than their previous distributor
hamburg-based though relatively new to the game has in recent years established himself as one of the very finest purveyors of uncluttered neatly poised deep house at their finest his productions overflow with imagination wringing invention from simple materials in a way which is both unobtrusive and deeply absorbing raus release schedule has been well-populated for a few years now and crowns a productive year with singles for mule musiq and thema an unashamedly thumping number is the disappointment its forthright chords and crisp sheets of hi-hats not holding many surprises elsewhere though rau is on finer form the beautifully airy title track centred around a gorgeous string and keys loop manages to be both light-footed and propulsive at first were in languid territory but the intensity climbs quickly towards the midpoint splashy hats and a subtly funky guitar vamp pushing the thing along meanwhile is an exquisite eyes-down affair its melancholic keyboard line offset with a dextrous bassline and the delicate instability of its percussive loop rau ever the stickler for detail implants soft chirruping synth details and snatches of melody in the background as if evoking the dawn chorus of some synthetic woodland rounding off the package lerosa reworks in a live jam style upping the intensity in the process a bashy drum palette and bowel-quaking bassline make it surefire dance floor material though the dreamy dissociative melodics that strafe the stereo field in the latter half might give dancers pause for thought impressively we reach a jacking plateau without ever quite losing the originals thoughtful qualities perhaps because that central keyboard loop is retained for almost the entire track hovering teasingly on the edge of earshot

danilo plessow may be best known for the raw cuts sound he has pursued on his own mcde imprint but his deeper work under the name is just as worthy of consideration its a scrubbed-up version of the gritty underground quality vibe popularized by jus-ed and others a slowed-down house sound that revels in analogue synths in the same way that lawrence and efdemin have done for years now its been mighty popular over the past few months and the early adopters outside of the core scene are just now swooping in to grab up the mightiest of its talents plessow included thats why youll see unlikely labels like 20:20 vision home to crazy p the youngsters and mark broom to name a few offering up 12-inches plessows first for the label leads off with a patient plodder that features a wordless moaning of the titular lonely man like all of plessows slo-mo house work it builds smoothly as though every element was simply waiting in the wings to make its appearance at the proper moment and after it finishes up descends silently into the ether frontin arrives with more purpose a charming four-note riff in tow that pulses as much as it delivers melody soul sample repeats for much of the track an echo of plessows raw cuts eps but the focus here is on warmth not spontaneous loops feels the same way with an organ riff cutting across to offer up some variety but its not quite as smooth as its predecessors and suffers in comparison a mediocre ending to an otherwise strong outing on a new label
starting out on the fringes of uk funky bedfords has trodden an unusual path hints at his transformation were there as early as 2011 in the sampha-featuring on your own 2013s distance ep took things further intercutting silvas aggy drum tracks with attempts at pop crossover they werent half-bad attempts either closer to samphas young turks crew than the ill-advised major label dalliances of fellow funky innovators ill blu since then silva has kept both plates spinning: last years mabel threw the spotlight on the producers own voice (and that of banks for whom he has produced) and finds him barrelling back onto the dance floor unfortunately he seems to have lost his bite somewhere along the way the title track is the best of the lot and the closest to silvas past glories its engine-oil bassline and frenetic breakbeats should be sufficient to send the red stripe cans flying elsewhere silva tries out some new ideas with limited success dribbles juicy synth chords enticingly over an electro beat but never quite goes anywhere as the title suggests is a lean drum machine workout its syncopated rhythms and crisp snare tattoos would be entertaining enough had the swamp 81 crew not pre-empted them by a few years
sounds like a culoe de song done by a frenchman which is to say its a pretty reasonable facsimile but lacks the je ne sais deep of the young south frican the lyon-based dj/producer has always had a way with melody though and the tune delivers in that respect: s synth pulses and pulses until it cant pulse anymore without a lithe piano line and yearning strings comes through when things break down leaving only a beat and a violin solo that turns into a mass of them all quivering in anticipation of the return of the bass clearly doesnt shy away from the big moment ut he also doesnt shy away from making the big moment really weird is a prime example utilizing the talents of scalde a singer whose exceptional range fooled an r reviewer into believing he was a she once upon a time the unconventional vocals are complemented by a soaring violin dessicated horns and s typically progressive rhythmic bounce good luck finding a break to comfortably mix out of this one though: has so many things he needs to do with all of these elements that he barely leaves you time at the end to figure out a way to get anywhere else
dusk and blackdowns closed out 2012 with beneaths storming illusions and they ring in with the debut ep from these two producers alongside visionist form the young triumvirate at the forefront of a sound blackdown has provisionally titled dark 130 s a style whose sounds windswept pads gloomy melodies brooding sub weight can be traced back to the early fwd and dmz days nudged down a few bpm and spliced with the rhythmic dna of grime and uk funky this tried and true palette proves to be fertile ground for new mutations as it stands s profile is largely non-existent; on the strength of these four tracks concise and original as they are that ought to change and s halftime beats roll forth with the poised asymmetry of the finest grime leaden but somehow agile the latters slower tempo affects the rhythmic flow but what it loses in groove it makes up for in sheer weight of atmosphere displays a subtle uk house skip but its growling bass throbs are a distant cousin of youngstars seminal grime track pulse x saves his best til last in a devilishly abstracted halftime beat whose meaty grime-esque orchestral samples are slowed and stretched until they take on an oddly mournful quality on the surface this music may seem too slow and spacious to work in the dance but just as with early dubstep s carefully constructed rhythms contain a subtle double-time undertow impelling your body to fill in the gaps

takes in everything from fm soft rock to the fried psychedelia of syd barrett crafting music whose reference points are familiar yet hard to pin down this makes the kiwi singer one of the more unlikely signings to erol alkans label his sound hasnt changed all that much since 0 s lphin love as on that record wobbly ad-ish guitars provide an unstable structure for his vocals to reverberate around in f it wasnt so slathered in effects could be a charming folk album nstead its so ephemeral that its almost frail sharing some ideas with the goofier end of psych-rock most of the songs on are based on bluesy guitar riffs that get across more emotion than the bizarre vocals mockasin sounds like hes puffing on helium shooting up into an inhuman register as if he cant control his own pitch when hes singing love songs like the title track or the touching theres a sense that hes intentionally defying expectations just when you think hes got a killer hook going ( shy ) it gets muddled by mumbling or tonal weirdness m basically sounds like a warbly off-cut from an old ing stones bootleg mushmouth lyrics and all s second half is taken up by the five-part ts r suite an all-consuming black hole that smothers whatever sluggish momentum might have existed before it and makes the rest of the album seem far more conventional than it actually is by the time the weepy riff of is leading us back into relative normalcy it sounds like a pop song but its not pop is something that mockasin likes to imagine rather than create and thats exactly what he does here is a collection of half-finished songs that force you to fill in the blanks ts just as frustrating and occasionally enlightening as that sounds
lorenzo dangelo and go back a long way the rome producer has recorded almost exclusively for the glasgow label and wireblock one of the now defunct labels was spawned from over the past decade hes also played for them on many occasions including one event at paisleys club 69 many years ago that cofounder jackmaster still says was the best set of his life many of the tracks on the three strange days eps so far have included the word acid in their titles which tells you plenty about the releases generally fevered atmospheres in fact grn-hf has a dreamy quality largely thanks to its wafting foreground horn melody elastic bass and keen percussion usher it back to the floor as a potential set closer but its a notably gentle member of the strange days series feels more familiar both in terms of its title and its dark mood even after several minutes of repetitious bounding acid though dangelo still has a trick up his sleeve a suddenly dominant arc of shining pads to remind us who were dealing with here
cuba computers team up with derek conyer whose soulful vocals appear in this impressive and gracious doublepack with the likes of danny tenaglia danny howells and eric morillo going crazy over its class have sure hit the spot once more the original is a delicious vocal number with beautiful strings while the seriously groovy beat makes you get down under their laid moniker we see it go funky but keeping it on the tougher edge chus and ceballos lineup to put their spin on things with their iberican vocal and dub mixes the tribal twist these guys produce here is fabulous the vocal mix goes large into a big houser as the vocal swirls around its filtered environment
though it holds only alternate takes of the same track s three cuts are fairly different s original is bright and quirky progressing via a whirling arp it bobs and lurches like a high-speed carousel with a raft of effects ensuring the ride keeps moving sandwell s remix is similarly entrancing the tracks immediate surface seems depressingly static fa aded as it is with limping defeated machine cycles concentrate hard enough however and the kick drums microscopic tweaking becomes apparent as do the ghostly screeches in the back its more implied sensation than tangible feeling truly visceral despite the absence of pummeling drums or euphoric chords there is one niggle though bout 40 seconds from the tracks conclusion an insistent twanging synth enters the mix its impact amplified after so many minutes of mind games it changes the groove completely hinting at loftier heights just as quickly as it appeared however it vanishes into the ether and everything else fades prematurely to silence with it its like being ushered out of the movie theatre right before the ending s remix is less destructive heavily blurring essers hyperactive arp rather than removing it altogether or more accurately stretching and pitching as the title instructs while sandwells version feels dusty and lifeless this one is warm and aqueous swaddled with bulbous chords and gentle splashing hi-hats even its sharper portions rapid bursts of 808 claps and snares feel benign when submerged in such masses of delay and thrumming ambience
anyone who runs a vinyl only label these days needs to and im sorry to use the marketing term add value vinyl is now produced in ever smaller batches or presented in fancy packaging exaggerating its tactility firecracker however took it to the point of ridiculousness with the original came presented in a fabric bag designed and made in the 80s by italian aestheticist ettore sottsass and was pressed on a run of 46 it also cost about 50 fortunately the re release sees a more reasonable approach you can now buy a standard 10 inch albeit with a nice sleeve of course all this talk of formats would be hot air if the music wasnt any good but untyled is a particularly great slice of moody deep house the lead track mixes 80s boogie cowbells with myriad swirling synthesisers that bring to mind both mike banks and herbie hancock it all ticks over pleasantly enough until an m1 type bassline hits bringing with it a huge whoosh of euphoria the sum is that rare thing a record thats both musically interesting and has the ability to make people dance next up is remix of which first appeared on firecrackers equally strong schevchenko imprint the track is a detroit indebted synth work out and you can clearly hear influences such as galaxy ii galaxy rounds out the package a neoclassical organ experiment that barely lasts more than a minute

miles mitchell is a resident at boxed a london party thats also home to logos slackk and oil gang and the gathering partly credited with fomenting the recent wave of experimental grime like his counterparts hes a traditional grime lover who isnt afraid to take the foundations of the genre and build new structures and his approach might just be the most accessible of all four his career launched in earnest around the same time as butterz and that labels colourful synth doodles might be a better comparison than the deconstructionist grime of his peers all four tracks on released on his own gobstopper label are touched with that chintzy neon sound but use it in entirely different ways bowsers with its whirring 8-bit arpeggios sounds like early eprom with added aggression as heavy kicks match the bassline almost note-for-note and reveals mitchells reflective side stripping down what could otherwise be a big-room dubstep track into a haunting ballad epic yelps and all most boxed-sounding thing here is a track frosted by southern rap synths while one single drum pounds through the still ambience finally on mitchell takes on night slugs-style stutter with camera flashes and spastic percussion each track borrows an idea from somewhere else but mitchell synthesizes them well this ep should go some way to establishing his name alongside his peers
always want to be dismissive of this kind of stuff the bedroom dubstep-etc beloved of indie crossover dreams college radio nu- dm until put it on again half of this four-song ep is already familiar if you know crooks and lovers but they help make give the ep a coherency: and act as a kind of terra firma for the two other tracks vivid recastings of songs from the first ep (previewed on s excellent ra podcast) fe ures a bassline th sounds like it was scored by following the movements of a super mario brothers videogame it flips loop-de-loops darts wows and bobs even when its rel ively quiet for much of the middle even before a short breakdown the bass keeps you on your toes in anticip ion of it going off again and its cartooniness makes a nice pair with all the videogame and scr ch noises as well as the rel ively pacific synth pads the version of here recorded berghain billows big in thanks to cloudy echo on the trebly stammering vocal snippets and to fuzzy guitar chords and gong samples cant say how much of it was planned and how much was done on the fly but it was clearly the right amount of each
not exactly a beginners guide to house music the catalogue of the bergen-based imprint is puzzlingly fascinating since 2004 the label run by peter natol mitterer and stefan mitterer has released an impressive amount of off-the-beaten-track club sounds wandering through these norwegian woods can be a most rewarding trip: you will come across the misty italo/detroit styles of skatebard get carried away in the sonic maelstrom of elder stateman bjorn torske or venture upon the stripped-down house territory of don papa here we have providing with a self-titled track a bela lugosi-styled voice rising from an old-school chicago grave to deliver his message of insanity over a brooding siren-and-string-epic equally haunted by eerie vocal snippets are tle and while the former leans towards an italo vibe the latter straddles in a distorted balearic mood not much is known about the origin of the sex tags crew discloses this much: its probably one of the most obscure vocal techno tracks from the norwegian post-millennium era obviously because it hasnt been released yet but more because nobody else would have ever released it if it werent for us we dont select these styles we live these styles word to that

simian mobile discos kooky culinary tour on which theyve been joined by a rotating menu of producers reaches the pudding course so far their gastronomic expedition has inspired tracks named after roasted booze-soaked songbirds maggot-infested sardinian cheese and fermented herring detroit grand pubahs sandwiches it aint (a japanese dessert made with bee or wasp larvae ) finds smd hooking up with roman fl gel for a spot of sprawling atmospheric minimal rather than opting for a linear groove blips and beeps build with tantalizing intensity the tracks title is reflected in the waspish buzz that meanders through it its elegant analogue house cut with a pinch of malevolence the first of two takes on izizukuri (thats sashimi prepared with live fish) is a bouncing tech workout constructed from pulsing synths and groaning bass the lt mix takes the original and passes it through a dub techno filter dotting it with flecks of quavering bass to create immersive head music
ntheas name is popping up all over the place at the moment her employment at trendy london record store phonica (hectors famed stomping ground) is probably in part to thank for that but its also her move into the production arena as well this particular record has been appearing in various charts for the last couple of months (three times in her own no less) and sees her team up with lex celler to form a partnership the hypesters are calling houses hottest new talents on this evidence though the jury is still out cyclical claps and whirs clatter from the off the kick coming a few seconds later to add cursory depth snippets of vocodered vocals litter the track throughout and thats about it really very little else happens once the tech-house vibe has too quickly been established on remix duty is another producer currently garnering props left right and centre: frenchman dyed soundorom he steals the show with less jack and greater restraint he shows that subtle placement and a more sparing use of the vocal snippets can result in a nuanced track which could well ignite the odd dance floor or two tech-house seems to be a returning fad at the moment thing is it sounds no further advanced than where we left it so on this evidence it seems a pointless revival: lets hope im wrong
somewhere even as you read this there is a party happening impossibly stylish and beautiful people are sipping champagne talking about their incredibly sophisticated lifestyles at any moment the party may slide into hedonistic excess as easily as sliding into a bed with silk sheets although rest assured that even this will be gracefully and artfully done sadly us mere mortals will never go to a party like this but with this double cd we at least get to hear the soundtrack is a collaboration between steve bug s dessous label and photographer sacha dean biyan in-demand fashion photographer biyan contacted bug to contribute music for his eccentris website and it turns out the stylish sexy house of dessous was the perfect partner for biyan s photographic explorations of beauty (which tend to feature scantily-clad gorgeous women in sometimes suggestive poses) the success of the project encouraged bug and biyan to work together again in a time of digital downloads reminds us of the importance of packaging not as advertising but as something that enhances the music evoking a mood and creating an experience that involves the listener the release features a thirty-six page booklet of biyan s photography and an uncompressed version of the eccentris website enabling you to experience biyan and bug s first collaboration in all its lush audiovisual glory biyan s images are much like the party at the start of this review: sensual suggestive and glamorous the packaging ably sets the scene for the deep sexy house promised on the cd cover the first disc a collection of ten tracks compiled by steve bug is clearly the better of the two opening with steve barnes gently flowing remix of nathan fake s coheed bug treats us to an impeccably selected and wonderfully sequenced collection of smooth and deep downtempo house pulsing basslines and rhythms rock you from side to side sometimes becoming jazzy and funky (such as on jake childs pure ) while gliding synths take you softly by the hand and lead you forward the cd is filled with gems but the highlight is perhaps future beat alliance s remix of chateau flight s 1973 a smooth chocolate treat with a deliciously sweet achingly nostalgic centre as the cover promises this is indeed a sexy collection but it doesn t attempt to have its way with you dirty dancing style; instead it gently caresses you easing you into plush cushions with a glass of champagne in hand whispering soft promises into your ears if the first cd softly nibbled your earlobes on the sofa the second pulls you to your feet and tells you it s time to dance the party has begun at the controls are me mixing twelve tracks that sustain the sensual mood established by bug and the mixing is solid but fails to build any sort of narrative; tracks slide neatly into place one after the other but don t build anywhere it ll do just fine playing in the background at a party but it won t engage and involve your partygoers like the best mixes do from the photographs to the music skin is in offers us a dream of sophistication and glamour half naked supermodels aren t necessary at your next party just this cd
moving melodic moody double deep house is the stock-in-trade of the duo of alfie granger-howell and nick harriman and on this surprising 12-inch for above and beyonds they deliver just that as with their techier solarity alter-ego theres an impressive show of craftsmanship here has already vied for a pete tong essential new tune accolade; strapping the emotional pull of prog trance to rhodes piano of the mj cole variety and then tying it all together with hybrid-style strings may not sound workable but the results are nigh-on irresistible a complex snaking bristolian house bassline haunts the bouncy but scratch away at it and emotive piano phrasings and synth washes are carried along in its undertow the deepest is left to the last theres something of the witchiness about the way darkened synths stabs and clipped percussion cleave away at the minimal-style slo-mo rhythm of it brings down the curtain on a highly polished ep of grown-up dance floor electronica
oliver ho has been making dance music with an experimental bent for over ten years now he started out making harder techno with doses of tribal house and dark abstract noise sprinkled in between but his new moniker focuses more on the minimal side of the dancefloor most recently has caught a bit of attention with his excellent remix of szenario s pleaseasy the title track is a hypnotic monster made for the dancefloor effective in its simplicity it revolves around three main components: a massive resonating bass which will rattle your insides shaking percussion and sinister and darkly manic bleeps is huge in its own right but it would also work extremely well building into the climactic parts of any set the two mixes of s on the b side are really good tunes too but where the simplicity of works a treat and overwhelms you these two ultimately seem a bit repetitive and don t quite boil over dark twisted with manic synth sounds piano chords and disturbing vocals to boot to say they create atmosphere is an understatement steve s use of hi-hats on his mix gives it a more funky groove while the head mix is a bit more acid-driven pensive and edgy neither mix will rock the dance floor but may work during the more introspective calmer moments of a set oh and the baby sample is just plain creepy has been going from strength to strength recently s really does deserve its place as only a b side but it is which makes the e p upon first listen it seems wholly understated yet somehow it works a treat highly recommended
despite having a small catalogue has been responsible for some of the finest techno of recent years the electromagnetic radiation series reinvigorated the often-staid dub techno sound while silhouette is among the most menacing techno records never to have come from the berghain stable therefore it is fair to say that whenever niels luinenburg releases a new record the pressure is on thankfully decorum has enough ingenuity as well as controlled brute force simmering just beneath its surface to make it a worthy addition to luinenburgs discography that said the acid licks on is too similar to the laddish end of london tech house from the 00s for comfort but thankfully luinenburg soon compensates deploying an industrial sounding bassline that stomps its ownership all over the arrangement there are parallels to another sound on but its more positive one this time as luinenburg mines the same abstract ambient path as norwegian producer biosphere with even the same sonar blips in the outro after its time to get down to business: ones and are in the mould of silhouette but even more brutal and functional with the former copper-fastening abstract sounds and stark tones to a utilitarian rhythm and the latter track featuring hammering metallic drums soldered to granite weight beats despite a slightly iffy start decorum is another resounding endorsement for one of technos most talented new artists
the is made up of blake potter tony mugavaro geoff hasslegrove and corey spengler who originate from the usa reach featuring reagan jones on vocals appears on james zabiela s renaissance compilation while little shaker boys has seen big support from danny tenaglia chris kai and the low end specialists reach takes a journey into the trippy breaks arena simple laid back beats are used as the basis for a plethora of bleeps sounds ticks and grinds that constantly fill the senses though keeping an underlying rhythm a great moody vocal is used in an early breakdown with washed out synths and quirky melodies squelches and acid effects are just a small number of elements that you can pick up throughout this track the vocal flows gorgeously along with the beat but it s the breakdowns that really adds the epic feel further on a moody synth melody takes centre stage and is very emotive and original awesome track taking on a tribal approach little shaker boys comes out with deep grooves and dirty drums the dark vocal is used to great effect here and gels with the beat adding a tough edge a haunting guitar sample is given a bit of treatment and sounds almost like a bird wailing really cementing the sound of the track while strictly putting itself into a dark clubbing environment devastating to the say the least a totally overwhelming package from tao here both tracks give you two totally different styles and really showcases the talents from this bunch of guys
this persona label showcase finds continuing to explore the divide between dancefloor stomp and domestic pleasantries a location he claimed as his own back on his 1999 expedition stabiles while that collection and last years grounded in existence kept things anaesthetised at the head-nod level personas progress seems more geared towards getting off the couch reflecting the labels move from boston to berlin walkers own productions have shown his considerable skill at straddling this fence: occasionally raucous but often restrained sleek and dark his tracks are shaded with requisite dabs of reverb and fuelled by sparse but propulsive basslines opener ten years of anger fits the mould beautifully everything clicking along with the steady glide of an electric train marco tonni as touane shimmies in next with esitazione which moves from smooth sensuality into a sweaty funk of hard drums mechanised female gasps and clinking chinese massage balls by walkers crabgrass vs monkeygrass these dizzying peaks have been flattened the buzzsaws turn into twee guitars and were back on our seats gustavo lamas convoca keeps the view hazy with pop crackle and click percussion recalling the sweetness of idm pretty-boys at city centre office touanes es tut mir leid is further misleading incorporating whines whale song and mbv distortion before a softened acid squelch threatens to up the ante slightly here lies the problem: walker has assembled his leading lights in a collection that is neither down-tempo enjoyment nor floor-filling excitement but rather a disorienting blend of the two at best walker can make music as downright lush as consumed-era plastikman piecemeal dub components offsetting precise click glitch and thud and his comrades here reveal moments of equal promise gregory shiffs subway flood for instance is infectious dancefloor skiffle shards of grit dancing from left to right and the percussion of touanes bassic seems to emanate through closed doors leaping out with a geeky but delicious melody youll be humming by the discs end walkers penultimate elevator dream a beautiful combination of restrained pings and tics slows things down before touane finishes with a jig to the chimes and bells of an old swiss clock walkers digital mixing adds some sense: cuts bleed into one another with nary a rugged contrast in sight but throughout theres an ongoing feeling of lack tracks are frequently cluttered with glitch whirr and bang but never allowed to growl and distort into the red track two is the highlight and then its an uneven to and fro to the finish thats often interesting but never exhilarating
recent string of impressive 12-inch offerings from the likes of ovill murmur vdub and most notably quantec have furnished london-based imprint meanwhile with an enviable reputation for top notch dub house and techno this their 15th release sees that trajectory not just maintained but extended; impressive stuff considering the culprit is all but unknown is a sombre piece of pitched down dub techno infused with a heavy dosage of ambient electronica (delsins 154 springs to mind) and just a smidgeon of laid-back house underpinned by a bright thumping kick which very nearly overwhelms the more fragile elements around it the track successfully steers clear of the kind of swampy post- c aesthetics so abundant right now coasting along at a moderate 120 pms all sullen pads washed-out synths and distant static its a resolutely downbeat affair laced with a kind of hazy melancholy and suitable only for the mellowest of dancefloors if any those itching to pull shapes neednt worry though: -side a shatteringly bleak idm-inflected electro lullaby successfully marries the frosty ambience of utechre-era uk techno with the bittersweet melodic palette of gerard hansons e r p output and in rollicking fashion propelled by a bouncy ur-friendly electrobreak its an exhilarating exercise in sustained emotion steadily building over the course of its seven minute duration aching squalls of synth intermittently staining a bed of wheezy gasps and twinkling bells before gracefully unfolding into a quietly crushing beatless finale dreamy and dynamic in equal measure its an almost perfect closing number fit for any dj capable (with what precedes) of doing it justice

the house-leaning sublabel of dvs1s hush imprint hasnt received anything less than a 4 from us for the first listen or three to the labels latest ep thought mistress had finally hit a dip if not in quality exactly than in the extensibility of its aesthetic the label isnt in the banger business but jacques four-tracker his first under his own name since 2005 burrows further into atmosphere than their previous releases had dared go with a bit more time (and the opportunity to hear the pressure it created on a dance floor) revealed itself as another excellent ep that continues mistresss impressive run isnt much more than a disco-y beat loop rhodes and sighs but like so much of the ep the pleasure is in the details: those tinny guitar licks that bit of hand-drumming the open hi-hats that cut like japanese steel ts dark but in retrospect its the eps moment of levity the rest is starker and more claustrophobic is less funky than lurching with little piano twinkles and woozy pads reinforcing its seasick vibe the flipside tracks and rattle and bang with bite that feels closer to techno than the house mistress is theoretically focussed on that ambiguity of form coupled with the subtlety of the production is what ultimately makes an alluring release on an already standout label
make no mistake: this is a big single and one that must be heard whether you poison is minimal techno dubstep breaks or just the twilight edge of new music ricardo villalobos remix of shackelton s lood on my hands did a lot to highlight the link between dubstep and minimal techno but both the original and remix only ever approached the idea of a hybrid genre from their respective corners red zone founder however has come up with a transcendent chimeric fusion of the two genres that shows the way forward if er dubstepno is going to grow as a viable entity this is a single that exists in a genreless space and it easily dismisses any attempt to pigeonhole it the -side first made waves when it appeared on the dat:music compilation coming out of marcus intalex s soul:r imprint and it now receives a vinyl release on the sister drum n bass label the track kicks off without hesitation sucking you into a phasing spiral of dub pulses straight from the asic channel dub techno school but with a greater sense of breathable air the track then slowly unwinds around a low throb of bass pitch shifted vocals and waves of synth that could almost have drifted in directly off a house track its faster than your average dubstep but slower than standard techno yet all with a sophisticated and frantic magnetism that is spellbinding on the flip side is a new track a little faster and just as special gain the high end of the rhythm section is the key to the sound infused with a perfect balance of pace without fury like there s plenty of space to listen and breathe and some more abstracted vocals but when the bass melody and the rhythm clusters finally lock in you know you are headed somewhere else there is a sense of surprise delight and urgency as the track evolves into a slightly dirty and soulful dancefloor gem is this techno is it dubstep it doesn t really matter and you are pretty likely to find it in played in sets of all types if you haven t already so damn good that you will need to move fast before its hard to find

how could the same group have made each of the cds in this package attention to detail ear for the oddball groove and skill at keeping a vibe going that makes disc one of such a sharp fleet dance mix would you might imagine also apply to disc twos back to ours/whatever we want selection obviously any group five members isnt going to see eye to eye or hear ear to ear all the time as s mix makes clear but to be honest so did s volume of the dj kicks series two years ago which began and ended show offy clumsily segued runs grosvenor into positive k into to start joe son into ray charles to finish but in between ured a mix that moved nicely even when it was flaunting its own eclecticism as when young leek and black devil club flanked an old etta es and sugar pie desanto blues disc one of is like that long middle reconstructed mostly techno tracks but all of its canny turns intact mix is full of stuff a laptopper a dance floor purist and a pop fan an adventurous ear could love equally: the floridly playful dy the of remix of s moving into s gurgling bounding is a prime example tracks from and match bulbous low end and colorful keyboard riffs that make the whole mix feel like a day at the beach disc two announces its intentions up front: lets have a disco all of these people in our front room begins s this case that means abrupt sometimes distracting segues as when s comes to a crash as s begins or gliding uneasily into s or the drastic slowdown to join into ce (remixed by ) worse it can inspire you to try blends as ill fated as s over terrence d rbys here jesus this is tedious what were they thinking od thing s great on to ends things otherwise you might think twice about going back

just in case you thought you had l i e s man pegged as one thing a purveyor of hard tracky chicago house where rhythm reigns supreme this limited-run black label 12-inch adds another couple of strings to his bow pairs the piledriving momentum of last years 4 club use only with a gorgeous gossamer-thin loop that sweeps across the tracks surface in a serotonin-prickling rush little more than a four-note motif picked out in shimmering blue its lent a hypnotic air by jackhammer drums that pound away underneath things take a turn for the darkside on sprk a manic ghetto house beast that storms along at well over 150 pm it sounds as though edwards is pushing his hardware right to the edge of its capabilities with tempo volume forced upward until everything peaks into a noisy overdriven mess percussion is violently foregrounded making it clear that sprk is still intended as a dance floor track (albeit a particularly sadistic one) chanted chopped voice is pitched down the words themselves impossible to make out in the gloom
needs no introduction really they continually deliver the good to their hordes of fans and their latest release featuring new order s peter hook is sure to be no different it definitely is the original mix is on the a-side and it begins with the smooth emotive vocals of adam taylor while atmospheric sounds rumble around soon enough a chunky 4/4 beat dives into the production accompanied by the brilliant and familiar guitar riffs from peter hook the trademark strings are featured as the vocal rides the production which combines the guitar and emotive elements to great effect another great production as you would expect on the flip is also very impressive john creamer stephane k remix the first few minutes of this remix are very lovely with emotive violins combining with the effected vocals and subtle guitar riffs to delightful results soon enough a solid drum beat enters with smooth base tones underneath the remix makes great use of the emotive violin stabs throughout and all in all is a great addition to a very good original a pretty good release that is a great indication of the sounds to expect from s album morning sci fi

marks their 3rd release with the taste of copenhagen tom von rosen and jokke are two danish producers known as and this release sees 2 of their recent works get pressed to vinyl for us to enjoy the new world is first up and it features some crisp drum patterns the production uses various effects and sounds to build but most of all uses some nice filtered synth effects in the second half of the production to give it its edge it s a nice deep piece of music from the danish duo on the flip is progress not as intense as the a-side this track uses a deeper baseline to get its message across it doesn t really progress as the name suggests but rather it plods along with no real essence or major positive points a disappointing production which lacks a bit of the energy the a-side had stick to the new world in this release which is quite a nice production but may not be good enough to convince people that this release is for them a disappointing follow up to the very impressive release by pashka
is a south london based hip-hop producer who easily could have been cast aside in a world full of press releases that abuse the phrase post-dilla but rather than just pairing blunted beats and cracking off-kilter snares hes steadily amassed a growing fan base by injecting a psychedelic disjointed and quite often humourous take on the genre previous work has seen him plundering prog and psych for his dense productions rapping with is him trying something completely different album takes seven mostly unknown mcs and inserts them into whites strange dreams results are dazzling res calming meditative moods on instrumental opener and the poetic closer stark ethereal and paranoid moments come from s and the somewhat underwhelming lead single featuring res also some pretty filthy stuff said in ways were not familiar with: s original flow on e of s is an orgiastic feast of flesh drugs and arrogance over a beat that goes from classic merican rock to mad-minute video game music similarly s wonderfully titled sees white taking on a boisterous frobeat motif while compares standing out in a crowded rap market to the hierarchy of the jungle takes on the idiosyncrasies of british culture from the perspective of an outsider merican albums strongest moment comes from who over a pitched-up power rock ballad and the most exciting use of a sustained feeding-back guitar chord since ghostface killahs celebrate absolutely dominates the mic menacing sub-standard mcs with such conviction it sounds like he might jump out of the speakers and have a stern word for you too similar to madlibs wlib effort for bbes beat generation series this album assembles a motley crew of unique and individual mcs and somehow makes them seem like a unit under the direction of white producer lps often stumble due to a lack of cohesiveness which more often that not comes from the anti-chemistry of swapping beats and vocals online with a number of did he just say that moments and more than a few quotables rapping with combines a series of moods and ideas and ties them together with quirky skits and a varied palate of samples all with the charm weve grown to expect from white
they have their differences but you can tell that and oddika split off from the same group: they both run on that jittery electro thread and both do it primarily through hardware ut where oddikas anaerobic analogue is bone-dry and sometimes suffocating convexs are rich and textural almost liquid though still determinedly greyscale its that latter aspect that makes convex a perfect fit for irish imprint [nakedlunch] (also home to you guessed it oddika) and his tracks here carve a path slightly darker than his ebullient 3024 debut they also sound less like oddika than convexations did is a writhing hip-hop monster with ticking snares that jump with syncopated glee the somewhat melancholic -side sounds more like his radar single on non lus+ that same blackened twitch but painted with synth brushstrokes its a solid addition to an utterly reliable label and a small step forward for a producer whose sound is steadily and confidently moving away from his closest peer
s first record for willie burns label feels like a refinement of ideas the german producer has been playing with for a while on a number of earlier tracks kupfer laid glassy melodies perilously over unforgiving drums three quarters of this self-titled ep focus on this aspect of his work and the tracks that follow this pattern are proof that kupfer has this style nailed down s title seems like a nod to kupfers breakout debut on l e s a sequel of sorts to in it plants crystalline melodies under a procession of dulled thuds that sound like the stomp of an angry upstairs neighbour ts wispy vocal shivers in the songs icy climate the puts less distance between the kick and the rest of the song the drums arent quite as sharp as they are on and bells fill the songs spaces in a way thats a bit more enticing introduces some toms and a few hi-hats that threaten to put a spring in the eps step but the dystopic synths bring it back down to earth s the black sheep of the 12-inch is an acid-laced dj tool with a hip-house vocal that does away with the prettiness of the other three letting loose in a style not unlike willie burns
mr is certifiably bonkers first a music video about a hand puppet then songs about moustaches and transexuals now a movie about hold up what the hell is about written and directed by himself the film is billed as a sci fi comedy set in a distinctly fifties looking where (i think) a gang of milk drinking youths wreak havoc by performing extreme facelifts that these dairy lovin body fascists include s soundtrack contributors and shows the creative freedom granted to these oddballs of the french music scene and the resulting score is predictably crackers throws together sub three minute tracks from producers used to knocking out ideas rather than fully formed songs (with the notable exception of s la ritournelle a twenty first century unfinished sympathy ) lightbulbs from the collective brain of and the sebs include funky bass jams slide guitar noodles electro spazzouts and on hysterical laughter and the sound of a jack in a box about to spring open mong the highlights are s glittering synth strumentals which prove that the rising ed banger star can do more than just edit heavy electro grind elsewhere mr out s his young prot g with the chopped up block rockers and c h i v e r s however these tracks are trounced by the collaborations where s battery beats meet the whimsical songwriting of troubadour tramp (again with the he shes ) does dancefloor danger music better than kavinsky and banjo banger layers s breathy vocals over bongos and a breakbeat to create the hottest hoedown ever so ends the fun and games the rest of the album is made up of grating noodles like which sounds like a monkey chewing on a drum machine and a mess of whistles kazoos and military snares no doubt these ditties are great accompaniment for whatever on screen mentalism has scripted but repeated home viewing would probably induce seizures because of the varying quality of the contributions listening to is the aural equivalent of rooting through the waste paper bin after a simpsons writers meeting occasionally peerless frequently frustrating but always amusing
its tempting to compare with another rising uk producer lex coulton like coulton hes not based in ristol (though he studies nearby in ath) but seems to have found like-minds in the city nd having debuted on pinchs new techno-leaning imprint cold he now appears on livity sound sub-label an honour he shares with coulton the label is an outlet for productions by outsiders that chime with livitys dread-techno aesthetic s dub-informed percussive sound is a neat fit seems to have homed in on his points of commonality with the label for this release s crunched-up kicks and juddering sub-bass nod to kowton while its filtered sheets of hi-hat call to mind pev kowtons raw code nd where s cold release had an unsettled jumpy quality theres a muscular sensuality to the groove here that recalls livitys strongest work ut in contrast to the stark precision often exhibited by his labelmates likes to whip up his atmospherics into a dubwise fog explores similar terrain its zombiefied stop-start shuffle isnt quite propulsive but you can imagine it wrestling a dance floor into motion all the same added to which the divebombing bassline is a treat judging by the leap in quality between s debut and this we can expect fine things from him in the future
if s first release of a self-titled ep for willie burns w t records gave you the impression he mightve lost his edge will swiftly and confidently refute that idea in fact the scrappy german producer kicks things up a notch with his latest diving headlong into relentless minimalism and the hypnosis of drawn-out rhythm describing techno as barebones is fairly commonplace but menacing tracks like and take the aesthetic to the extreme and though kupfer rides the style a bit far into extremes the severity pays off when he does choose to indulge in color and dynamics the heaving swell of is among s better productions and not only because kupfer somehow makes the lumbering nine-plus minutes feel like half the time its economy of sounds a thudding kick punch drunk pads seismic sub and light percussion is fully utilized thanks to kupfers attention to movement and space attempts a similar approach to ominous slow-mo groove but winds up closer to psychedelic wankery than engrossing head-fuck slow frequency shifts and fluctuating fx arent always enough sells itself short when it stops at a 4/4 kick-hat combo and a squelchy two-note bass arp even the slightest extra melodic or percussive detail couldve brought some needed depth to this half-baked dj tool thats exactly what kupfer does on and the added synth lines drum-machine artillery and vocal hijinx sets his lecherous techno jam a notch above they say less is more but sometimes less is just less
after the impressive 9th release on the label hit double figures thanks to and the original mix is quite a tasty piece of work flowing delightfully with a deep rolling baseline and some quirky subtle melodic lines like many of the releases on this label this track has a nice build and flow like a good progressive track should the michael lanning mix is a fair bit quirkier using some interesting drum patterns and subtle bleep sounds and effects it flows very nicely again with some good melodic patterns in there as the track progresses all in all creating a very good remix here from lanning
until now the brooklyn duo of thomas mullarney and jacob gossett have chiefly produced broken r b that rarely ventured above a gentle stroll post-club bury-your-head-in-the-pillow music it would be a stretch to suggest their first offering since 2013s the ways we separate is significantly different at least in terms of mood but it does see a shift towards a poppier even dancier milieu it proves to be a pretty good fit is pitched somewhere between thom yorkes maudlin solo experiments the glistening electro pop of morgan geist and travis stewarts emotive bass voyages its led by the low-slung alt-techno of filled with arps that trickle like a mountain stream and synths that are hammered with a zealous intensity the title track sees mullarneys yorke-style vocals come to the fore; theres the same world-weary tone which soars into a lovely falsetto on the gossamer-light chorus the scuttling drum bass-lite of sequence is s weakest track but redemption is instant: the glacial is enveloped by a lovely cloud of bubbly analogue synths and yet its outshone by an elegant slice of brooding deep house haunted by pads that elicit an almost church-like ambience it closes an intimate refined ep
young san soda hit his stride in 2009 via his releases for the boutique label started by belgian veteran dj red d primarily to release the producers work taking their cooperation a step further vocals for everyone marks the duos first collaborative release under the moniker a project theyre intending will recall a time when vocals were not something just for girls and gays vocals for everyone does precisely what it says on the tin reimagining archetypal 90s vocal house while retaining the labels characteristic deepness along the way a san soda solo venture lets is a slick take on gospel house featuring a trim four-note organ progression handclaps and tempered vocals from usg all maintaining an orderly balance with a bridge of violins and flashes of a pealing bell-like melody has red d taking up both the co-production reins and lyrical credits for thudding kicks key stabs and lady linns sultry i wanna see your body work / i wanna see your body moving vocals all of which recall an unmistakable chicago vibe despite recent playlists and charts tending to favour one or the other of these two watertight classic-sounding tracks the even scorecard is unbalanced by san sodas resourcefulness on lets taking a little from column a and a little from b he marries lets and for a near-perfect slice of modern vocal house the beat from the former is pared down to the kick-bass-clap essentials while the chiming bell sounds forms its distinctive melody lady linns vocals of the latter are scrambled i wanna see your body moving becoming the core directive this is a really solid ep of referential sounds with bonus points for san sodas goal-scoring mash-up

s second outing on is a good deal freer than his earlier pharmacy ep its four tracks unfurl like bizarre tendrils rather than charging to a climax foams all over the place occasionally channelled into a groove by an impetuous bassline in its odd soup industrial scrapings rub against pretty melodic swirls gritty synth lines and jangling cymbals is even more interesting a vocal sample that wouldnt sound out of place on a rap track synthetic string loops and an opiated bassline bring to mind the drawling melancholia of southern hip-hop with some bright percussive clicks tempering the darkness is deeper and more linear than its battered surfaces and warm groove expressing ecstasy and fatigue in one fell swoop is also more of a straight dance floor track but within its 4/4 frame clusters of polyrhythms samples and itchy synths move restlessly is jumbled but cohesive sounding informed as much by the dollar-bin sampling of leftfield hip-hop as by conventional techno and house
as comfortable with fm pop radio and hissy synth jams as he is with anthemic disco house stockholm producer s music is tied together only by sugary funk and a taste for novelty ( the moment i have a formula im probably not doing something good he said a few years ago ) uses house structures but stiltzs keyboards give some tracks an improvisational feel the a-side full of plastic sounds and big melodies merges stiltzs dance and pop instincts but the results on and land on a rootless diy aesthetic that doesnt hit home only has the charisma however strange to stick on cheap organ notes begin by parping on every third beat but later fan out into a hand-played effects-smeared arpeggio he goes even further out on a sweet pop confessional with gelatinous synths and a yearning vocal s b-side returns to s swung sticky house sound stiltz applies one of his hallmarks a sequencing accident where the beat seizes up and leaps onto an adjusted groove to xxx20003 weaving spontaneity and crayon-drawn squiggles into a more appealing tumble of percussion hand drums and synths im features some of s best ideas cute arps icy textures and stiltzs pitch-bent vocals supply a satisfyingly strange coda for an ep whose embrace of imperfection yields uneven results
back in the 1980s and somewhat into the 90s music obsessives spent a lot of free time making mix tapes much like the central character in high fidelity people spent hours in front of their vinyl collections carefully piecing together a compilation of songs that would be perfect for an upcoming party on friday night or for when a bunch of friends would come around to drink beer and nobody could be bothered changing records for the next 90 minutes most people didn t have mixers back then so each song had to stand on its own while somehow complementing the tracks before and after it cut to today mix cds are largely in the province of electronic music often aimed at the dancefloor and showcase both a dj s mixing skills and their artistic ability to construct a single narrative other than the back to mine and choice series there are few mix cds that hark back to the 80s compilation feel of a selection of tracks enter s at the controls a glance at the artist/tracklist of the double cd set suggests that at the controls will showcase at his border hopping best plastikman beside massive attack 70s krautrock band harmonia beside the midi miliz the idm of christ beside the laptop lo-fi ambience of fennesz yet what holds these tracks together (so disparate at first glance) is not a stunning display of cross-genre mixing from holden but the indie-rock aesthetic that so many of them share guitars dominate many of the tracks along with live sounding drumming especially in the tracks by death in vegas meta 83 and malcolm middleton vocals are equally important with many of the tracks essentially functioning as songs such as middleton s solemn thirsty trans am s cold war and apparat s wooden furthermore while mixed most of these tracks are allowed their own identity given time to breathe and speak for themselves of course it s not all indie-rock (or electronica reminiscent of indie rock); there are plenty of electronic booty shaking moments midi miliz s trace function apparat s mix of nathan fake s charlie s house and paul kalkbrenner s gebr nn gebr nn will get heads nodding and hips swaying however this is not a mix for the dancefloor a dancefloor track is just as likely to segue into an indie song as it is into another dancefloor number holden actually faces something of a tough sell with at the controls for those fond of his progressive past or looking for another mix similar to his balance mix this may be somewhat disappointing similarly fans of techno may not be happy expecting something directed at the dancefloor after looking at the tracklist however for those who want a mixed compilation of tracks and songs for home listening or as a soundtrack to their next friday night knees-up at the controls is the best mix(ed) tape you ve never made recommended

s first solo release for laurie osbornes came in june its -side blended summer soul with an off-kilter garage framework and was the ristol producers watershed track three months later a deeper more muscular scuba edit appeared as the midway crescendo on his dj-kicks mix but no official release ever followed having been a recurring feature in osbornes sets for the past two years scubas eight-minute sc edit now finally sees a vinyl release alongside a freshly produced dub mix whereas the original edit embedded trance undertones and cavernous reverb to create an epic rushing number the dub version centres on its bounding weight theres also far less emphasis on the climatic breakdown with the build becoming only a backdrop feature oth versions are strong in their own right and the alternative version does bring something new to the table ut perhaps a release a while back would have benefited the original edits initial momentum

sampling really is one of those mysterious black arts isnt it do it just right and youve got gold; do it too much and youve got a lawsuit use something recognizable and its a brilliant hook use something too recognizable and youre a lazy bastard whats a poor producer to do ts probably better not to ask darran nugent and pavel lenchenko because with on theyve managed to bungle this black art in a spectacular way the track an otherwise functional if unmemorable house track sitting on a politely driving groove remarkably manages to do nearly everything wrong taking snippets of fleetwood macs go your own way theres a risk right there in itself pretty much wholesale and bizarrely shoehorning them where they dont even fit theres something about that just sounds embarrassingly amateurish leaving the sample untouched in large chunks its such an unwieldy thing that it practically stops the beat in its tracks just for those few syllables of lindsey buckingham (to add insult to injury they arent in the right key ) alexkid steps in for a mostly instrumental remix strengthening the groove and kicking up the pace but otherwise leaving it fairly faithful revealing that the song underneath the vocal sample isnt really anything notable either strangely its the other two remixes that not only rise above the original in terms of quality but actually shed some light on how nugent and lenchenko could have done things better oleg s version again goes the mostly instrumental route but beefs up the low-end shreds the vocal sample into mostly microscopic grunts and adds balearic-lite piano layers to uplifting effect ts phonogenics disco dub that finally manages to fit the sample in somewhat organically: it still sounds a little cumbersome but riding the lapping waves of the lush yet wooden beat its more convincing than any other moment on the ep

records tend to be two things: really fucking heavy and weird stands out for how straightforward it is especially next to records by cylob and edmx scalameriya is a serbian producer with a particularly evil perspective on techno (think brostep-levels of aggression) while italian vsk is a little more cerebral the approaches are complementary and come together well on the artists first collaborative project the record is aggressive like other releases yet it channels that energy with a precision that feels unusual for the label the title track lays it out best its piledriving kicks and metallic squeaks warning anyone who dares drop a needle on this record is techno that could soundtrack a horror movie though the duo never get campy or over-the-top gives its fist-pumping chord progression and powerful rhythm section a crunchy coat of grit yet its efficient and cleverly arranged by the same token with its bounding drum pattern and conventional techno build couldve come out on ostgut ton with noisy growls that sound like a malfunctioning motor finds scalameriya vsk at their dirtiest though its still marked by a certain sleight of hand across the producers are like muzzled dogs: they snap and bark but never bite though it lacks some of the typical madness this is a solid functional techno record
victor martinez is a spanish artist and the mind behind recordings and this year he seems intent on pushing the sounds his new project axiom coherent states the full-length album released a few months ago on is scheduled to be the subject a series remixes this year first in that series puts an original together with reworks from paul obtane and agony original track of is an appropriate introduction to the sound pushes throughout the album and its sticky psychedelia rises just barely above the din similarly bleak contemporary techno with obtane on board to remix however theres too much emphasis on one style zool t label bosss own take on abstract techno works for me because his droning basslines and hi-hat rushes have room to expand contract and go f on beatless tangents at a relatively short six minutes in length this remix is one obtanes weaker moments: its just too static meanwhile s take on of is smoothed out and layered with some warm atmospheric vibes and it comes across as more focused than the original agony remix with its dramatic pauses and raw dried-out trebles is just as assertive and even more dynamic hard to pick a favorite the two but the and af versions easily form the better half the record
the incredibly prolific returns to steve bug s poker flat label with serving up two tracks for the dancefloor listeners hoping for a pair of dancefloor destroyers akin to tejadas previous poker flat release sweat (on the walls) or the palette released mono on mono however may be somewhat disappointed title track starts with a bubbling bouncing melody that is quickly joined by a high hat and then handclap beats the melody continues being fed through filters as the track progresses rising and expanding fattening out and slimming down again this mutating melody is the main focal point of the track and is carried along by deep minimal beats and bleeps it gets its groove on nicely and will prove useful to djs who want to maintain a deep groove on the dancefloor however the track has no particularly strong kicks or high peaks so will be best used by djs to help build or sustain a minimal mood asanebo kicks off quickly with a high lilting melody accompanied by chirps a whirring clicking sound (like some kind of wind-up toy) and then a wonderfully deep bassline before too long the main melody comes in a high echoing melody that rises and falls up and down the register a deeper bass-heavy line is then introduced to mirror this melody giving the track some serious dancefloor swagger just like asanebo has no strong kicks (the introduction of the bass-heavy line halfway through the track is the closest it comes) so while it will keep a dancefloor moving it won t get a dancefloor screaming then is a solid ep for djs who are looking to build or sustain a deep minimal groove on the dancefloor those looking for peak time material however are advised to look elsewhere (or just slap on mono on mono again)
alex dolby and undo/redo deliver 2 great produtions for the on italian label the release has seen massive support from pete tong and sasha in particular alex dolby psiko garden a track that a certain sasha has pretty much made his own in the last 6 months and has even edited the original version i review here there is something about psiko garden that you just can t ignore whether it be the addictive melodic hooks or the raging synths that appear late in the production the track is very catchy quality work by alex dolby who has already followed up this massive track with another due out shortly on mantra undo/redo driver pink enrico ferrari is behind the undo/redo guise with this production the track uses a chunky kick drum and rumbling baselines to keep a steady flow in the track while smooth floating effects roam in and out; all while a little funky edged loop gives the track a summer feel 2 great artists combine to showcase what this great italian label is all about
lready responsible for freak n chic s top-selling single in the shape of the ubiquitous mazon and having recently released the second deep-house tinged get lost mix compilation on crosstown rebels perennial flavour of the month shows with this ep that his success up to now hasnt been a fluke the ep both straddles on the right side of cheese and delivers the kind of tonic to the dancefloor that most producers would kill to make like pan-pot s charly the ep is another example of the current thirst for vocals and like charly its not the type of track youll be hearing being covered at a karaoke party anytime soon this one is a drug story too the vocal dominates and the backing track is simple bleeping along in the background to a handclap and a muffled heartbeat it s not too dissimilar to jones last single release on crosstown rebels differing slightly in pitch but retaining the same basic elements cant elieve im is a more serious affair using warped acid sequences that send the listener into a downward spiral of uncertainty the narrative continues on from side but the flip was a walk in the park compared to this the protagonist eventually loses control railing against the motherfuckers (who) left me like five hours ago after having taken some shit i hadnt taken before before triumphantly declaring but theres no way im going home oth tunes are two sides of the same (dark) coin and both are eminently playable with the second being my personal favourite because it reminds me of am ams wheres your child a track that set the standards for vocal darkness and one that has yet to be bettered every so often a track comes along and does exactly what is required of it were spoilt for choice here as both sides are exemplary examples of generic dancefloor mayhem simple but powerful release from

perhaps the label of 2003 gets ready to do its thing yet again this time with a release from the very in form the man that brought us the stunning dangerous ep this time he brings us another impressive release which also comes armed with a remix from laid on the a-side is firstly the original mix a production that can only be described as delicious tech house with an irresistible funky edge this production flows smoothly with a slight and thankfully not overdone acid edge and a smooth blissful baseline pattern the sounds of the production are never obvious however they work brilliantly in unison to create a stunning result much like his previous production such as dangerous it s safe to say that yet again the duo have turned in the goods following this is pass me the tools which surprisingly enough is a collection of dj tools to play with on the flip is firstly the laid remix it s another bouncy reinterpretation with the acid lines gaining in intensity and the beats flowing quite strongly throughout laid turns on the effects throughout but most importantly retains the classic funk of the original mix following this is the dub mix which is short but quite sweet keeping in tact some of the finer points of the original such as the melodic undertones as well as the acid lines the noticeable absence is the presence of a baseline until it hits the second half of the track but as mentioned the track is quite short compared to the build and structure of the original mix simply put this release is yet again very bloody impressive from the cuba lads importantly this release is very much destined for a dancefloor as the subtle sounds that you hear work miracles on a bigger soundsystem nevertheless it doesn t take an incredible amount of volume to see that this release is very tasty
s music often seems to present familiar styles smudged and estranged by the iberian sun parts of the lisbon trios 2015 ep did it with deep house while asa from last years s o jo o baptista ep did it with wig-out jazz fusion the recent 37 was their detroit and/or chicago record passing motowns techno-optimism and jamal mosss house psychedelia through a heat-warped lense on from the third record on the trios own label dub is the dominant flavour this is largely down to the mournful pentatonic lead line which does a decent imitation of augustus pablos melodica but its also in the backing track which has dubs space and loping gait albeit as ever made strange and unsettling on the b-side is more mutant new york disco its drum machine bump a vessel for jaunty harmonica and an obnoxiously twangy guitar riff the two are out of tune with one another which alongside spooky voice interjections helps make a maddeningly cheery idea sound dark and twisted the mood is recapped on the closer 2 where a more subdued harmonica picks its way between bursts of down-pitched laughing percussion rattles and the sounds of poured water and wind

take a moment to consider how jeremy greenspan and atthew didemus rolled out their fifth studio album as had been half a decade since their previous full-length s ll true and two years since ull y hair back jessy lanzas breakthrough debut album which greenspan helped write and produce there was reason to believe were no more giving them the perfect stage for an over-the-top comeback know the kind complete with teasers rumors slowly leaked details and the like but there was no fabricated mystery no elaborate marketing scheme simply an announcement and a new song casual and understated as ever greenspan and didemus seemed to be making a point: isnt the triumphant return of its just the next chapter in an ongoing story those who have followed along since 2004s last exit or the olaris rize-nominated so this goodbye havent sounded this strong in nearly a decade the duo revitalized their austere synth pop rendering it warm to the touch and looking beyond its traditional sound palette some songs may dazzle more intensely than others ( s ever ) some may have more lasting value ( ) but like the best of their kind they all catch the eye when they first appear of course the power lies in didemus and greenspans knack for effusive melody and acute dance floor know-how a potent combination that remarkably never becomes formulaic searing lead ends the slow-burning psychedelic ballad c on flipping on a dime to s sensitive boogie-funk before the vintage chicago-isms of set up es for a synthy mid-album sigh even at 50 minutes long has creative energy to spare by the time its through s hard to find flaws in an album this rich and satisfying without coming off as nit-picky e song feels needless however: the cover of bobby caldwells 1978 hit wont with its two-octave bassline and dispassionate vocal the previously released track sounds regressive and rudimentary like a beefed-up echo of so this goodbye s superior frank sinatra cover sets the tone for s largely 4/4-oriented back half but even that sections standouts s ever and which make fierce use of techno ideas couldve done the trick with more charisma and tenacity when speaking to r about his work with jessy lanza greenspan explained lot of the tracks were born out of me turning quite experimental song fragments and production ideas into something that sort of resembles pop songs since was inspired by years spent on such external projects there seems to have been a similar process here s success didnt come down to how different can sound but how natural they can sound despite the quirks greenspans versatile falsetto is the key to it all his tenderness turns confessional when singing lines like baby hope is for the middle of the night / but hope is fading with the first of them who saw daylight gracious honesty feeds his basest expressions and charming clich s too candid affability and late-night wisdom has always been and still remains the essence of makes feel like business as usual for greenspan and didemus even as it does more with their wealth of experience than ever before

electro funk and outer space have a long history with one another but s may be among the first instances in which dr dres brand of funk has been sent into the stratosphere it sounds like it was born to do it though in the hands of the young controller k 19 year-old irish producer jack hamill squiggly melody runs through the second half of the track contrasting with the delicate early ochum welt backing as a vocoded hamill ask us where we want to go and assuring us that hell take us there well then has no such theatrics instead relying on its pinprick beat and deep dueling bass melodies its a lovely throwback to the days when groups like plod plone and plaid seemed like the wimpiest and loveliest groups on earth like those three acts though theres something more to the music than just a knack for a hook its a childlike glee that informs the music as though sounds and songs are being discovered for the first time for hamill thats most likely the case to rediscover what that sounds like you could do far worse than this striking little 12-inch
this is the final ep taken from the highly sought after homegrown album from for those of you that have heard the first two instalments you will know exactly what to expect as were treated to another special blend of porterhouse comprising of four tracks first up is fluffer nutter which from the very start lays down the groove to satisfy any taste porter serves up a boiling hotpot of sumptuous warpy piano melodies steroid house beats and energy driven bassline that all come together with a movement that grips you while this is going on we catch glimpses of whats really happening in between with shades of guitar riffs and live sounding percussion creeping through briefly before easing back into the mix between 9 10 comes next and has a sparkly touch to it with twinkling synth sounds and funked up bassline that make up another emotive flow bouncing away with itself while bobble daze follows with a grinding feel to it taking shape from its onset with jackin bassline and steroid beats last up is an added extra not seen on the lp neptune has all the charisma of a porter track oozing an aristocratic persona thats created by jazzy melodies and classical sounds over chunked up beats with over fifty singles under his belt porter is moving into a new phase with a completely distinctive sound his music is as refreshing exciting and ultra clean as ever before
has never been shy about his influences even when hes not being as obvious as calling an ep phex you can guess what strahil velchev mightve been listening to before making certain records 2010s existence was a direct nod to jeff mills changes life ; 2015s fantasia leaned on giorgio moroder hes covered a wide range of inspirations over his prolific career from gnarly breakbeat like 2011s rave signal to jazzy house such as leko from the same year a tribute to radiohead only in name is a good introduction to the sound that prevails on velchevs latest lp its reese bassline and whirl of bleeps and drones is typical of the house and techno bangers for which hes known (by contrast his debut lp 2014s under destruction had a more experimental feel ) re are a few exceptions which vary in style and quality s uk techno is uninspired when compared with the artists in bristol and london exploring that sound more adventurously s opulent harmonies and blaring keys dont quite gel on the other hand e could pass for plaid in their prime nd ends the album with a soothingly sentimental caress of keys and strings its the big sounds though that velchev does best s filtered disco would have demolished dance floors 20 years ago and with the help of a random guy has done so in hardcore-evoking uses a similar sub-bass line to laying the foundations for its euphoric synth leads recalls the 90s progressive house that bicep have lately explored to such crowd-pleasing effect t its best draws from these styles with the sense of fun thats defined much of velchevs catalogue
amps humming in a silent room recorded to tape and played back at alternate speeds: this is the sort of thing that might begin a track these layers of dirt (an idea moffa picked up from friend and collaborator dj spider) are the foundation of many of the new yorkers productions moffas techno can be immediate but it often unspools gradually revealing a great enveloping depth background resonance or tiny details often feature as the main event as moffa makes us not only listen to but viscerally connect with these sounds delivers the multi-dimensional sonic experience one could expect from moffa shimmers with ethereal trails echoing his stunning debut for most excellent unltd except here theres a crescendo where lightness flips to stormy dissonance s beats are submerged deep under water with modulated noise thrumming a pitter-patter melody on the surface volte-faces remix which is more conformist brings the kick up for air and increases the atmospherics the suspenseful is the track fans of moffa and dj spider s work will be most drawn to its dark and full of terror but theres a happy ending
if you havent checked out pal contra anna maria x - back 2 back sessions vol 1 its well worth a listen building as a club set would and progressing with a constant energy from start to finish featuring tracks from some well known names and a few new faces this latest 12 inch release from swift includes more upfront tracks taken from the compilation on the a-side is b i carpe diem one of the standout tracks on the mix tight beats and a peaky mix of emotive sounds set the pace as piece-by-piece parts intertwine all made sweeter with the use of ethnic vocals the mood swells up and sits back into proceedings throughout with elements coming to the fore breaking with a complete sense of serenity bliss plastique vision mos feat julie amadeo fuel to the fire is on the flip side concocting an energetic vibe with almost techy percussion setting the pace deep stabs creep in along with a grinding synth hit before the melody draws you into an insatiable groove parts develop further with the introduction of the vocal hitting off each other and breaking in a series of strip backs before powering ahead again with intense purpose a tasty edition to any prog-flavoured set
regular continues the three-part colored vinyl series highlighting tracks from peaks and troughs backed by exclusive remixes with a three-tracker that showcases his trademark style with a few new wrinkles featuring two lp tracks its a release that bodes very well indeed for the lp as with the lead track on part 1 features the inimitable voice of st (formerly known as tikiman) and the mix of his deep soulful vocals and metals dub/techno/click hybrid goes down smoothly bubbling with percussive energy and a haunted spaghetti western theme st s vocals add a texture and melodic heft missing from much of dub techno and the track is busy and active a perfect antidote to the avalanche of cookie-cutter dub tracks that have been clogging the racks for the last few months the original version of is an up-tempo (well for dub techno anyway) workout with some serious bounce to it it sounds as if metals machines are infested with racquetballs their rubbery tones affecting everything coming out of the speakers on a molecular level echoing and bounding off of each other into space part 1 closed with a cassy remix and part 2s flip is filled here with a stunning take on from pole upping the tempo even further with a relentless click track thats soon joined by a crackling hi-hat betke runs the originals elastic tape through his unique set of filters and emerges with his busiest and most floor-friendly track in ages a rattling rhythmic journey that abandons betkes standard stealth-static attack for an altogether more aggressive result if the prospect of buying the separate singles just to get the remixes had you on the fence about these releases rest assured that poles version is worth the price of admission alone betkes been on a remixing roll of late (check his versions of shackletons shortwave and trentem llers miss you if you missed them) and may very well be the best of the bunch
munich dj/producer releases his latest offering luck n love on a label whose ethos is to discover and nurture young talented artists they definitely must see potential in cavalerra but potential really is the operative word here as while some good elements are at play on two of the three tracks ultimately the ep doesn t reach the upper tier of dance music productions the title track is an emotive warm floaty number which rolls along at a gentle yet danceable pace trance-like undertones are subtlety present and the beats are sharp and crisp be warned: this track may spontaneously induce pilled-up ravers to hug the nearest stranger and start gushing about how much they love them it s a far cry from and a fresh alternative to the deluge of dark minimal numbers that have been making the rounds the last few years and will work better at sunrise in the open country rather then in a dark sweaty club of course if dark and evil is your thing you won t be overly impressed is far more disappointing it ups the trance quotient but inside it s really striving to be an electro banger i can imagine kids in ghent with glow sticks getting down to this; the cheesy repetitive melody simply loops over and over again leaving you bored and cringing finally is a hypnotic ambient affair which lies on the more minimal spectrum of the scale but still retains the warm positivity of the opening track again the main melody loops throughout but much more effectively this time around as elements subtlety come and go in a dreamy fashion this is a definitely a number to wind things down with rather than to ignite the dance floor but could lead well into an epic end of the night number throwaway track aside the warm lushness of this ep gives it a little bit more distinction than a lot of other music out there and is a step in the right direction if cavalerra could tone down the cheesiness and make his tracks a little less simple he could be on to something positive
wrote with keysound in mind and it shows though its the bristol producers first ep for the label (second overall after a 2014 effort on durkle disco) youd be hard-pressed to find a better example of third-phase keysound than this record sparse funky and slippery is modern wot-do-you-call-it club music of a high standard the sound of someone who clearly did his homework offers two originals and two self-made remixes is sparse but that quality only underlines its strange spellbinding funk spaced-out rhythm seems strung together with twine and each drums dry snap sounds like a weird slant on peak-era roska vocal is snaky and staccato to match dub mix of doesnt do much besides push the mc back its fine but feels like a waste of space on a four-track record sharpens his attack on which slips in and out of 4/4 time so gracefully youll barely notice it (not unlike his peers wen or moleskin) this ones driven by a big boomy bassline that stands out amidst the pitch black as does whose lyrics drive a wedge between the sporadic beats its strange to have a devil mix of an already skeletal track but nonetheless shows off his remarkable skill for reduction boiling down so every tiny element feels important re and on the original exhibits a knack for powerful minimalism that should take him far in the keysound realm and beyond

young and a new comer to the scene is his new explores the realm of classic house beats and old skool flavours all the while keeping things nice and funky side taking things back a few years is a refresher to the styles of daft punk when they were in their homework era phat basslines plenty of funk and excessive usage of filters make this one suitable for a french house vibe side takes it back to electro house transferring the funk to the charged up bassline and breaking up the beats to get out of that repetitive four to the floor rhythm this tune maintains a sassy appeal thanks to the sexy female vocal samples laced throughout one for a peaktime set on harder dancefloors side b after quite a long intro of house beats and muffled bass introduces a guitar riff to the beat in unison with the bass its a mix of rock and constant repetition of the words to and features two very long winded breakdowns containing what seems to be a sample o a live recording didnt really appeal to me however it is a tune that should get a massive following especially from the peaktime house massive
steer clear of this talented man (its claimed here) jean-francois mouliet is attempting to do louche punk funk a la spektrum esg or inflagranti he fails the beats on the title track are passable enough but when m mouliet opens his mouth things go downhill at best it sounds like hes fighting back tears but whenever he strains it becomes incredibly irritating like a bad parody of a falsetto the lyrics are appalling too you dont expect much but when youre faced with on : you drive me mad so mad so mad it makes me sad so sad and on : she feels like another glass i feel like kicking your ass toooonight cos tooonights the night its impossible to take seriously like esgs songs these are both stripped down to the bare elements of bass drums and minimal effects thats where the comparison ends the whole presentation of these songs really got my back up theyre trendy as you like but with no substance at all behind the pose avoid on remix duty are the normally reliable escort but even they cant salvage things despite pretty making it into a completely different song they add in vocals backing brass but cant raise it above the kind of house music twats mistake for sophisticated when its just dull the fabrizio remix stretches it out over seven minutes in a balearic and cosmic style its the best of the lot but thats not saying much
when debuted on rush hour last year it was with two hunks of throbbing dubby techno that earned comparisons to fellow swedes skudge who were themselves just starting to make waves around the same time now the mysterious swedes have joined ranks together as part of skudges s series make no mistake: this is pretty dark stuff but something about the way sways in its ebullient elliptical pattern feels playful even in the face of the ominous bits of chords that coat its background if the overcast is lighthearted then pink man is basically the rapture taking the melodic elements of close to me and stripping them back to skudge-appropriate levels of heavily-veiled euphoria pink man pivots around a distant vocal sample with a gleeful but rigid arpeggio (think instra:mentals resolution 653 ) whose high octaves sound totally out of place amidst all the grey s moody techno stood out on rush hour last year and his efforts on skudge are just as worthy of attention proving that the not-so-prolific producers 2010 stroke of finesse was not merely a one-off
can ever just be again in the aftermath of the enormous success of traversable wormhole both in its original anonymous incarnation and its reissue series on clr it seems the answer is no the erlin producers music appears to have been permanently affected by his flirtation with the erghain-inspired dance floor sounds with the exception of a collaborative ep with like-minded techno primitives ncient methods is s first release since the opening of the wormhole and also his first for s such it carries a bit of baggage but it does so with utmost style and stride its not as if the man has completely reinvented his style: there are sonic tics that hint back towards his more industrial work but there are also plenty that seem indebted to traversable wormhole oth tracks are sprawling and reduced taking their time unfolding themselves in a determined straight line (like much of the catalogue); and like traversable wormhole they consist of hovering elements that seem to circle around the songs core instead of merely fading in and out of the mix starts with the basics a clicking kick that quickly begins to stir up a dust storm of pinging chords and ominous drones until elements begin to blur its messier and more abrasive than any of the wormhole tracks thats where the name comes in but its comparatively limber functionality seems a far cry from the distorted and static-coated screams of his previous album state of limbo the flipside confirms the lingering influence of the erghain pairing klock-style industrial shudders and whooshes with xs own characteristic metallic snares and militant programming it seems as if through the wormhole project mr x has rediscovered subtlety: and while hes not about to go all stl on us its already proving a good look for him
is gergely szilveszter horv th a young producer from budapest who has collaborated with opal tapes associate stephan olbricht as set pwri tmod and makes dazed analogue house by himself his release for greek newcomer fits well into the druggy boogie sound the label has established theres a melancholic tint to s material feels like it never really starts: you wait and wait for the chords to kick in and once they do theyre muted like an autonomic glow reduced to a flicker is similar but more atmospheric and its given a good kick in the ass by dj who wraps its loose limbs in a tighter house framework horv ths tracks arent floor fillers but his drum sounds are heavy and satisfying carrying more oomph than the songs elegiac qualities would suggest is the prettiest with pads that fog up the beat like breath on cold glass its on that he finally gives in to the dance floor crafting a straight-up house number that still feels a little wounded

alec storey is a details guy sometimes to a fault his solo work lately as can favour sound design wizardry over clarity of ideas returning to the project after a spell with his appleblim collaboration also something seems to have changed the ep still runs on a complex machinery of burbling synth patches tight drum edits and rubbery delays but its housed in a sleek new electro framework and augmented by a crafty way with melody all four of these tracks could be about a minute shorter but storeys music has rarely sounded so invigorating the first two are built around fidgety arppegios and clinically precise drums on the title track a melodic progression stealthily unfolds as the track wears on but storey keeps it partially concealed beneath metronomic hi-hats and layers of scudding micro-texture vapour is the same premise after a course of steroids: the drums are more kinetic and the melodies bolder on storey raises the tempo to circa 150 bpm this was an excellent idea you start to wonder why the whole ep doesnt thunder along at this speed but it serves to make closer feel all the more sluggish the tracks gloopy hook is clever storey has never had trouble being clever but the beat underneath lacks his newfound fleet-footed funk
is a promising dutch label focused on the artification of deep atmospheric music so far thats meant reverb heavy dance music polished to the point that it almost sounds slippery exemplified by the glossy dub techno of label founder the shiny sounds are easy to like but they can just as easily go in one ear and out the other the labels best moments like s exposed or natan hs erklingen take a straight ahead approach bolstered with little details and idiosyncrasies s contribution to the labels first compilation ep is his finest work yet with this formula is a charging dub techno tune like chain reaction with a makeover the steamrolling drums give it a muscle that dub techno often lacks especially once they double up halfway through percussion is the secret weapon on with its surging but woozy melodies s initially sounds like a melancholy life and death style number but the piled on drum programming makes it unpredictable slipping in and out of lively rolls and broken tom patterns go with drum breaks on and they add dramatic string melodies that make it feel like a house version of ltj bukems atmospheric drum bass belgian duo dont make the same impact with where an undulating brass lead thrashes around while the rest of the tune motors along its a serviceable track but it lacks the personality of its counterparts
the relatively simple concept of the first electric calm was produced and stacked on shelves around the world in a (by standards) fairly understated way it was a compilation put together with the use of the back catalogues of the two gu sub labels quad communications and coded this second release in the series follows a similar line to the last with a few noticeable improvements they have signed up some great production work outside of the gu subsidiaries to ensure this next mix is something more diverse and relaxed yet at the same time seems to have an added level of both thought and planning the album slides into play with inner calm an immensely ambient intro featuring more than its fair share of calming sounds it then starts us off with very unique the roots by luke chable as lo step feat lior attr which upon hearing many of you will instantly recognise from dave seaman s gu:002 but this mix is very different the major pumping break beat backbone is missing but strangely enough as you would expect to really feel (and miss) their removal the ambient levels that are enhanced bring this impressive mood lifting remix right the way through to the next track the forth known for various mixing and production work for gu continues this journey of sound in a very relaxed and beautifully-ambient pace to nowhere mentally straining with the next couple of tunes and in taking this very relaxed approach towards mixing each of the tracks has been toned down cut back edited and layered to create the most aurally-satisfying sounds the planned and openly stated vibe of this compilation is spot on as the forth continues with tracks from j-punch pbas and the first two (of three on the disc) by trafik the kaleidoscopic sounds of avatar with their glitter love nail down the detailed simplicity of this compilation trafik s third track hard to resist continues with its collection of solidly compiled ambient beats together with a great simple drawn out female vocal and brings the album finishes as you would expect with nothing but incredibly soothing relaxing and mind cleansing sounds by the likes of pako frederik with make me bluefish with mellow mellow and feels like forever by twisted air feat caroline thorp i was very happy to see that gu is continuing this series as it is something out of the ordinary and not some cheesy chill-out compilation produced for the masses it s a cd that matures with each listen a great solution to those ringing eardrums after a big night out and generally one of the finest aurally purifying cds to date
is best known as half of the production duo teengirl fantasy ating back to 2009 their music overloaded and wonderfully clunky seemed inspired by the early internet just look at their original domain page : hosted on angelfire it was a weirdly earnest approximation of 90s-era personal websites it was cramped crowded cute and filled with myriad graphics fonts and colors; teengirl fantasys nostalgic style seemed to generate from that aesthetic their 2010 hit cheaters was if anything a sonic manifesto for lived-in sounds and deep web exploration now with his first solo album takahashi takes a turn for the introspective but continues to mine the past in effective ways the title is an inversion of neo geo a video game system from the early 90s and a music genre ushered in by ryuichi sakamoto through his album of the same name takahashi says he also drew from the early 00s brooklyn tabletop electronics scene overall he wants the album to reflect his concept of technology as organic extensions of society and the planet reflected in the selection of sounds in s best songs takahashi extracts a danceable palette from banal drones take cella a track that makes a telephones ring impossibly funky more interesting than the concepts is the slow controlled simmer of exuberance thats all over songs like create the feeling of floating through a digital landscape the album plays like a smooth minimalist study of video game-inspired electronic music using an elektron monomachine as the backbone for his compositions takahashi takes a straightforward and unfussy attitude with his tracks while they can be predictable they arent tiresome when scoring his own films john carpenter would often use only a synth and drum machine as a way of cutting costs his stripped-down method lead to things that flitted between cheesy and expansive perhaps unintentionally borrows from this attitude songs are compact thrillers stretching cheap-o aesthetics into epic soundscapes highlights like and are full of buoyant snaps and whimsical sounds bouncing into each other a dud like is more melodramatic unable to decide what kind of song or situation it wants to convey then there are tracks like which sounds like a half-hearted pastiche of 80s-tinged guitar and warbling e m-sourced buzzes throughout a handful of such moments muddle its clarity and risk making the nostalgia feel contrived but takahashi is mostly thoughtful with his approach with an acute awareness of the past he delivers updated versions of classic ideas better than many
the french duo will soon release their much-anticipated debut album on rixtons going good label in case your appetite for this lp needs further whetting emmanuel corre and silv re letellier have slipped out the d tente ux enfers 12-inch on their own music outlet few years ago when the pair were living in london they struggled to balance their creative urges with the citys financial demands now based in erlin s music shows the extra vibrancy that can come with greater creative freedom this is seen on -side s a twisting techno track that bristles with kineticism throughout its 13 minutes s long but there is plenty to explore as corre and letellier deftly orchestrate phrases based around crumbling unpredictable drums and washes of ambience is more forthright and feels more interested in clubs than emotions there is something satisfying about its chunky beat which is boosted by strange vocodered voices and mangled snatches of keyboard s easy to imagine corre and letellier bopping around their studio while making this tune s hard to stop yourself from dancing too

with a name like we can assume two things first this californian duo own a pair of monitors with ribbon tweeters championed particularly by a company called adam second that its a technology well worth considering you see is an ep thats very impressively produced considering that everyone involved is relatively unheralded (aside from chris ) is steady moody and rocking all at the same time its got the kind of hugeness and polish that youd expect out of cocoon but its coolly restrained meanwhile is more laidback with a dragging breakbeat and a subtle harmonic progression chris s remix is heavy on the roland kit using a 303 and an 808 along with a few other samples to create lots of tension his prog days are evidently far behind him but he employs lessons learned from that time holding the tension effectively the oilpanic remix toughens up the electro breakbeat of the original and ive got a particular penchant for this kind of thing so its my favourite although each person will have their preference on this release (the dj feedback thus far quickly makes this clear) oilpanic is a pretty good conceptual starting point for a description of the track actually: the hard hitting bass hook is made from solidified shiny globules of oil with the panic being the urgency and drama they engender and as if that wasnt enough he then moves things into a somewhat deeper africa-tinged vibe later on by overlaying a clunky woodblock riff
as 2am/fm james t cotton and dmarc cantu explore the sound of early rephlex and trax records releases the four-track ep their third for is no different: its a stripped and urban-grimy affair bathed in black and stripes of neon a rewarding engagement with early acid house on the 303 squelches have their releases heavily clipped producing a terse and aggressive sound akin to laser-welding in a jersey turnpike oil refinery the whole track shudders and convulses with a tense and epileptic gait punctured with bursts of compressed percussion while spooky short-circuited traces of human speech alternately intone jack and house pressurized ominous and militarized its easily the standout which follows cuts a vein open in the stiff claustrophobia traced by its predecessor allowing the blood to flow: the acid tweaks are now in full bloom and dense machine-gun claps and snares momentarily drown the track throughout its length in swaths of swollen phase its the most straightforward excursion here bridging the harsh paranoia of the first to the occult anthemics of that track with deadpan lyrics like experimental sound experimental vision / this is us who we are / this is our religion functions as a default manifesto for the duo the atmosphere is carved out by some hi-freq cave reverb on the clap paired with super-sparse synth plonk across the clusters of pitchshifted vocals eerie trebly blade runner pads waft through the steely air closer is paradoxically enough the most rhythmically dynamic track an almost tuneless percussive free-for-all that returns to the start/stop interplay of this time repurposed to much more groove-centered upbeat effect the otherwise restrained use of the 303 throughout the ep is a mark of judicious craft it can be assumed that a fair amount of good sense is useful in staying the hand that turns the filter and resonance knobs especially when you know how little it takes to crank it up until it starts shattering wine glasses here only just enough room is given to the chalkboard-scrape of the infamous 303 hi-freq screech before reining it back in again only in the final seconds of this outro track is the 303 finally given space for the full range of its uppermost register but in an airless and relieved sigh
s third album for his own label sees him drifting from the modern aesthetic of made within the upper stairs of and toinen towards more vintage flavours of house just take a look at the tracklist and its opening cut titled inc ironically as much as this kind of thing may seem the product of a veterans sentimentality has been djing since the 80s in the current retro-crazed climate one could also say hes keeping with the times albeit in a more sincere way than most newcomers was assembled using only live takes from hardware without a computer even armed with this knowledge its hard to actually perceive it depending on your perspective this says a lot about either that hes a pretty talented musician or that hes playing it a little too safe the answer i think lies somewhere in the middle lodically tracks like and feel just as well-endowed as more carefully-sequenced peers so too are the filtered builds and gentle drops of as tight and logical as any really helps is s insistence on strong grooves from the robotic bounce of inc to the jacking pulse of or the subdued skip of the constant presence of bass keeps feeling unified as it makes small hops between styles as inc should imply chicago figures prominently though its not just about grit or soul for instance feels like one of legowelts whimsical creations while at other times the influence of detroit or the west coast seems subtly apparent through it all there is one other thing gluing the album together: simplicity i tried to reduce the music to the essentials not do too much trickery and crazy editing maybe you [can] hear it in the results said in a recent interview yes you certainly can along with the finns ability to make his machines say more than some people with flashier tools ever will
this is s second solo ep for new london label after junes characteristically mesmeric purge/enthroned story goes that the black meteoric star/crystal ark man made the lead track during an investigation into the capabilities of an analogue processor he designed as enduring as this image is (and if youve ever seen russom in command of his machines onstage youll know what i mean) the tracks 11 minutes pass without too much of note actually happening a very russom analogue bassline and clipped hats are the tracks ever-present ingredients with synth touches alternately spacey and tinkling wafting in and out of the picture its atmospheric of course but it feels like a transmission from deep within russoms comfort zone fares better named after one of the 99 names of allah its wistful keys and stuttering percussion confer an endearingly hesitant and flickering start that persists even when these ingredients gently coalesce a sleepy subtle treat it comfortably outshines the surprisingly one-dimensional a-side
is a young toulouse-based producer with a predilection for jungle hes a good fit for fledgling label a good source for all things uptempo s debut release presents breaks in several different ways vintage house jungle idm breakcore over its nine stuffed-to-the-gills tracks it paints a picture of a producer with endless ideas is split between house on one side and spastic percussive workouts on the other five old-school tracks on the a-side feel anonymously trendy and belie the imagination on the b-side you might align their fuzzy fidelity with the likes of ross from friends or you could compare them to breaky efforts from project pablo and plo man s personality shows in is his hummingbird-like attention span se songs take left turns almost constantly to the point that they become hard to follow first seems like low-slung boogie based around a rap sample but then it morphs into decadent piano house before the breaks come in its fun but disorienting as if couldnt figure out where to take the track (or when to stop) it makes makes the a-side feel giddy but also unfocused rough ever-shifting is better capturing the thrill of a rollercoaster rather than throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks freed of the 4/4 goes haywire on the b-side res s nine-minute idm flight the atmospheric jungle of and the ten-minute breakcore blitz latter cushioned by celestial synths is undoubtedly the highlight along with the other three tracks on the flipside pairs retro knowledge with youthful ingenuity it points towards a new artist still figuring out the best way to express himself but with the energy and skills to get him there
what if you made a classic record and no-one heard it what if you made a bunch m t least jon derosas 000 debut as very fine indeed no solace in sleep was relatively acclaimed that album is certainly striking given that derosa was struggling to cope with underwater experience and auditory hallucinations brought on by permanent nerve damage-inflicted loss hearing in his right ear even better was his 00 contribution to darla records bliss out series or you could just go through your whole life and be happy nyway moving away from glacial droning guitar ambience thats ei r derosas specialty or cross to bear that album saw him embracing electronics and song structure to same ends as his more expressly ambient albums s music has ploughed fertile grounds between those two poles ever since but s (yes a pun on terry rileys seminal n c ; derosa also names a track after his teachers lamonte and marian zazeela while were playing inside baseball) marks starkest lp since no solace in sleep and maybe best one hes ever done this time its just derosa some guitars something called a bilhorn telescopic pump organ and a lot time and space ts amazing what he can conjure up with such basic ingredients: is as surgingly optimistic as no is quietly mournful as were is contorted with remorse as ce) is majestically remote and so on the two vocal tracks here should be easiest to parse but closing cover danzigs demon transmutes a song that was frankly kind silly into something genuinely sobering in its self-examination and lovely makes a narrative out retreat both sonic (those unwinding reversed guitar lines) and lyrically (its almost entirely about withholding judgment) both songs are welcome additions but y function almost as signposts sticking out wintry bulk a little something to help you get your bearings for most part youre instead confronted with marvels like eight minutes derosas best approximation what its like to be inside his head that proves to be a disorienting but strangely peaceful place although unlike derosa listener always has option turning f s good as graceful arc this albums gentler tracks are its a good thing that derosa varies things more than he has in past with shorter punchier onward and marking out territory somewhere between brighter sides eluvium and durutti column the result is both a kind clearinghouse what derosa can do and a masterclass in why hes great now people just need to start paying attention
shocker of the year: s turn at the fabric helm is great sorry to anyone betting the long odds that it might end up otherwise on fabric is such a fitting match its basically the reeses pieces of club mixes like a number of previous fabric mixers it seems like matt edwards had it in his mind to pay a bit of tribute to the london landmark and the sound a kind of deep rolling boil that manages to sound locked in place yet flush with movement at the same time would seem to have an ideal home in the fine tuned space cave that is fabric room s for what awaits you here hope you like tribal beats because youre headed for a jungle plunge result is a stream of dense percolating tracks upbeat and impassioned brimming with insistent conga flutter and bursts of tin folk singing n abundance of nimble complex rhythms provides fertile ground for floating samples like the tantalizing ribbons of piano on remix of s one of three times shows up here he opens the set with another equally distinctive remix and appears towards the close with which youve no doubt heard dropped by basically everyone since the winter music conference such a selection might elicit a groan from those whose ardent love for dance music invites an obsessive relation to novelty more than other genres dance music accentuates the unique joy of getting lost in a tune youve never heard before and this can make the prospect of hearing again a tad unexciting but what would a rainforest house mix be without it while the tune may feel a bit worn now its presence here along with a few other tried and true bangers paradoxically ensures the mix a longer shelf life imagine how good it will still sound three years from now rest assured though there are still a number of fresh revelations to be found here including an unreleased rs gem dont a for and the recent addition whose seductively deadpan vocals on n ss are a mix standout more tunes culled from rss own catalog further flesh out the sense of mazonian adventure: see the tribal remix of by which barrels like a freight train through an underbrush haunting vocals hanging like flashes of sunlight through the canopy and steve s mix of a welcome kin to the template ll of these contribute to a well executed expression of the / sound in vividly evoking a style in a particular moment in time but without coming across as overtly topical s a mix for right now but also it seems easily capable of withstanding obsolescence even if rainforest house doesnt make it to 2010 odds are youll be playing this one long after other fabric installments have passed their expiration date
wolfgang voigt has adhd as a child i didnt go to the kindergarten because i felt disturbed by all the noise of other children he told dr chris dooks in a 0 interview it was the same later in school i hated to go there he didnt know it at the time but these were early symptoms of hypersensitivity a condition he identified only as an adult in the early 000s he tried medication the dulling effects of which he couldnt stand but soon turned to books for alternate views on the disorder he discovered that the problem might not necessarily be with him the fault is in the social constructs like school and work which werent made to support such uncontrollable or nonconformist dispositions apart from that voigt explained after school in the afternoon everything was fine when i could dive into my childhood fantasy world no wonder he started forest retreats have inspired everyone from bon iver to biosphere for voigt they were therapeutic the now -year-old artist grew up in a family with deep appreciation for the natural landscape surrounding their home city of cologne voigt spent much of his youth escaping into the nearby k nigsforst as a hippie teen he had his first psychedelic experiences there and the place made such an impression on him that he named his third album after it when i released k nigsforst he told dooks i knew the record [had] much more of my very personal emotional inner worlds than any of my records ever before but honestly i was not really aware about how much this was the case when i made the record personally i learned to understand the effect of the record many years and 000 interesting [responses] later now years after mille plateaux released k nigsforst voigts own label once again reissues the album as part of a huge box set celebrating the legacy of even without considering that 00 s nah und fern which compiled all four albums onto four cds and two abridged lps has been long out of print is a welcome release if the creator of this music can find new meaning and context for his work decades later surely his dedicated fanbase deserves another reason to revisit without 99 s modern ep and the self-titled debut album from 99 this collection captures the era when was a fully realized conceptual project that wanted to merge the sublimity of nature with the freedom of the club little of this is news to the countless people who have already dug deep into voigts highly influential catalog of ambient techno but puts this music in a new light in part by inviting intentional and chronological listening theres a journey to be heard thats in keeping with the musics concept from the looming expanse of 99 s through to the last and most peaceful record 000s this may be meditative music made with vaporous samples of wagners strings and the elegant hypnosis of kosmische artists like klaus schulze but its patterns and pulses take on lives of their own a peak such as k nigsforst feels monumental after trekking through s labyrinthine trails emerging onto the dawn-lit vista of k nigsforst and basking in the warmth of k nigsforst immersed in s tranquil hallucinations you get an idea of how voigt felt as a kid escaping the chatter of society to listen to the forests whispers for the uninitiated is as much a history lesson in minimal and ambient techno as its a musical odyssey as voigt explained to dooks the full effect of couldnt be realized until well after his project faded into memory the ripples of its impact have yet to dissipate from tim heckers sample-based ambient music and the fields from here we go sublime to voices from the lakes self-titled masterpiece and acronyms june and a reissue like this will help them continue to spread in his 00 review of a rare performance philip sherburne said the point of isnt the moment or the riff; its the totality seems to ratify the statement presenting the core of voigts enduring gift to electronic music as canon yet whats more remarkable now than the influence and rich backstory of is its mutability over a decade since this music first appeared theres little about it that feels nostalgic worlds this sumptuous and vast dont so much hook the listener with superficial memorabilia as they penetrate to a deeper reflective headspace the flutes and strings that waft through sounded as old and intangible in 9 as they do now the bass notes as subliminal the beat as gentle fluid and reassuring s light krautrock guitar will always flutter with psychedelic harmony as we change this sort of music can change along with us but for sure there is another side which is much more personal and cannot be completely explained voigt told dooks describing a little-discussed aspect of in his undiagnosed mental state voigt found his creative process to help me to concentrate or to balance myself that sense of relief and the joy that comes from such self-discovery is at the heart of these records is the sound of a man freeing his mind and allowing it to wander to listen to is to seize that same opportunity
the two aussies in phil k vance musgrove team up to deliver the latest release on lobotomoy records by the name of the original mix is quite a unique and intricate breaks production that uses some very unconventional drum patterns as well as some tasty bass riffs there are some very nice melodies and atmospheric effects that make the production flow very smoothly and all in all it showcases the smoother styles of phil and vance s work kriece gets in on the act with his remix on the flipside and he adds a pretty tasty techy edge to the release using some very solid basslines and twisted sounds and effects much like the a-side the track has a very smooth flow and thanks to the basslines it has a very tasty chunky feel to it it s a quality remix from kriece that adds to a very solid release from lobotomy
congratulations you are now the owner of the worlds most popular number one hit record declares a natty english voice seconds into s latest 12-inch for lunar disko receipt the minute-long monologue is titled eager to poke fun at himself yet again its actually the artist jonny dillon speaking (his previous record for lunar disko was titled in it for the money ) strange terrain holds similar fare to its predecessor offering four joyous synth excursions first mh r has more than a touch of todd terje about it blooping arps springing gleefully atop a bubbly low-end and the occasional snare break dillons arrangement feels even more childishly chaotic however jostling for attention each of his motifs pull in a slightly different direction but all deliver a magical ride is similarly buoyant this time buttressed by robotic bass and hiding a twanging 303 in its brilliantly-lit folds slick and fast the seems like another attempt at self-deprecation or maybe the title just refers to the song itself which certainly recalls a time when electronic music was na ve and idealistic built around a driving bassline its utterly anthemic dropping to a filtered break midway and then dramatically returning to its harold faltermeyer-esque refrain rounds out the incredibly strong release possessed by an early-morning bleariness it feels a bit like najem sworbs recent particules except this time rolling toms rather than kicks tumble under the dreamy bloops
free gherkin vol 1 is the first joint record from detroits li erger and ostons deviere erger is an up-and-comer whose house and techno surges with energy productions are clean and the colors are boosted by bright synths or raunchy vocals deviere is an under-the-radar producer and lifelong radio dj who works with strange textures and doesnt seem restricted by the dance floor with their strengths intertwined they present an impressive ep that speaks both to body and mind oth tracks are long and swirling journeys with hard rhythms tucked into a hazy atmospheres is as its name suggests over ten minutes it stretches through galaxies with glowing ambience marching drum patterns and a soulful sax solo that drifts sleepily in and out also begins with sci-fi drifting but it gets more sinister when the kick comes it picks up a gut-busting bassline growling chords and an unholy acid line y then it should have the dance floor bucking

makes me think of the characters omar little from the wire and bronn from game of thrones they never seem to be on screen for long enough but when they are its always unforgettable this dutch artist has similarly left us wanting more it says a lot that the yearning for his music is the product of a single album 2013s i am woman and two eps the first of which came out in 2004 he now returns like a blast from littles 44 magnum with an ep for boddikas nonplus label which isnt to say is built through force these three tracks span 40 bpm and a broad emotional range the common thread being a creeping sense of mischief a remnant of a time long past says star trek s notorious khan in the title tracks opening passage genetically engineered to be superior so as to lead others to peace in a world at war outside of 90s drum bass i usually cringe at movie dialogue in club tracks but the way in which weaves the malevolent voice through baggy drums plucked bass and filmic atmospheres is mesmeric also achieves cinematic moods by way of a 140-bpm techno track its busy arrangement borders on irritating but this simply makes its mellow moments more satisfying the sudden drop into twinkling keys around the two-minute mark is pure bliss pulls the same trick on with equally impressive results set against jazzy drums and sampled speech he cycles through scratchy piano loops before hollowing things out midway a simple decision that makes the track pop theres enough magic in to last until next enters the frame
full house of unknowns here: both the anonymous producer and the label are at the time of writing yet to leave their stain on google but the four tracks on the debut for both artist and label have been catching the ear of harder uk techno djs and its easy to see why in particular owes much to the industrial techno canon is entirely proficient at the form theres a neat feint after the breakdown which makes the return of the distorted kicks all the more satisfying but he does little to elevate himself above the many other artists treading these boards in is less aggro but more acutely hallucinatory; the pleasure is observing the way its single-note melody twists in the murk is built on trilling snares in the vein of plastikmans spastik though they never quite emerge preferring to lurk at the edge of focus is the obligatory beatless track its ghostly reverberance and sub-bass throb sounding like well plenty of other moody soundscape pieces on techno 12-inches in recent months
the first release from cc nots geo fi gave listeners a lot to think about if you spend your life up to your ears in dance music the way the berlin/vancouver trio set things askew was tantalizing its rare that a record sounds so wonderfully wrong on a new ep from berlin-based cc not affiliate it feels like are putting the house back in order that makes it a more immediate pleasure though no less intoxicating on paper the tracks themselves arent wildly unique built from hissing ambience extra-wide kicks pad stabs and pockets of breakbeat they bring to mind the dreamier side of sex tags mania and yet the compositions themselves stand apart on the a-side and function as one epic piece moving from wound-up syncopation to straighter tenser 16th-note clicks from the shifting decay on the sub-bass to the proliferating fauna in the ambient bed s every move sounds deliberate but not overwrought confident but not self-congratulatory is both airier and harder-hitting the eps pads show up shaved down to a wisp but its drums have been turbocharged thrusting us headlong into the rave for an instant impossibly those pads win out and for a good three minutes it feels like floating in the ocean with a massive hangover you cant quite stitch a thought together but theres no place youd rather be
one third of leeds-based production crew transmission collective s brand of house may be soulful and warm but its far from light and fluffy in fact its got a tough leathery underbelly on the surface is sweet shimmering deepness with a floaty vocal (sampling floetrys say yes ) but underneath theres wiry taut bass and crunchy claps keeping it cheeky like fellow 90s house aficionados bicep s other offering wallows in crashing jersey-style drums and quaking bass keys then upholds the collective idyll by sharing out the remixes to his two fellow transmissioners with kahweh handing in a sparkling transmission in dubby swaggering house with his remix of wolf adopts a more plaintive approach dousing in subtle echo ukg riddims woodblocks and sparsely-sown sonic booms all-round a robust little package
its probably not a shock to say but: it must be different over there in germany s one of the few unrepentant doors fans left among my age group in merica it was a surprise to put on s latest 12-inch and hear samples taken from multiple songs from the groups catalogue the problem with the doors has always been jim morrisons pretentious lyrics so reinhold does the obvious thing on the -side: he eliminates them almost altogether instead wraps tinkling keyboard samples meandering cymbal washes a disembodied yelp and rain-soaked atmosphere from the groups riders on the storm the only thing that might not be taken from the group is the insistent bassline and kick that holds the thing together s a pastiche of doors samples its beautiful and borderline amazing s a standalone house track it holds its own as a quirky little tune perfect for late night plays oulevard seems to take less from the instrumental side of the doors the bass kick and main riff (a wobbly rotating synth that remains deliciously off-kilter throughout) are modern-sounding elements here though morrison appears twice albeit hardly recognizable hes the chanting man youll be pressed to understand moaning about angels dancing and angels dying musically the song is less enthralling or even functional than its predecessor but it still retains the same mysterious otherworldliness that the best doors tracks evoke as well gain for more adventurous djs this will work wonders on a floor at 5 a m with morrisons ghostly vocals leading the way
is a new techno label based in berlin its first record comes from a wide-ranging japanese musician who these days is a key part of tokyos deep techno scene ep is dedicated to dave twomey the much-loved artist behind the tokyo party and label mariana (which igarashi was often a part of) who passed away last year and it has igarashi continuing to smooth out his style through four nuanced and atmospheric productions is anchored by two-beat syncopated drums and filled with fizzing drones and bubbling effects its mellow and contemplative while on the flip turns up the intensity this one features some sharp-edged cymbal and hi-hat work and an anxious offbeat rattle making it the records toughest most floor-ready track other two tracks are pitched around 110 bpm is at first simple and spacious little more than some loose 4/4 percussion and sparse melodic toots but together a warm 303 riff and some exquisitely airy pads are gradually brought into the mix if seemed like it was cruising ever higher into the sky finishes the record by floating out into space among hazy beeps and woozy sci-fi sounds but there is a destination or at least a port of call in one final buildup of evocative synths
the breaks master dee kline is back in full effect with wizard a couple of guests in tow on this pair of mixed up gems first up is truth is a lie fronted by spoonface of black legend fame it has a strong street sound and a powerful bass / breaks combination the vocal at times bringing dizzee rascal to mind but with an obviously older voice in charge dee kline keeps up the old school references with the rushing synths in the mid foreground b-side is mj coles remix of ill st blues a surprisingly up tempo cut n paste number this features yolanda described as aretha franlin on acid (acid soul anyone ) ironically its less soulful than coles normal sound bouncing along with a restless energy both tracks reward repeat plays and offer the promise that dee klines forthcoming album will be worth checking out
move over lisa lashes theres a new girl in town magda too had better watch her back because its her weaponry in use and san franciscan scarlett etienne wields it like a pair of nunchakas put it better: she is damn good-looking and her tracks are rocking like hell female producers might still be a novelty but wed be better off without this sexist blather ironic or not help comes from london duo audiofly the weapons in question are the blips and bits of magnifying-glass minimal techno and its a language in danger of becoming codified into blandness fortunately theres producers like etienne and audiofly around laying down trump cards and revealing life in the old dog yet the two tracks on succeed by combining standard minimal intricacy with a brash immediacy a-side loose limbs sync ships starts with a bubbling bassline before tidy tiny clicks whirrs and gurgles dance in complex formations around the stereo spectrum soon were spun off course with four rising analogue tones wound in and out of focus by deft adsr twiddling these become the dominant focus until midway through at four minutes a whole new tune emerges one filled with contrasting competing bouncing tones its like m-nus colliding with trapez kambuca on the b-side uses a similar palette and follows a similar trajectory but still manages a few surprises in place of as insectoid chatter is a melody/rhythm tapped out on plastic bottles and claves a sweeping drone and little aqueous burps and echoes the shift this time comes from a marimba drained of sustain and thicker daubs of electronic tone these two squabble amid the detail before things wind up after seven and a half minutes both tracks are firmly of the less-is-more school and dont aim for euphoria but the restless detours and use of incongruous blunt sounds lift this safely above the rabble
despite their mastery of house music everything steve ug cl churn out when put in a room together has a distinct acid flavour their first go around on poker flat back in 07 the silicon allet ep set the precedent and now with their second full single release the ep they hold true to form on the the duo initially lull listeners into a false sense of comfort and warmth with an unassuming tech house beat ug and cl s patented old-school drums are expectedly present but theres nothing to indicate where this track eventually gets to until the first melody creeps in then it all gets a bit ravey menacing staccato groove soon gets overtaken by multiple layers of overwrought strings that manage to create a sense of euphoria coupled with an unshakable feeling of unease at the same time the melodies are sharp and although cushioned with sweeping pads for the most part never try to be warm and welcoming stays at the rave its a groove piece holding tightly to a mid-90s aesthetic driven incessantly by firecracker percussion and snapping hats simple in its delivery it counteracts the intentional iciness of and replaces it with a warmer rhythm

a original b nathan fake s night in mix do you ever wonder what goes through the mind of a dj what s he thinking what drives him to play a certain sound and why do they always like to fvck around with your mind for it s been his passion of underground dance music - playing in front of people making them dance making them embrace one another and making them understand that even the most tribal of sounds can make you lose your feet on the floor he just lets the sweat and sexual energy speak through the dark drums in his latest single steve s original mix is deep tribal house just the way you want it it s a peak-hour track that never drives itself off course with tough drums cementing the pace comes the soundscape of warning sirens just for the added fear of the inevitable you can sense something s coming something s building and it s coming straight for you it s dark dirty with a sight tease of electro for good measure as the breakdown ensures it introducing the main melody as it collides within itself and breaks free into burning rhythms to finish the track off it s all about technique with nathan fake s mix wanting to stay in for the night nathan overdubs the original with fake-style marching it s like being the mad hatter but without the drugs melodies cut up to click with a peaking snare that crashes in along with acid licks that doesn t let go along comes the glitchy percussion that fires off an inferno of delayed out melodies from a mind that s argent and cool all at the same time it s amazing to hear how groovy this sounds nathan just soaks you in acid; you don t know if you should shake that booty or go completely ape he certainly establishes a unique ride that s floor-filling gooeygoodness but evil too i love it the original is brooding with liquid grooves and nathan s remix is a tech-monster we all want a good night out and steve just helped us get one even closer
s take on house music is nothing if not distinctive: pitting the rhythmic adventurism of the urrell rothers with the uplift of disco all stitched together in arrangements as detailed as any contemporary plug-in tweaker the erliner forges a bounce all of his own rush hour who released his very fine obos lone in paradise single from 2010 seems like the perfect fit for music so equally situated between yesterday and tomorrow; his follow-up for the label takes quite a similar stance though his sound design continues to keep things interesting while you usually know when you hear him he has a knack for keeping things fresh so while both inclusions here were apparently pulled from a backlog of older material neither is likely to sound like a facsimile of something youve heard before the slower of the two inclusions packs a curious punch: ebullient percussion rides a zappy 303 through sections that can be both headily melodic and sparsely down-to-business feels more paranoid and manic though the producer still manages to leave plenty of space for a forceful kick to cut through the mix (some of his percussion flourishes here sound like they may have been pulled from the same source as those in roman fl gels rasil though doesnt take the elements in quite as deranged a direction ) with properly new material supposedly on the way once again sets the bar high though he gives little indication of where his studio chops might go next
i will always be there for you wafts the vocal on returning to s irresistible comfort zone prior to this 12-inch william evan had been edging outside of his on sweetz this years collaboration with zomby and 2015s temple sleeper released on keysound an unusual urgency emerged oth tracks failed to convey the urban filigree that evan has previously sculpted with such care so feels like a gentle resetting of the course begins with the spark of a lighter and then ushers you into an unusual time of day for : sunrise set against wispy choral tones and shimmering chimes the vocals sound crisp and cool later a homespun arpeggio casts more daylight onto the music free of s usual fog the tracks opening segment feels cleansing when it takes a downcast turn in the last two minutes however something isnt right sounding more like a shadow of a tune compared to the quiet post-rave moments of previous records retreats even further from the dance floor on film dialogue (possibly from lien ) and a lade runner -esque synth channel sci-fi and computer games rather than pirate radio its rendered in neon instead sharing the -sides optimism and glow ut in resisting the euphoric surges of kindred and rival dealer both tracks lack a certain quality there are moments of hymnal beauty but its unmoored from the hardcore nostalgia of evans most affecting music the context for is harder to grasp and before you know it it drifts away
im sure that paper se remixers would get anybody reas able wetting mselves with joy nd with inclusi of ellen llien and pparat resp sible for last years genius orchestra of bubbles i would have agreed with m las ory doesnt always square with practice and this ep proves somewhat of a letdown from o rwise high class operators ellen llien and pparats remix of and s fires spectacularly into mediocrity it hints at delicate beauty y are capable of yet frustratingly never comes close to it the fact that track is given a minimal berlin-sound style makeover is initially encouraging but pair have used little of ir copious inventi and talent to differentiate it from hundreds of o r similar tracks reverberating round trendy warehouses in cities across world disappointing hoover house maestro surkins rework of is like almost every o r surkin remix: chopped up baile funk style vocals mor ic bleeping and a farty bassline the rave stabs at end are cool but overall its pretty forgettable it falls to dave to lift things up his versi of is a fantastic piece of electro funk with beats that sound like yre ground out by pist s im not sure if his name is a reference to simian mobile disco track the but this track a similar feel and musically its a par too the tiny disco string inserts also remind you of busy ps more fun disco shenanigans like his remix of whats your name gain rainbow man ep which cant be a bad thing
when you become as big a dj as it can be hard to find the time to actually make music and for a while there it looked like the globetrotting artists well of original material had run dry last year troxler finally broke the drought releasing a series of collaborations and starting a whopping three labels across a few months which hinted at a renewed creativity on guy gerbers label is another milestone: its troxlers first solo track in years you can hear all sorts of ideas rubbing up against each other in theres a heavy-lidded hot creations feel a minimal-influenced arrangement and a collage of transient sounds but they never quite combine in a convincing way its admirably weird with plonking piano and a sea of chattering voices but those touches cant keep from feeling a little average mathew jonson and heartthrob tease out the tracks fun side bolstering it with a walking disco bassline that gives it a wonderfully crooked feel in a rather mean-spirited april fools prank troxler posted a selfie of himself with martin garrix joking about collaborating with the young edm producer as if the idea were absurd judging from he couldve used some of garrixs youthful energy

if you spent any time clubbing in berlin or london circa 2007 then s fourth album will sound immediately familiar its richly evocative of that point where minimal techno morphed into playful strung-out minimal house watergate was closely associated with that psychedelic sound; you can understand why theyre releasing whats odd is that ali and basti schwarz are making such music now when at the time they were still releasing relatively muscular tech house little about suggests the brothers schwarz have a natural proclivity for the counterintuitive leaps of imagination that made minimal house so addictive the disembodied brass samples that float across the functionally brooding fail to surprise the collaborations with vocalist sound like they are grasping after and failing to capture the jazz-tinged delirium that made dops early work compelling likewise featuring hovers in that moody anti-diva territory that cassy once made her own without truly committing the central problem here (one even bigger than the banality of s lyrics) is not that sounds like a record brought out of cryogenic suspension but that seem incapable of letting go there is a rigidity in their approach a thickness in their basslines and a chunkiness to the synths and pads that suggests that deep down they still want to make dramatic electro-tinged house which could be an old tiga tune and a fantastic juxtaposition of whirring electronics and a melancholy melody are the best tracks here sounds like a record caught between those two worlds and one fundamentally out of time
a lethal concoction of electro breaks punk house and tek (at least thats whats stated on the cover) is the mix compilation cd which feels like it should have been released twenty years ago - mixed by none other than local heroes the wok djs (made up of hussle head honcho declan lee and tim mcgee) on the first cd and the very versatile ajax on cd 2 cd 1: punk house dirty breaks mixed by wok djs goldfrapps train sets the first cd in locomotion and goldfrapp have done well to give the tune a real chug-a-long feel thanks in part goes to the swingtime beats and clever female vocals from one well done tune to a really crap one whats up with those vocals on tigas cover of nellys hot in herre tiga have turned the anthemic neptunes produced tune into something of a jackin 2-stepper (with a little hint of their justin timberlake beats) yet ruined it completely with lame vocals moguai are represented yet again and theres no surprise that both u know y and the rock appear in the mix this time however the wok mash em both up with acapellas green velvets genedefekt sits on the same theme that made la la land such a popular tune - dark techno beats and twisted vocals - sidling up alongside it is the more lighthearted way of life by stylophonic featuring the vocal stylings of digital underground continuing on the hip-house theme is mekons one hit from 2000 - whats going on featuring the rhyme styles of roxanne shante with junior cartier on a house remix tip whereas basement jaxx go all ragga house on their classic hold ya lighta - before they got signed to xl records bad cabbage gets rude on their tune your rude (get fucked) which i personally think is just another tune that will ride off the success of its title and nothing else while audio bullys dont seem to give a fuuuuuuuuu k on their punk/house hybrid we dont care kid creme brings back the hip house on the four to the floor thump on down and under and felix da housecats silver screen - shower scene still retains its classic status and makes for a welcome inclusion here andrew kornweibel and tony neal form presser and their tune radio gets cooked up by the wok into an 80s disco/electro affair and its good to see the locals getting represented on local compilations cd 2: retro tek mixed by ajax whether hes playing tech house hip hop or breaks ajax is known for mixing it up in style at the same time pulling out the bootlegs which add a certain degree of spice to a mix (sometimes they are known to spoil the recipe too ) ajax kicks off his mix with what feels like a electronic synthesiser version of jimi hendrixs star spangled banner this time done by mr negative right before gary numan sings about cars - i was just a baby when this baby first came out and yet it still rocks dancefloors to this day considering the mix is called retro tek this is the only tune which goes back farther than 3 or 4 years - its hardly retro sunship remix basement jaxxs jus 1 kiss into a subtle 2-step reworking and detroit grand poobahs sandwiches gets mashed up by ajax to include both the krafty kuts remix and the sleazy detroit tek of the original - nice sean kosa keeps the electro vibes going on rent is due while tube and bergers wunderbar is just of those tunes that breaks and house djs cant seem to get enough of someone that definitely deserves to be on this cd is les rhythmes digitales considering his love for 80s disco and synthesisers and disco ii disco makes for a fine inclusion before ajax brings the tempo down for grand popo football clubs men are not nice guys - laidback jazzy beats and a sassy female on vocals i could almost believe her if i wasnt a nice guy myself still on the female vocals tip is the melancholy seventeen by ladytron seelenlufts manila is fast becoming one of the must have tracks on any compilation for ewan pearson remixes it into an electro tek number and keeps the 12 year old rappers vocals in there overall some pretty good mixes from both the wok and ajax but theres nothing really new here - there are plenty of other cds with similar tracks on them (how many cds am i going to listen to with that manilla tune on it even more so with satisfaction u know y and the rock ) - but ajax and the wok djs give the cd a little bit of 80s personality albeit one that wears acid wash denim and white reeboks for those who like a little retro flavour to their music is the perfect compilation you can find it in your record store - its the one which looks like its wearing too much white face make up messy pink lipstick and thick black eyeliner
when borrowed marshall mcluhans famous maxim the medium is the message he was using it to justify his commitment to vinyl but his point that the music you release is inseparable from the way in which you release it has broader applications vincent has been a revered figure in house and techno for years now y album but particularly a long-awaited debut from such a well-liked artist will bring with it new expectations this new medium implies a new grander statement finally the artist can speak in complete paragraphs rather than the short sharp sentences of a dance floor 12-inch but vincent has always packed plenty of verbiage into his singles even his simplest tracks are witty reactions to house and techno convention full of stylish turns of phrase and vivid colloquialisms borrowed from both his native new york and his adopted home of berlin wisely he doesnt try to out-talk himself on his self-titled debut instead he subtly shifts the terms of the discussion presenting a message that is better suited to the medium even if its not quite as well-suited to vincents skill set often it feels like the transformation was as simple as nudging around a few faders on the mixing desk a cryptic roller out of the joey derson playbook picks up a full arrangement of drums as it goes but theyre kept way back in the mix likewise rest in peace whose gorgeous clouds of melody dominate its barely-there groove repeatedly percussion is used as little more than a timekeeper while an array of synths and strings do the hard work drifts by like an early autechre cut s gaunt bassline recalls vincents floor-focussed fear but its content to nod along in breakdown mode at first this can be underwhelming you might find yourself hoping for an enormous kick drum to thunder into view sweeping all of those pretty melodies into a pitch-black abyss in the manner of so many vincent classics even the more straightforward tracks tend to have a smeared quality as in tha whose airy groove is clogged with strange reverbs or strasse whose aggro churn is a little too blunted to really hit home still is the albums only weak moment others while never delivering the thrills of six figures or solemn days slowly reveal a different kind of charm by the time we get to w/ wolf and vincent has perfected his new style: richly arranged tuneful sentimental but not quite saccharine so much so that when he returns to more familiar sounds on the home stretch it doesnt feel quite appropriate ti corporate and the closer gel are all fantastic but without them the albums arc seems clearer: a slow but steady ascent up that launch ramp into the sky
they might share a birthplace in toronto but until recently adam marshall and christian andersen seemed to share little common ground musically the former was best-known for house and techno of a deeper hue which he djs produces and releases on his label; the latter for the dubstep and jungle-indebted bass music he fashioned as xi yet in the past few years andersen seemed to be edging toward marshalls territory both musically with the somnolent house of his ambalance project and physically with a move to berlin marshalls adopted home its there that the pair met and decided to collaborate as before andersen upped sticks back to toronto with the first fruits of their union released last spring of course these days the notion of a bass artist making 4/4 or vice-verse is likely to raise more shrugs than eyebrows with a few exceptions the squelchy and stuttering or the ambient vistas of feels mostly like a techno album with even the depth-charge bass of its heaviest moment ( ) erupting within a 4/4 framework yet the way marshall and anderson construct their beats has clearly been informed by bass that technique and tempo creates a space where it feels as if the duo are taking time to explore each others styles rather than just leaping in headlong together it also gives the album a certain moody tinge for all its dramatic stabs still seems sombre and morose the low rumbles and bittersweet vocal snippets of could be a rougher falty dl and s rising synth tones would sound euphoric if they were slightly sped up but instead they feel strung-out and elegantly wasted theres a definite sense of restraint at work here avoid any predictable drops and their beats often seem poised on the brink of full-on club mode without ever going all the way but by holding just a little back now they definitely leave you wanting to hear more from them in the future

roman fl gels music defies pigeonholing since the early 90s his recordings have glimmered with an almost neurotic attention to detail and an elegant touch with melody which has allowed him to maintain relevance amidst whatever genre was currently in vogue with the curious manner in which his pointillist sounds coalesce into graceful forms any headphone experience with his best productions is a leap down the musical rabbit-hole in 2011 fl gel released fatty folders an album characterized by a noted lack of formulaic pursuits shuffling from elegant house like how to spread lies and with blue to gorgeous nu-kosmische like krautus or the acidic squalls and simmering heat of improvisor now fl gel returns with and surprise surprise the album finds him once again deconstructing and reconfiguring house techno and the lighter pop tones of 90s electronica into brainy often hypnotic hybrids that both soothe and transplant the listener on close inspection its almost distracting how much is slithering and slinking beneath the steady pulse of each track opener is a staggering bit of ambient its soft blurry drones offsetting an insistent industrial churn is more hectic with deep synths throbbing against a twitchy beat and off-kilter video-game bleeps irdly unhinged blurts of synthetic noise are scattered across with its airy synth-gurgle sounds like it was designed for the pop mbient series until it slowly shrugs itself to life ll drifts and bobs in currents of slow warbling tones and translucent pads nd yet across this ever-transforming musical landscape you always feel escorted along by an expert guide sequencing is superb for such a genre-defying album is a work of impressive coherence and of an artist some 20 years into his career still very much at the peak of his powers
after records for clone jack for daze and my favorite robot berlins joins tigas with another ep of classically-minded house is winsome and wistful with cool organ tones underpinning a lilting string melody and a hushed voice intoning a kind of one-person call-and-response: economys going down / / societys going down / dance its a nice twist on house musics imperative tense couched in traditional tones but tuned specifically to the tenor of the present day (also nice whether or not its intentional is the way the lyrics gradually slip out of time against the rhythm ) its to finds jax taking up his ongoing affair with the 303 muttering the titular phrase over a squiggling acid line and faintly cinematic chords that lend extra depth; 8bit grinds along at 108 bpm with the sort of growling arpeggios and soft analog leads somewhere between vangelis and cr me organization the lone outlier takes up kompakts old cry to bring trance back with fat dotted-eighth chords glowing like the coils of some inscrutable machine remixes come from matt the throne of blood labels populette and freak the latters mix isnt as freaky as their excellent nano kids for rush hour but its nonetheless a white-knuckled ride through delayed toms and helter-skelter blips populette blow into a shivering bright deep house/acid hybrid while and give its to a spellbinding percussive workout a jagged boneyard of desiccated drums and bloody 303s if youve got a long night ahead of you and limited space in your record bag you really cant go wrong with this: seven tracks seven moods its a seven-sided die with serious hit points
we hear hordes of new music that sounds retro these days painstakingly retro much of the time but something sounds off about s rendering of his namesake obsession too laidback to really elicit much jacking the five grooves on reynoldss first for new yorks proudly off-kilter label really wouldnt be acid at all if he didnt have a 303 in his arsenal in its heart of hearts is a chill out record something to throw on as your brain reboots late on a sunday morning first up is summer with a sweetly uplifting melody that emanates from somewhere a solid half-mile behind its zappy (if relatively rote) bassline cruisin does away with bass altogether propelled instead by vaguely electro drums and a melody that seems to leap out from a faded photograph you found in your parents attic for whatever reason im guessing its got something to do with their unedited feel the next two tracks are both called the first has without question the most alluring feel of anything on this record though over the course of seven-and-a-half minutes its cloyingly static: its intricately fidgeting drums and lively 303 line are thoroughly engaging but those same three churchbell-ish chords played ad nauseum are not the second could also use some paring down though its runtime doesnt sabotage it to quite the same extent regardless both tracks could have lent some of their minutes to (or taken some lessons) from the spritely a brief moment of clarity after some of the records more zoneout-inducing beats
mark stewart can be forgiven for waiting until september to drop his first release of the previous 12 months were some of his busiest ever largely due to his understated metanarrative full-length sees stewart in a more upbeat mode like label mate mlz it sounds like he has been listening back to old us deep house records: the title track is a smoky groover with stewart giving his own interpretation of the drugged out tones and textures of 90s house label guidance in a framework based on static glitchy percussion and a chugging dub techno rhythm bove sees stewart in moodier form as layered chords build and build over one of his trademark cavernous drum patterns and a more uptempo approach than the prevalent mood on the warehouse sessions series closing things out marks a return to the reflective mood he so effortlessly mined on metanarrative its atmospheric sounds bordering on the hymnal a motif that is becoming more and more frequent in stewarts work it rounds off a strong comeback release and suggests that has more surprises up his sleeve
i was very excited when i received my copy of it is not very often that a quality australian release graces our record stores and as soon as resident advisor released news about this cd a few weeks ago it was clearly obvious that this would be a gem of a release they sometimes say that you can t judge a book by it s cover however you can definitely judge this cd by its cover sounds from the australian underground deep dark and dirty are the inscriptions on the cover and this double cd is all that so after listening to both cd s i can honestly report that this is absolute class this showcase cd for arguably australia s finest record label convinces me that there is something magical in the air at the zt studios the first cd is an unmixed display of classic tracks none come more classic as blue s narcotik a piece of work that opened up one of the finest mix cd s ever disc 2 of sasha s san francisco global underground dirty logic by deep funk project is spine tingling stuff while asap s save the trees has that stamp of the sound hi fi bugs breakbeat classic lydian and the dinosaur is included as well as nubreed s debut hit welcome 8 incredible full length classics is the order of the day for cd1 and it represents the successful tunes of years gone by for the stable but as they say forget the past and get with the times time for cd2 to enter the ring mixed by melbourne dj and producer gab olivier this mix is not for the lighthearted it s very deep it s very dark and it s shockingly dirty but most of all it s very very good you know this is aussie made with gab olivier s very own intro a very unique australian accent proclaiming a policy of it doesn t beat around the bush for long though as it takes you through the future of this bright record label tracks by digby oliver deep funk project low pressure and more embody the sound of melbourne intricate sounds creepy baselines and chaotic drums indicate how very well produced these tracks are gab olivier furthers the credibility of this cd by mixing seamlessly as he often does not much more can be said a solid release that will no doubt receive great praise not only on our shores but overseas where is making a very credible name for themselves in stores nationwide march 18 buy australian made tracklist: cd1 - unmixed 1 narcotik blue 2 deep funk project dirty logic 3 digital mind control darkness 4 asap save the trees 5 nubreed food for thought (dark alley remix) 6 hi fi bugs lydian the dinosaur 7 nubreed rock da city (apex remix) 8 nubreed welcome cd2 - 1 gab olivier moody intro 2 kris gab addix 3 low pressure northern lights 4 digby olivier human 5 digby olivier sunshower 6 deep funk project vs austin leeds sub ritual 7 digby olivier seven stones 8 deep funk project black witch 9 jono fernandez lo runner 10 deep funk project black phunk 11 digital mind control beta proxima 7

it should come as no surprise that wove together 65 tracks for his fabric mix rguably the dutchmans career highlight came when he did much the same on balance 14 back in 9 but while that mix was a trip through ep emotive house and techno with absorbing peaks and twists this new one is a much more linear ri through soft techno s in s own pristine productions there isnt a hi hat out of place an unnecessary kick drum nor a vocal whisper that hasnt been fawned over on fabric 8 s a technical monstration of his skill and studio patience its second to none but over the course of the mix the focus on tail is almost exhausting re are so few kinks or gear changes along the way that its easy to find yourself adrift at which point it seems as if the mix could play through from any point and still not disrupt the flow microscopic ups and downs in each track soon become a tired trick but there are some moments that stand out pecifically the first minutes or so make for a pitch perfect opening passage first youre sucked into a cavernous dub chamber then an angelic acapella empties your mind before you sink into a light techno groove stitches in church bells crystalline keys and humanised vocals hes also unafraid of a teary trance pad as he works on keeping you suspen d in that moment predictably the selections from donnacha and robert work best when chopped edited and looped ad infinitum s grandly emotional offers the first break in the clouds ty minutes in and the mix has been studiously insular and heads down so the tracks radiant keys offer a welcome breath of fresh air albeit momentarily on after is back to chasing a perfectly reduced groove with slightly tougher cuts from peedy and more often a few at once its impossible to pick apart those inner workings which is itself an achievement (if not a well tested one in ) zooming out from the picture however it all looks rather less perfect
its safe to say that had a like few other techno artists fter hitting it big with last years i wanna go ang and making several appearances on s compilations the icelandic producer released a whopping three albums this year with the full support of nina kravizs red-hot label behind him those lps defined as an artist who goes far deeper than i wanna go ang fidgety idm boisterous breakbeat techno and old-school rave tracks meant all three records were varied and bursting with colour he now caps it all off with a track thats already received plenty of attention in dj sets and one that embodies what makes such a refreshing face in techno t a blazing 140 pm is far from polite though its more gleeful than aggressive the foundation is made of slowed-down drum bass with a time-stretched breakbeat tumbling at its centre sends it over the edge with an ecstatic organ riff half hardcore half classic house it ties together several different threads of rave music but in the end it sounds like an amalgam of everything did on albums like lefhanded fuqs and on plays with staccato drum samples like a proto-jungle track this time laid on top of a tough-as-nails 135- pm kick drum its not quite as exciting as but its no less trippy frantic scribbling using the fundamentals of techno if weve learned anything about this year its that he rarely colours inside the lines
innovative french producer (of budapest fame) makes a long overdue return to record stores with the latest release for frances on the original of combines all the ingredients necessary for a future club hit even including an air guitar moment the track evolves around a rock tinged melody followed by a healthy dose of cosmic hooks and leads that build up into a simultaneous vortex enclosed by male vocals an oh-so-catchy chorus then drops and should have many of the guys and girls in full air guitar motion come the end of the night the dub on this 12 is consistent with all of s past releases on other labels including crosstown rebels and kitsune music this one gets a bit more euphoric with an ever-increasing growl of twisted synths marauding samples and downright dirty grooves this latest release for definitely fits the bill for late night/early morning departures into the deeper depths of electronic music with a guitar/synth/rock edge based on the strength of these two cuts expect to hear more strong music coming from and viva the french new wave
from robert and lyric hood to big strick and generation next the midwest has produced more intergenerational family dance music projects than anywhere else this might be down to the ties soul disco and electro have to house and techno these ties are the basis of the excellent collaboration between the windy city producer tevo howard and his father having already released enduring vocal house cuts like can your find its way the howards return after a four-year hiatus with an ep for the lumberjacks in hell sister label the title cut is the most eccentric track the duo have made its melodic and rhythmic backbone is a piano skank that evokes both digital dub and chicago dream house the elder howard whos a soul singer at heart sings about love in a throaty emotional tenor the remix of theres an imposing bassline hand percussion synthetic strings and horns its like they were going for an isaac hayes live at the sahara tahoe vibe using only roland kit has poppa howard asking someone to do just that while tevo makes the most of a blurry batch of piano chords reminiscent of the rhodes on loose joints is it all over my face
likes video games the influence was all over this years sin ep as angus finlayson observed its even more obvious on the london producers stunning follow-up and another release in gobstoppers recent hot streak following records by strict face and mattwizard the two most straightforward examples of this are and each of which taps into a different side of japanese rpg soundtracks the former is mournful and contemplative as 8-bit horns bleat over a bucking trap beat s balance is always careful though his tunes are propulsive and bass-heavy the rhythm section never upends the majesty of his melodies the more ominous takes one of the most memorable themes from final fantasy vii booming bells and all and turns it into a mood piece that moves with the unmistakable stiffness of console music the other tracks share that tendency for sing-song melodies but drape themselves in the slick textures of 80s pop instead s synths tend to become the focal point overshadowing the hissing rhythms below meaning theyre good for headphones on the synths are immaculately processed silky but just a bit fuzzy floating above the rat-a-tat percussion below on theyre vaporwave-level bright and closer 2lips is almost deliriously cheerful bringing strings into the fray only is shaded darker with burnt-out leads that intertwine and unwind it might be the most traditionally grime track on the ep but even this one is built with choppy backwards snares hinting at the abstract tendencies of the boxed crew but still sounding singular the idea of mixing video-game melodies with grime isnt anything new but it sure is unique in s hands
lowtec has always been good at coloring outside the lines consider workshop the beautifully unconventional house label he runs with even tuell or his ra podcast from last year a string of ghostly downtempo curios a new ep by a mysterious outfit called is his latest curveball not least because it appears on a label he founded in the mid 90s and whose last release (an excellent split with marvin dash) dropped in 2005 while its not clear who actually is is straight out of lowtecs playbook well maybe not straight out the title track a kind of zero gravity footwork experiment would sound as at home on hyperdub as it would on workshop but despite the syncopation and soaring tempo (154 bpm) the details scream downtempo house warbling chords spacey keys an ambient intro that swallows half the track sounds more familiar with lazy chords and chirpy vocal samples layered over a chugging slo-mo groove falls somewhere between the two in tempo as well as style this one is a lovely bit of cosmic house (at a dj friendly 126 bpm) whose syncopated kick drum gives it a weightless effervescent feel whether is properly back or just stopping by is anyones guess but you have to hope theres more where this came from

it would be very difficult one imagines to locate the first producer ever to sequence a 12 by putting a poppy track on the and a dubby one on the ut like the first firestarter this unknown producer has made an inestimable contribution to humanity exemplified by s latest: big hooks up front trippy weirdness in the back it comes as the inaugural offering for a new offshoot of crosstown rebels supposedly aimed at focusing on more off-kilter edgier releases is no stranger to a big vocal one needs to recall only the minimalist monster nesrib and again tries his hand with lyrics pinched from l greens i cant get next to you nd while the good reverends repertoire is hardly groundbreaking fare for a house track the vocals on pull off the appropriation by twisting the tune into something new dominated by punchy bursts of yelps and shouts partygoers can vibe off the ecstatic energy and trainspotters can appreciate the reference underneath is at his cornflakes-crispiest rolling an often-kickless groove of dry compressed percussive pitter-patter into a tribal-tinged crowd-pleaser the intro to epitomizes the idea of the urban jungle a suspenseful three-note xylophone figure winding its way through what sounds like multiple layers of train-station ambience s the tunes reverbed atmosphere recedes shuffling frican drums seem to traipse down a concrete tunnel before the beat kicks in fully and we find ourselves in some underground realm flush with partying mole-people their goblin voices and clanging instruments weaving in and out over the deep groove miles away from the -side but still part of the same world: isnt that every -sides dream come true
are up on the mantra pedestal once again with their latest two track release on the italian based label wait is a nice smooth production that floes thanks to a smooth bouncy electro baseline a eerie vocal sample as well as some crisp but not too strong drums the track progresses thanks to some nice melodic touches and some atmospheric effects magic is a very nice production that lifts the pace a bit with some chunkier beats and an array of vocal hooks and effects the track builds very nicely as it flows with the intensity in drums and baseline activity rising throughout a pretty solid release yet again from the studios of

moving even further away from the vexd moniker a name he shared with a fellow dubstep producer roly across the industrially lauded degenerate album for the man formerly known as jamie vexd is now releasing music under the guise but while the name may be slightly different holds plenty of similarities to the in system travel ep namely the fact that the music on it is of the skewed hip-hop variety rather than the oppressively heavy soundsystem-testing dubstep type marking his move into more fluorescent climes last year with his sunday walkman mixtape for the lucky me collective which featured artists like joker zomby and darkstar alongside cannibal ox and erykah badu jamie hasnt looked back since intently developing his production work into a fusion of off-key melodies slow slumping drums and layers of sounds that are easy to lose yourself within mixing pulsing pads with stylophone leads and erratic mid-range synth torture shouldnt work in theory but is one of the best fullest and most abrasively likeable tracks to come out on or anywhere else for that matter in months its slow churning drum cycle snatches at the notion of a metronome hitting the beat that tiny bit late jerking out from underneath his cascade of textures is the beatless respite of the ep twinkling like a seaside night sky with tidal breaths and mutilated pan pipes laying a calm aura for sounding like its been made out of one sung note thats been stretched and danced across the scales bounds from a squeal to a soothing hum in an instant as jamie plys his thick joker-like bass textures around the riff erratically peppering it with playful drips of up-pitched percussion ep closer focuses itself intently on the bass tweaking out a taut manipulation of frequencies atop a slow drum knocking its synth washes and snatched vocals flitter in and out of earshot before the bass gets add and freaks over octaves skittering joyfully before jamie winds down the ep to a close using the last minute of swirls and distant flanges brilliantly to bring the mood down an excellent addition to vexds catalogue this is undoubtedly an essential release for fans of forward-thinking bass music
you might assume a label called fuckthegovernment would have a touch of indignation to it perhaps anti-establishment acid or the abrasive and authority-averse thump of dutch hardcore what you actually get is sinuous and largely forgettable techno that prides itself on its all-analogue single-sided heavyweight vinyl status its perhaps a mask for the fact it offers little creativity is a track stitched together from an array of tropes moist 303s diva screeches chuntering detroit percussion but one that feels flabby and bereft of ideas within five minutes (with another three to go) this kind of stripped-back house is having a moment with the likes of spencer parker and a resurgent radio slave especially showing that deft arrangements can do a lot with a spare palette but compared to them seems reductive and lacking any snarl
following in the footsteps of hyperdub s mysterious wunderkind producer urial whose self-titled debut lp nearly single-handedly broke dubstep to the masses last year young dutch producer s debut release on tectonic moves the format even further away from its traditional mold this time injecting it with a healthy dose of classic erlin dub techno a dash of neo-detroit soul and a distinctly dancefloor oriented aesthetic kicking off with immediately ups the ante by inching the pm a notch or two higher than the average dubstep track meanwhile where one would generally expect to find a skeletal skank of a rhythm instead rests a solid foundation of roiling percussion clinically precise cymbal rolls and stuttered synth drones tied together by a droning bassline that manages to retain the heaviness of dub but still serves to propel the track forward considering that this is out on tectonic a label known for trafficking in some of the heaviest bass emissions around it s all really rather shocking but thanks to the sparing use of hand percussion and touches of reverb the mix still retains the decidedly dark and foreboding atmosphere that typifies so much dubstep closes the single out with tastefully deployed washes of nocturnal pads and filtered keys that recall carl craig or maurizio while another stepper of a beat moves the track onward equally at home during the twilight hours or the wee hours of the morning this is by far the more accessible of the two cuts on offer here e you of a more minimal persuasion or a devotee of bass weight either one of these cuts could be easily slotted into a more adventurous dj set without risk of clearing the floor solid debut from a young producer to watch for sure
earlier this year the london-based returned with his first record in two years a soundtrack for the documentary x years in london compared to his usual bass-heavy club bombs the music was given space to breathe exploring glassy and futuristic sound palettes with beautiful results told i-d that the soundtrack was the first time hes made music for an existing visual context his latest ep v o l t / pumps a similarly cinematic sense into the club v o l t accompanied by a space opera music video is the eps bigger production the drums are thumping the leads are metallic and the climax is built on symphonic strings these theatrics provide the right kind of thrill for the eps 3d-rendered space station visual and they should have a similar impact through a club soundsystem is less flashy but more driving with an unruly sense of rhythm and precision details claps keys and giggles that shoot off in 360 degrees
darren j cunninghams first full-length under his moniker is titled and that goes a long way towards describing the tracks found on this -inch for trusmes imprint of course it doesnt hurt that two of the three tracks were licensed from that very album but -side the lone exclusive track here also fits the bill nicely riding a quick-hitting kick drum a shaker and an indistinct mass of surface hiss that ends up being the main melody cunningham pitches it up down and all around and ends up with a tune to lose yourself in is equally as indistinct its funky beat and whirling synths caught under gauze and lo-fi tape bramble the hits are muted as a result but thats part of the point with work clearly s on closer these songs dont go anywhere they simply create a headspace for you to enter into that each track sounds of a piece with one another while remaining entirely singular means that cunningham has clearly done his job
when i first saw the tracklisting for the latest release on jochem peteris label i felt uneasy dutch producer one of the greatest talents in modern electronic music and the creator of a perfect house record trespassers had commissioned me to remix no disrespect intended but while me have put out a number of decent house records and one anthem rej they are hardly of a sufficient calibre to rework or so i thought german duos first take on the track is an epic ambient affair that sees them add layer upon layer of atmospheric chords fter a while a niggling riff that sounds like a guitar insinuates itself into the arrangement followed by chiming bells and a repetitive vocal sample to describe the arrangement in these terms is to do it an injustice though as the overall sound is spellbindingly melodic and deeply seductive not much changes on the second version except that me bring the vocal sample to the fore add a gorgeous disco filter and lithe back beats to lend it some dance floor clout but the end result attains the kind of wide eyed wondrous sensuality of trespassers in other words: me 9 brophys prejudices 0
on last years limited cassette mix from plo man the artist who goes by c3deee was slotted on the mood side between a beatless track by x-102 (aka jeff mills robert hood and mike banks) and a jon hassell brian eno track whoever the artist is c3deee has been involved in every subsequent release (save for plo man) now releasing a three-tracker as xalip since the label seems to operate along a berlin / vancouver axis the closest parallel to might be slow riffs mood hut 12-inch (these credits mention all three tracks were made in vancouver) but with its tectonic rumbles and incessant screwed-down wind chimes this record sounds more luded than new age the doesnt have a beat but its the standout track its mesmeric pulse rippling hiss and distant bass churn exerting their own gravitational pull the flipside carries on as before no beat in sight but after three tracks like this theres nothing to give this ambience more of a charge or a change in texture with more distorted bells and lo-fi tones wavering like a mirage on the horizon it neither comes closer nor comes into focus
since the settlement of vancouver has been one of the most unfamiliar and inaccessible corners of the city originally inhabited by first nations peoples it became home to a small community of settlers who built an airport and a boeing factory that made warplanes for the royal air force the expansion of the airport throughout the 20th century destroyed about half of the islands community and a good portion of its untouched natural beauty leaving behind an industrial wasteland and a tangle of natural reserves is the latest in scott morgans series of records chronicling different parts of vancouver following sketches from new brighton strathcona variations and first narrows but more than any of those releases captures the loss and contradictions of its namesake morgan treats his subject with a mixture of reverence and wonder as he employs guitar piano voice and other sounds each new addition feels natural like an addition to the stillness rather than a pebble in the pond on k female vocal tones are just another color in the palette carefully painting a picture of creeping unease named for the famous sewer pipe that stretches for miles into the sea morgan uses bright chime sounds to contrast its aqueous flows packs tension conflict and resolution into its eight and a half minutes flitting through drone and techno before closing with a passage of stark piano just as morgans use of instrumentation is uncannily subtle so is his work with percussion which emerges again in the dub-techno pulse of lull and the disarmingly direct a standout on the lp with grand pianos and widescreen melodies is triumphant but naggingly sad straightforward but also immensely complex that sense of emotional ambiguity has always been at the heart of morgans work but on its reinforced with stirring songwriting there are so many layers especially once you start to pick apart the times and places hes referencing the nautical pull of and lull the deflated lilt of written about the warplane factory but you dont need to come from vancouver or do any research to understand s imposing powerful appeal: music this haunting is more universal than local
footprintz member north steps out for his first full solo release with on the result is a more lavish version of the canadian duos laidback synth pop the eps crowning achievement is a collaboration with that goes overdrive into cellphone-waving territory napologetically capitalizing on the most mawkish impulses of their respective obsessions with melancholy practically hits you over the head with how regal its trying to be careful ivory tinkling and gently sighing vocals add to the loved-up mood lucky for them it works its hard to imagine a more evocative way to end a dj set or a more rousing way to begin one the remaining five tracks tend to feel more like sketches albeit detailed ones a brash sense of luxury where everything is sick with oversaturated colour the best is the -lite with its plaintive vocal refrain hits harder breeding blog house with italo plays with some workaday squelch and is the kind of louche pop youd expect from footprintz but without the vocals none of these tracks the brief and unremarkable included match up to the majesty of but they make up a solid ep with one hell of a cherry on top
singapore doesnt have the sort of afterhours cache europe does but promoter sees no reason why this should be the case: organizing late night invite only events where guests like kink and surgeon often go unannounced until kickoff has started to build a reputation beyond the southeast asian metropolis it calls home their new label arm should certainly help smartly pairs an established producer with a relatively unknown local named but while the formers name might prompt you to grab the record off the shelf the latters tracks might be what gets it out of the shop in your hands s contributions are in no way a weak link: torontos stuart li is as solid as ever on and two characteristically epic and subtly aggressive burners li isnt at his most distinctive here dolly and nonplus nailed down his choicest material over the last year or so but hes certainly taken the labels long past midnight origins to heart delivering cuts equally ravey and pitch black s b sides are a bit less adventurous but their directness draws you in straightforwardly percussive with just a squiggle of piano melody recalls bsu in his early days with its heavy synth top end stops just short of overdoing it at points but seems to know just the right moment to pull back and reset the build

a collaborative remix with lv in 2010 was the last we heard from toru koda aka on label has been his main outlet outside of his native japan ten years after kodas debut on the uk label s padded chords and mellow synths feel like the return of an old friend is richer and less 8-bit-sounding than kodas previous releases but the introspective yet funky mood is the same with its half-step pulse and g-funk synth recalls classic dubstep so does the junglisist bustle and off-beat accent of a key energising track but is no exercise in nostalgia tracks are fast and playful in a way that most macho dubstep isnt kodas arrangements and cohesive sounds provide freshness to a style that might seem like a throwback in s four tracks are built to last but they can feel understated and too subtle in a climate of swagger playfulness can tip over into cuteness and introspection can turn into melancholy res nothing on you could call a banger but its complexity is worth savoring
combines the production talents of panda one and the vocals of funnily enough jack splash rashida the outfits dj was in trickys band until about a year ago and backs up the album with all the afro shaking hip hop funk laden blues and roots beats lyrically jack splash takes a very similar vocal approach to andr 3000 (outkast) but with variable degrees in tune and tone making for another unique release never the less a welcome addition to melt in the funk pot titles like got2get2gether4luv and underwaterloveboogie obviously have a huge cheese factor fun as it is the pots filled to the brim with not so subtle influences george clintons parliament outkast and early shades of prince appreciate thumps in with a fat charged up beat on the bass end with jack splash on the high end of his range wanting you just to appree ciate plugging up the gaps is the twang of some funk fuelled guitar riffs horn curls paving way for some tamborine accompaniment receiving a lot of radio airplay almost as much as appreciate when she smiles she lights the sky is a soft ballad with well executed beats backed by vocals of ba ba baba a wonderfully ambient tune its subtle hand claps and muted guitar slide in to emphasise the layed back feel dropping in a girl or oh yeah with every break jack adds his own style to the cd however similar to andr 3000 he still manages to bust out some funk fuelled tunes to get your ass wriggling busting out the booty movers the girl said give it to me fires out a screamer with feisty organ stabs wa wa guitar kit fills and turns andr whoops i meant jack splash soars up the higher end of the scale doing his thing accompanied by the real gritty funk with no intention of taking anything away from new album its similarities and influences are undeniable it still remains fresh with its intent of feel good tunes and an optimistic approach to shaking your thang all tracks are made with the sole intention of making you get up and then get back down 01 jack s back 02 appreciate 03 underwaterloveboogie (deep blue) 04 when she smiles she lights the sky 05 we can get high 06 bottle of hope (save the world) 07 why d u call me (3am) 08 real folks 09 got2get2gether4luv 10 two beautiful souls in a crazy world 11 beautiful babies 12 stardancer 13 the girl said give it to me 14 luv 4 the world (why they gotta hate ) 15 precious heart 16 table 4 2 17 if i wuz ur man 18 i know those eyes 19 new day
listening to is like falling down the rabbit hole you never know where youll end up over five studio albums and one live recording with the britten sinfonia the eight-piece troupe from norway have pushed traditional and improvised jazz concepts into various unpredictable configurations with elements of breaks drum bass techno and idm all included the electronic flourishes made them a standout live ensemble but you could say that they were at their best as a clearcut rock band on what we must their 2005 debut proggy and post-rock undertones transformed their woozy watercolour signature into something terribly catchy and even singalong at times the vocal washes amplified guitars and generally song-like structures set this one apart from the roving experimentalism that defined its predecessors and its the same guitars drums and rock sentiment that greets you on s latest offering on at first that is another what we must this certainly is not with were back to s surprise tactic only with more bolshy neon-la influence added to the mix take the lead track it starts out dreamy and loose before spooky ufo synths reset the tone a little all typical tropes then the jazz nodes creep in and suddenly like a crack of lightening electronic harshness slices through the pastel allure its jarring without being too unsettling like little electric shocks readying you for the squelchy bass breakdown that nobody saw coming this progresses into something almost daft punk-like before petering out into more native albeit electrified jaga territory then as the electronic din subsides we finish on a final tumult between elevator jazz loveliness and more of those squealing electronic lightening bolts at five tracks long is a short lp but these are all rich heavy vistas you find yourself stumbling through a sprawling mass of instrumentation on sometimes it works but for the most part it feels awkward and out of place is a delightful reprieve from the showiness thats prevalent throughout its poised and gentle and offers the most harmonious self-remixing element here: a spacey sci-fi transition that doesnt seem to fight against s natural grain as it does elsewhere tries to weave the two worlds together and does a better job than but both tracks leave you spinning theres a lot to take in here was never meant to be consistent but in opting for something clever and innovative have sacrificed what made what we must so memorable wont get stuck in your head for days but you could spend weeks unpacking it and still never quite get to the bottom of it
- is one of the most striking sequences from koyaanisqatsi a masterpiece of cinematography and soundtracking in the sequence the immense high-density housing project of the same name in st louis is shown completely deserted and extensively vandalised before being demolished with the track names this release is clearly an allegory for the project if not paying tribute directly to the film and mainstay incorporates the labels signature digital sharpness and masterfully reflects the estate itself and the films bleak prophesies of social demise to chilling effect viewed from a distance these structures are made of so many artifacts that they seem almost homogeneous but upon closer inspection the clutter with which theyre constructed is meticulously arranged with rough bit-crushed distortion and shards of high frequency crackling around one another once youre within them not analysing but simply feeling a precise glitch funk emerges corroded and dense dancehall rhythms in fall the tireless pounding of brick-on-brick in rise advancing bulldozers stuttering with broken mechanisms in alva s remodel and although ben destroys most rhythm shards of glass and the remnants of an empty two-step can still be identified through the terrible dust clouds that remain: its what burial might sound like if his mourning turned to scathing damnation

inhouse vol 2 is the second in the series of label overviews from the up and coming (deep) house label from germany s central east the compilation originally came out as a double vinyl set of exclusive tracks including efforts from label boss iel and the artful mixers of this cd version but while the vinyl was a solid compilation without a single dud track it somehow lacked a final absolute killer moment to take it over the threshold perhaps it suffered from being aimed at djs rather than something for the home listener to follow back to back in any case the final step over the edge has arrived in the form of said (berlin based norman webber and marco resmann also known himself as phage) the dynamic duo have taken all of the eight vinyl tracks and weaved them together with six of the best of s back catalogue to create a sprightly and beguilingly diverse stream of music this is indeed one of the highlights of the package: lce seem to know exactly what to pinpoint in each of the varied tracks without losing the seam that holds them together the set travels from the sensuous house of s opener (from the original vinyl) heading through micro house dub vibrations tight pinpoint specks of minimal and even the nu jazz periphery of s llow (again on the vinyl) before heading back again lce use a little patience and a strong ear for the label s deeper side to take things up and down at the right pace always playing to labels best moments and taking advantage of the mixing to give back to vol 2 what the vinyl couldn t do on its own there isn t a bad moment here and finding a key track is impossible there is also a great feeling of lightness and play that is dynamic and dare i say it genuinely entertaining as a label mix there isn t even a hint of arrogance or nepotism; always lce let the music be itself and again the distinctness of each track is a high point highly recommended if you like a little house or are searching for an introduction to a label that is and will be worth watching
joris voorns solo productions have smooth synth textures and subdued crisp rhythms that both nod to detroit and have a flair all of their own together with edwin oosterwal as voorn has taken a tougher european approach in the past tracks such as dec trec and for the people were straight-up floor-driven techno aimed at cranking up the heat in more indulgent club atmospheres yet proves to be a poke in the eye for anyone expecting more of the same yes there are little house-influenced finger clicks and a get-busy bass synth but then surprisingly enough it finds room for voorn s trademark euphoric sweeps although this time they re used very sparingly instead of developed throughout the track in his customary epic fashion in effect it s a snippet of voorn in his solo style with the subtlety of the sweeps teasing the listener as the rest of the track pulses along insistently cliche is more of an overview of whats been happening clubwise in the last couple of years everyone s mother is having a stab at minimal and joris and edwin follow suit without quite getting in bed with the mob completely the distinctive swells give it an original touch and there s a half bleep/half beat sound that ll remind you who you are listening to oth sides are dependable club fare but neither is as strong or complete as dec trec that said if the rig is big enough you could quite easily lose the plot dancing to these cuts
superpitchers eagerly awaited new speicher enzian follows in the trancey footsteps of oxias domino (and indeed of patrick chadronnets eve by day from which domino was shamelessly pilfered) yet it doesnt deliver half the satisfaction - instead only mustering an air of expectation a typically terse pitcher-esque bassline promises greatness twisting into acid squelches as round percussion skips left to right emaciated claps arriving on the four menacing pads and strings fly the microgoth flag thickened up by reverb and relentless hats but its all to little purpose enzian is a frustrating cut: tension is everywhere but the early promise remains unfulfilled one to play before a straight-to-the-point killer jorg burger resurrects his stardiver moniker for borderline a trawl through familiar modernist traits ive always admired burgers instantly identifiable stamp and while there is enough of his sound to enjoy here the track is hardly mindblowing eighties casio percussion enters limply and were stuck with a tinny snare for the duration of this lope through formulaic warmth and bounce nothing staggering the superpitchers the winner here but that too needs a shot of adrenaline
a well known producer from sheffield in his twentys has continued a run of releases to shake up your thoughts on the direction of popular music today collaborating with well known pop artists such as the suga babes kelis liberty x (no relation) richard takes a leftfield approach to reworking pop tracks and eighties classics alike richards remix of tlcs hit no scrubs (bootleg) that he released himself under the name girls on top had record label virgin signing him up rather than sending the lawyers round for blood pushing things forward in a perilous direction of warped eighties tracks richard manages to get away with releasing a motley collection of songs on the back to mine series other artist releases on the series include dave seaman danny tenaglia groove armada faithless everything but the girl orbital new order the orb underworld tricky audio bullys just to name a few independent dance label dmc has had a raging success with these releases but richards mix from his personal collection is more of a mash up of different tunes taking an obscure turn off the beaten path with some well known names appearing on the cd it appears that the more out there tracks from some artists have made it on to the tracklisting like goldfrapps black cherry and kelis young fresh n new if your into an alternative from your everyday tunes or are looking for something else to keep you exploring what else is out there dont get to ready for a ground breaking cd that takes you into another world of electro pop eighties kick back songs instead i think youll be asking yourself how some of these songs were released let alone made it on to this compilation on the other hand if you want a cd that brings back memories of living through the eighties and miss the sound that has come to be all so popular at the moment this cd would fit into the collection of records that you can find for a dollar in your local op-shop not totally writing off richards taste in music for he has released some quirky tracks worth their recognition but this one sounds like a mix tape found in the back of your car dating back to 1985 tracklisting 01 i monster who is she 02 john carpenter assault on precinct 13 03 goldfrapp black cherry 04 jona lewie youll always find me in the kitchen at parties 05 kelis young fresh n new 06 nivea run away (i wanna be with you) 07 heaven 17 let me go 08 animotion obsession 09 s y d featuring nancy fortune discomanic 10 legowelt vs orgue electronique haunted arp 11 pete shelley homosapien (dub) 12 mum dad dawn rider 13 denton and cook tomorrows world theme from the bbc tv series 14 trans x living on video 15 fpu ocean drive (tigas white linen vox) 16 the silures 21 ghosts
has become synonymous with consistently quality bass music over the past three years with each release pushing the boundaries of dubstep while retaining plenty of dance floor functionality the same applies to the debut release on the label for who up until now has been content with displaying his djing skills alongside his partner-in-crime ilal at their ruk parties and on their supplementary radio show the pair were way ahead of the curve when it came to bringing together house dubstep and uk garage all under one roof and its this hybridization that informs both of the tracks on this 12-inch lovers of more orthodox house music will be drawn to the four-to-the-floor kick of -side lue which was one of the highlights of peverelists r podcast from earlier this year clocking in at 124 pm its by far the slowest track that the label has issued to date although the influence of uk funky is more than apparent in its syrupy looped vocal and punchy snare triplets while many of these hybrids are going the way of aggressive fidgety bass licks and noisy breakdowns a la the night slugs camp s take on the sound is much more refined relying on subtle rhythmic inflections and a killer groove the hard hitting synthesized string blasts of recall the grimier end of early uk funky but again manages to create a joyously hypnotic cut syncopated 808 bass samples mesh with the trebly ping pong percussion and looped dance with me command to create a deep yet propulsive roller while the second half of the track sees the pads drop out to make way for a layer of delayed 808 cowbells before finishing with two minutes of drifting beatless synth work ll in all its a staggeringly accomplished debut release
n unflinching proponent of uk funky and bassline champion appears to be an odd four tet collaborator on paper weve seen him do fine things with peers like mel flava d and terror danjah though his 2013 remix of four tets kool fm while excellent seemed more about keeping with beautiful rewind s london-centric pirate radio ethos its taken kieran hebden two years to further their allegiance doing so with a two-tracker from the pair for his text label most will be drawn to because of hebden but the impact of champions presence cant be overstated trainspotters should recognize these two from recent mixes namely four tets dekmantel podcast and essential mix with jamie xx both tracks are firmly rooted in uk club traditions and to their benefit treat that space like a jungle gym rather than a temple is essentially a reimagining of delacys hideaway a 1995 club hit produced by new jersey house duo blaze the spirited empowering vocal is retrofitted with a ukg shimmy and one of champions compressed-air basslines a gassy and infectious thing thatll surely incite roars if given a rewind uses samples more abstractly turning clips from debelah morgans i love you into angelic wisps they give the track a lovely melodic hook and complement the atmospheric birdsong and sparse synth flourishes nd champions influence sharp jabs of percussion resonant bass weight and a nimble rhythmic sense gives the delicate touches some necessary bite thats what you might call a perfect match
are the first signing to jacques greenes vase label that isnt jacques greene you can immediately understand why while their music owes a lot more to sun-soaked indie rock and shoegaze than the buoyant house their label boss deals in it shares in the same giddy love of melody the three tracks on run together like a short suite and is the cinematic intro easing listeners in with saccharine vocals and coursing spurts of synth that emulsify into overwhelming sheets of sound the vocals have a rian wilson-esque sheen that complements the filmy synths and they become most prominent on the eps title track which rattles and shakes around an arpeggio as if had wondered into some rainfeeder-esque recording session think a jacques greene track left out to bake in the sun colours running and drums caught in the muck the closer wipes away some of the red and orange dye for a disjointed lopsided funk number vocals still cooing softly in the background despite the jagged beat and resonant synths have a pointedly pretty sound that doesnt lack any power and this ep is a tantalizing taste of their potential
secret weapons are a tough one in the digital age with everybody eager to repress (legally and illegally) lost classics and videos popping up of dj sets on youtube asking (and receiving) track ids theres almost no such thing as a secret weapon anymore for record collectors who undoubtedly love the chase like dixon and me then it must be doubly hard: once things get out into the world in any capacity its immediately too overexposed lucky for the rest of us then that they do make the effort eh you can be pretty secure in the knowledge that the tunes released under this series name are both the business and ultra rare to boot and while i cant speak to the latter here the former is undoubtedly true kalabreses remix of s is a stunning deep house tune with all of the right african vibes something you can hear slotting neatly into one of dixons sets while dj regorys reminds of that early kitsune single he put out in its perfect balance between earthy keys and effortless broken beat momentum dutch duo are resuscitated on the b side with a banging tool that stabs and stabs while building a marvelous house track while s lives up to its title with a fat kick and congas puttering away beneath some eastern tinged synths
more than eight million people live in new york and most of them spend some part of their day going somewhere is one of them in densely populated places transportation is sometimes taken for granted but drafts a love letter to it on he reimagines new yorks crisscrossing map as a series of smooth flowing lines moving unhurried and hassle-free through them s giddy percussive melody is tempered by a sophisticated sway while sinks commuter chatter beneath vocal fx and sunny pads with the staccato bounce of in their headphones pedestrians might clop down the sidewalk even faster on tracks like and the music is a shade brighter the tape-worn music on absorbs some modish sounds including vancouver house and vaporwave but s loosely sketched themes are enough to keep your gaze on the scenery most of the tracks move at a leisurely pace including a windswept closing track with chest-swelling strings and a soft doleful synth melody as the air whips and the music soars invites you to perch on its summit this trip is fun but the last stop is s highlight
following the release of their self-titled lp earlier this year (and a pre-lp remixes record with roly porter vatican shadow and kangding ray) offer another trio of reworks that head out on tangents from the duos own droning industrialized style keith justin broadrick as jk and grischa have been invited to the lair this time its a record thats similar in approach to part 1 a side-long soundscape backed by two rhythmic pieces is up first with a rework of the gasping nesthesia its a nearly 14 minute-long immersion in bubbling sputtering noise like a vat overflowing with unstable chemical agents some listeners will want to jump right in but for me it sticks around for too long id rather go with porters beatless remix on part 1 which makes an equally enthralling ruckus with six minutes to spare broadricks jk reshape of on the flip though might be the finest thing yet from the label its soaring minor-key synths distorted growls and brutish jungle-inflected drums summon a wonderfully noir-ish vibe rounding out this pack like the previous one is a raster-noton affiliate his 0113_31_vsh_rmx_b of is a glitchy somewhat clinical affair (as you might expect) with space for what sounds like shards of processed violin carved out between stepping percussion its a solidly off-kilter contribution that holds the most dj potential but overall its broadricks tough yet evocative effort that should prove hardest to resist and crucially the hardest to forget
its definitely been written before but the most important thing to keep in mind when approaching dave huismanss material as is its unpredictable nature his releases usually end up dipping into several genres within the span of a few tracks and is no different; its three tracks are among his most outr shortcuts the two entirely new tracks and are melodically sparse: the former employs some subtle synth tones throughout with an acid line developing about halfway through while the latter is drenched in ominous drones without huismanss exceptional beat-programming prowess this kind of minimalism could be a problem but hes proven himself to be a master at making the most broken structures compelling the punchy off-kilter sensibility that marks both and is a different beast entirely from the current vogue of vaguely tropical funky-not-funky dubstep-not-dubstep; well-swung yes but also serendipitous the sound of capitalizing on accidents sometimes i think about recording my radiator when it makes this funky clicking noise (which is also responsible for bothering anyone who sleeps in my living room) and i wonder if huismans is inspired by naturally-occurring mechanical rhythms like it; bizarre and even grating at first but eventually loose and hypnotic the ep closes with an early take of love in outer space one of the highlights from last years unbalance album under the 2562 moniker shorter rougher and wobblier its an interesting sketch to compare with its spacious refined descendent
2010s into great wide yonder was so grand and cinematic you might have thought anders trentem ller had moved from copenhagen to hollywood hes gone in the opposite direction while some music sounds like it belongs in a paul thomas anderson film or an explosive episode breaking bad this is mostly a song-based album with guest vocalists ( the the raveonettes) at the fore with their help trentem ller explores the influences he collected on harbour boat trips gothic americana mordant indie-rock primitive electro but shoots them through with the rippling electronica you expect from the man who made that techno masterpiece last resort its a wild theatrical and at times bloated ride in 12 tracks that run to well over an hour trentem ller veers from alt country ( ) through propulsive electro-rock ( ) and on into several krautrock odysseys starts out as a glam rock stomp and eventually peaks in a delirious rush welding the glossy trance gui boratto to the rhythmic complexity james holden it exemplifies trentem llers tendency to cram in a million ideas where three would do is so big and so clever that its easy to be taken by it at least initially re is a dazzling technical brilliance to (think: doors ray manzarek joining neu to interpret a hindu raga) or which recasts mercury revs bittersweet psychedelia in an electronic context but despite all the imagination at play the more you listen to it the more there seems to be something hollow in such showmanship is an intelligent record but it lacks the cohesive focus and emotional resonance a great one it is at its most effective and affecting when trentem ller reins himself in and keeps it simple kittin-ish electro s track and johnny s perfectly-tuned pop song are the best things here but would trentem ller ever produce a whole album that direct and purposeful dont hold your breath
one reason i liked s la la la so much is that their long drawn-out take-you-on-a-ride tracks seemed to zip by thats mostly because they were good at grabbing and holding and the same thing applies in a different way to this new release is one of those tracks where when it starts you gird yourself for nine minutes worth only to look up what seems like no time later and see that its nearly finished the track is mostly made up of overlapping rubbery keyboards playing the same or similar lines throughout federico marton and marco donato keep varying the arrangement so it stays fresh the unyielding thump beneath provides as much footing as you could want; its like strolling through a cave is a pure percussion exercise cutting up a military-style drum corps and eventually folding in industrial scrape bouncing machine kicks and clattering snare rolls and occasional looming bass notes its a tool-plus built for the floor but remaining listenable finally lind give a dank dubstep spin thats heavy on robotic clang and light on actual suspense
the ep which launches rabits label comes from south west londoner the producer has approached grime from all sorts of angles in his young career (he briefly offered an 83-track download when this ep was announced) and the results have generally been striking but scrappy s debut proper tidies up the edges of his sound focusing on his talent for melancholic tunes rendered in cool synth tones paired with a rhythmic approach that distills uk dance patterns into toy-like loops the results sound uncannily like zomby circa natalias song drills deep into this sound releasing a seven-track study with plenty of compelling moments the eps crisp side-sticks finger clicks and shakers never lose their composure hints of aggression like the snare drills in are softened with a cathedrals worth of reverb only on do things get a little maudlin and by the eps latter half has hit a comfortable stride the bongo-led and whose oval synths skip gently across the beat are both excellent as with zomby at his best these are simple compact tracks with just the right amount of romance in their dna
it can be everyday sounds or tiny bits from a track or from a movie says of her sampling inspiration can come from any kind of source lewiss music often reminds me of another champion of the everyday helm both producers find an aesthetic charge in the mundane: the hum of a fridge distant laughter both have developed a dreamlike sound that ought to be comforting to listen to but is often distressing though its hard to say exactly why in an experimental scene that increasingly draws on standardised forms and boilerplate emotions their determination to skirt the edge of the familiar is refreshing lewiss latest album nails the ambiguity better than 2014s ett the tracks are less dependent on repeating loops instead following fluid unexpected paths the textural weave is denser and the emotions it expresses harder to pin down s closest relative is neo-classical ambient swooning string-like chords watery climaxes but lewis keeps us from getting too comfortable on liquid chords lap against and are ultimately drowned out by a muffled drone as if were trying to listen over the grumble of an air conditioner similar sounds sluice around uncertainly on while percussion taps ominously down below like the impatient drumming of the devils fingers the rest of the album is similar plenty of lewiss processed samples are attractive but she smears and darkens them until theyre just vague shapes in the distance percussion when it appears is a vague funereal thud and voices are unintelligible a track like a cloud of sound that takes five minutes to emerge out of silence seems calculated to express no clear emotion at all depending on your mood it could be blissful or unsettling or more likely some awkward combination of the two all of this restraint starts to drag after a while and a few more dramatic moments help push things along the glittering drones in opener are gorgeous and the weird tortured squeal that pops up halfway through is bizarre closer starts with a few seconds of jubilant applause as if congratulating us for making it through the worlds most surreal marathon from there it launches into what sounds like a punchdrunk cocteau twins instrumental its almost pop but off-key samples snake across its surface like tendrils of fog making everything less clear
above all the music of knowles is about refinement his field deep house may be densely populated but knowles talent lies in drilling deep into its conventions to excavate objects of unusual beauty in this regard he seems only to be improving at least if nour and light is anything to go by central to its appeal is which opens draped in sheets of static before over eight minutes slowly gaining clarity and pace by the end were on firmer house ground some gloopy synth stabs here a melt-in-the-mouth chord there in another producers hands the cleverness of this progression would be foregrounded but here knowles makes it seem as simple and natural as breathing each track has its own subtle but effective drama takes its title from the featured field recording of a street evangelist struggling to be heard against a bustling background knowles who named his debut lp after a hill near his rural welsh hometown has always kept the urban at arms-length; here its bedded deep beneath sizzling hi-hats and rich windswept chords meanwhile centres on the sort of twinkly two-chord piano loop that pleasantly says very little its all in the framing: the pads like rich trails of butter across a warm frying pan; the bassline enormous and muslin-soft; the surprisingly tight flex between kick drum and hi-hat only the darker with its meandering steelpan bassline is less than a direct hit

wasnt planning to release any remixes of tracks from his debut lp 13 apparently though tale and jens-uwe got hold of the stems for the lengthy mid-album oddity retouched its shifting cascade of drums and synths for use in their own dj sets they sent copies to and well here we are the tale and version does just what youd expect it to sanding down the originals edges ladling on the warm textures and gradually building tension into the newly streamlined mix the bass pads key squalls and tottering hats that begin jens-uwe s remix suggest a more abstract rework eventually though a similarly linear groove emerges that should be as useful to djs as the a-side 13 for all its charms occasionally lost focus so its refreshing to hear such direct refits of one of its oddest tracks
its been quite a recent run for gunnar wendel aka releasing tracks on house staple labels such as laid mikrodisko spectral sound and kinda soul but also venturing further afield into more unexpected territories with efforts on meatlheadz and nonplus+ podcasts aplenty touring and a huge remix from omar-s have seen his popularity rise significantly over the past 12 months listening to this release for will bankheads trilogy tapes label its easy to see why recorded live from his appearance at the label night held earlier this year the mix is 45 minutes (due to the restrictions of the cassette format) of raw house and techno with no tracklist provided its a blind journey through analogue drums weird melodies and wtf moments and according to fact magazine side b is the same as side a except in reverse either way mosses transitions from driving detroit beats to blissful synths are mesmerising from the dark and moody start the mix progresses through several emotions ending on higher tempo club material only to drop back down into oddball territory; vocal samples of a man playing on an old game console while toms and snares fall all around him strange enough to be interesting but still able to keep you dancing all night its what has made mosse an important name for house and techno heads over the past few years look for that to continue into 2011
for fans of tough retroactive techno 2009 was an excellent if not altoge r paradigm shifting year with a seemingly constant stream of above average 12 inches and eps flying in from all quarters (well mostly erlin but a fair few o r spots too) judging by this offering which sees three of scenes most esteemed operatives laying down goods for elgian tastemakers curle lets set to be a case of (much) more of same side is a little less moody than youd expect from a / collab first in what one hopes will be a long standing partnership and delves a good deal fur r into free flowing dub techno territory than ei r mans solo output has done thus far it works a treat hitting a smart balance between aes tic artifice a skillfully modulated vocal forms its central motif underpinned by taut kicks and slinky claps and body rocking dance floor swing side on o r had goes straight for gullet wrapping bombastic shard like splices of melody around flatulent bass and a shuffling stop start 4/4 stomp its quite tonic to what unsurprisingly is a painfully classy side and played at appropriate moment (around 4 m on a sunday morning) will be sure to have ravers in a perfect state of delirium

you could describe s debut for the new label run by robert-johnsons oliver hafenbauer as quirky its most conventional moment is a crunching piece of dark house built on rattling rimshots and suppressed claps ut sandwiched either side are two very different beasts constructs a paranoid endless breakbeat out of what sounds like a bunch of household appliances a churning washing machine rhythm spins hypnotically accompanied by a hoover-like suck-and-blow and a metallic thwack providing its rhythm eats are dispensed with entirely on alea an acoustic guitar loop sprawls across 13 minutes dragging you into a battering vortex of sci-fi blips and bloops underscored by whats probably the gentle lapping of waves on shingle although given the individuality on show here it might just as easily be the sound of a slowed-down soviet army goosestep its an oddly appealing piece of ghostly alearic
youll rarely see a more joyful refutation of the anxiety of influence than this rdjcs5 refers to a yamaha cs5 formerly owned by richard d james aka aphex twin purchased at auction by a buyer who loaned the instrument to his friend s jason amm every sound on this ep comes from that instrument itd be gimmicky if the music werent so full and so confident; theres no evident struggle in having bent the thing to make kicks and hi-hats along with every other squelch ping and plaintive warble and it helps that amm is clearly engaging with james legacy at the level of form not just property: all four tracks combine the na ve melodies of classic rephlex with terse detroit-via-d sseldorf electro grooves the sounds meanwhile are so rich so present theyre almost tactile; you dont have to be an analog purist to think so oh and did i mention that the cs5 is monophonic in an age of vsts and nearly unlimited processing power theres something quaint about choosing to work with such limited parameters; theres also something almost heroic about pulling it off as effortlessly as this
at a time when aphex twin has an active soundcloud account just about anything seems possible so goes the return of global the pioneering ambient techno duo of mark pritchard and tom middleton who made some of the most important electronic music of the 90s they havent arrived totally out of the blue though the pair issued a couple of mix cds in the 2000s and have been performing together more recently though this remix package holds the first global productions since 1997 (although its only middleton behind these tracks) s big-room house might seem like an odd catalyst for the projects return and yet that musics proggy roots not to mention its sense of melody and melodrama does align itself with global s more floor-oriented moments the main remix of sounds like a vintage global track made with modern production values or at least post-2000 production values (theres a hint of sasha in the flowy featherweight synth melodies and its generally high-gloss coat ) the eight-minute remix takes its time building whats essentially a five-minute intro for some unexpected drum breaks that crash through the back half in glorious slow motion a mix takes out s vocal sample and replaces the 4/4 pulse with a looser dub techno rhythm casting those contoured synth sounds in a light that that feels more like the global we know silky and seductive these remixes are a welcome surprise if not substantial enough to hold up the weight of a big comeback

t was a handful fearsomely groovy dubstep-techno hybrids released between 2007 and 2009 which first brought nstam renown lars st we went on to produce two albums for modeselektors 50 weapons that expanded and refashioned his ideas into an eccentric sprawl equal parts berlin techno 90s dm and synth-prog grandiosity you couldnt criticise ambition but you could criticise results: flashes brilliance were too ten obscured by bloated structures and jarring shifts in tone ts gratifying n to see st we return to dance floor 12-inch with the released on dublins it comes under new alias the prevailing mood is dark and muck-caked though bright daubs colour that st we tends to favour are never far away the is cavernous but stumbling with great slabs distorted bass constantly nudging beat so far so charcoal industrial techno but chords that appear in breakdown are verging on hands-in- -air material of works within a similar template but its whipcrack snares and claps are even more satisfying pairs signature nstam breakbeats with spiralling melodies in vein mber -era utechre the stylistic co-ordinates this release will be familiar to nstam fans but execution is more distilled and controlled than st we has attempted in some time
simon green k seems like an obvious choice for his music is often stuck in that space between waking and sleeping while latenightales which has released mixes from the likes of lindstr m ir and nightmares on wax is famous for its woozy early hours aesthetic this in mind its no surprise s contribution to the series is a success much of the music here has its roots in folk ohallorans which opens the set is a delicate miniature full of deep strings and close mic piano pedals which soon gives way to the oddly east sian sounding alt country of houstons bin incense vibe is rounded off by s of s a version that manages to remove almost all of the originals listless hippiness instead approaching it in a way that calls to mind recent 4hero of the mixs key qualities is the open mindedness with which green approaches his selections blog folk artist seems just as comfortable here as often forgotten soul singer darondo the pair sharing that bittersweet delivery that sits somewhere between deep depression and pure wonder at life just as important is greens unassuming mixing style which typically involves little more than a slow crossfade ts precisely the sort of unembellished performance the material calls for set stumbles though when its at its most raucous for instance when irheads phenomenally uninteresting follows (and completely undermines) s quietly lilting te this is doubly frustrating because green is perfectly capable of neatly slotting in more effusive records as he does with s down ( t takes number) when green trusts his own downbeat instincts though feels comforting in a way few mixes do t reinforces greens credentials as a dj and perfectly encapsulates the too late to go to bed too early for coffee state of mind for which the series is made
s is the latest reissue from s timeless 90s catalogue the icelandic label which first operated between 1995 and 2002 put out some of the best dub techno of all time during its initial run only to return in 2013 due to renewed interest in its early releases was a little-used alias of a alsteinn gu mundsson the artist best known as yagya tougher than the atmospheric productions he would later make his name on presents four dub techno bombs featuring the sense of adventure dub techno mostly left behind in the 90s the dreamy is around 136 bpm and features a twinkling melody and tape hiss floating over a pumping kick an open hi-hat comes and goes until a clap boosts the energy halfway in a mangled technoid breakdown similar to those found in anthony shake shakirs plugged in drags you underwater before bringing you back to up with a series of bubbling aphex twin-style bleeps is the eps most conventional track with a jazzy bassline and a linear progression is meaner and similarly driving while ity and are scrambled with mind-bending panning and filtered chords is this dub techno or an acid trip
arrives nearly two years after the first ep for 301c symphony and just over a year since his last record the greane / gigha 12-inch on phonica the once-prolific 40-something scottish producer named neil mcdonald may have abruptly halted his release schedule but that doesnt seem to have stopped the music from flowing (it has after all always been a hobby ) he recently told the ransom note that in addition to releasing and a couple one-off tracks hes about to wrap up an album and has two other eps in the works f the lush astral funky house of these four productions is an indication of whats to come mcdonald will pick up right where his streak left off what first hits you about and what will stay with you after its finished is the sheer amount of melody packed into it the whole thing brims with harmony and layered passages of keys pads bass and gummy 303 sequences mcdonalds longstanding love affair with acid certainly plays a role here but its all backlit with a halo of light at the edges even when begins with a slippery squelch its soon enough softened by the glow of tender chords and the mantric sample dont you forget me and operate on a shared wavelength tying together spacey delay concise drum patterns thick low-end and innumerable synth patches into a sound that straddles early house and dm though not a dance floor go-to stands out for its massive bass notes and effective and somehow not cheesey use of pan flutes in an understated 110 bpm framework ts a dreamy and fitting end for
a catchy beat attacks with a vocal beginning the ride on written in verse chorus verse the tight kick drum long low end bass itchy woodblock and bell drops lead to a bouncy guitar riff the chorus jumps in leading to a second verse/chorus song structure before a longer second breakdown gives rise to a female vocal telling her inviting story a loosely played rock-esque guitar takes over with a reverb effect - imagine jimmy hendrix using maaddddd reverb with the beat lowly riding underneath this surfaces out to piano notes crashing in very un-timed fashion: so un-timed it should cause the dance floor to go bonkers more spacey hits chime in on a crazy pattern matching the piano chords the i was walking in my kitchen spiel grabs you right away as a seductive jamaican sounding male begins conversing with the dance floor disgusting track (9/10) blippy pokes crunchy wood and dry air noises make room for a squawky bass while a similar sounding punk meets carribean vocal runs around shouting tulip schnaps on the b-side a chorus comes in breaking into its own melody of vocal bum badda boom rhythm la la las are laced in to add a sweetness cueing the original beat and chorus line while the ruff squawky bass rides out with a tuff 4/4 mix the beat rides out quick on this one so make sure you have your next bomb already cued up great new ideas and sounds (8 5/10)
like many artists s take on dance music is filled with outside influences you can hear it in his dj mixes which span bizarre and rich selections while his productions teem with bright musicality owed to disco house and funk its been three years since the berlin/leipzig artist last put out a record but in that time it seems his crate of eclectic influences has soaked in matallas second 12-inch for is a beautiful swarm of sounds that moves beyond glossy disco-house to freely experiment with form the ep has a feel of the rural outdoors from both its warm isolation and an array of textures that includes insectoid noisemakers and faintly barking dogs everything else the softly rotating rhythms the elated melodies clunk with the tangibility of woodblocks and sheet metal taking up the full a-side is a stirring house track with an ethereal motion becoming brighter and more glistening as it billows upwards at nine minutes and with an elegantly intensifying groove its the records most danceable track and also its most absorbing the b-side holds three shorter cuts that are more unconventional has a sparse atmosphere built from keys and rickety barely there percussion begins as a kind of neo-funk instrumental and then split by an unexpected gong strike reshapes into an abstract stretch of bells and bass guitar in groove and energy is most like matallas earlier house but with a curious new sense of construction

this collaborative ep is billed as being part of an effort to build a musical bridge between french producers siler s and chez s balance imprint to that end a separate remix ep is slated to come out on balance but for now this popcorn release features four versions of a track called two by siler and and two by the jazzy original has a supremely louche feel with a sample of a herbie hancock interview dominating as hazy notes from a rhodes waft unhurriedly in the background siler s club mix makes major but fairly basic changes with the vocal removed and the bass and hats given heavier prominence s versions are called the mix and the mix and both are more club-orientated than the first two cuts the former overlays the interview sample with thudding percussion and skittering keys while the latter dollops layers of atmosphere and some diva vocals into the mix lending the package a nice balance of home-listening and dj-friendliness
sometimes the stars align for a label in 2007 everything seemed to come together for dial in there are inklings of something like that happening for smallville the debut of label owners steinhoff and hammouda draws the listener into a field of similarities with pigon s wonderful promises ep from last year in fact (and i mean this as a compliment) this could almost be a lost pigon ep and certainly wouldn t be out of place in the dial catalogue like more recent dial output ( 05 onwards) it s all about the focus on the intricacies of lean interlocking melodic elements and sound planes and long tracks comprised of several movements working together to form a complex composition full of large spaces and carefully built moments the -side (which plays at fully fat rich 45rpm on the vinyl version) begins with soft vibes bounced through some short delay interspersed with light stabs that slowly mesh into a building groove driven by dry clicking percussion fter pausing for breath with a fall-away the drums build again this time joined by a sombre synth wash both tracks on the flip follow in similar form re with a slightly more old school drum sound and the title track with a gloomy and prototypically detroit-y melody perfect for those steel-skied afternoons overall this ep sits very comfortably in the dial mould and should satisfy anyone interested in hearing an emerging direction based in this sound for a debut ep the quality of the compositions here is really exceptional expect big things from this duo (and their label) as they continue to develop their own unique voice
for the uninitiated is essentially ground zero for grime the first 8-bar uk garage instrumental released back in 2002 would come to define one of londons most aggressive dance music genres today it still sounds raw and ready if not a little worse for wear new label has chosen the unusual task of updating it for on their first release and they enlist some of uk bass musics best newcomers to tackle the unenviable task first up is keysounds visionist who carefully pins canned string stabs and clipped vocal snippets to the track the same kind that would come to define the genres mid-00s heyday its a barreling update that sacrifices only a little of the originals raw power on the flipside scottish duo lackwax inject breaks into the mix taking back in time and retrofitting it with jungle attributes if you buy the digital you get a few extras including a slovenly low-end boost from pedro 123 and clumsy overdubs from elsewhere more crucially theres a turn from noted grime fan slackk his lengthy remix turns into a raucous roller of hand-percussion and bass that spills over giddily it feels the truest to the originals spirit ut as good (and as fun) as most of these remixes are they all still pale in comparison to the originals sociopathic blank stare
a commendably low-key producer whos spent the last two years willfully avoiding bandwagons steve schieberl aka lets go outside is its fair to say something of a techno outsider and responsible for some of soma records most promiscuous offerings to date this release the first from his new label slant proves no exception doggedly refusing to fit into any obvious templates title track is a rousing piece of warped mid-tempo motor techno simultaneously anthemic and unsettling metallic sheets of bass spanking claps and bright electrified shards of melody collide joyously but precariously periodically flirting with structural collapse but kept ruthlessly in order by a pummeling 4/4 kick dropped at the right time itll send people nutty takes things deep into the rave zone a racing heads-down exercise in pitch-black dancefloor functionality all paddling kicks and thick spangled chords which nevertheless contains moments of striking musical intensity faceless but dramatic its the sort of track that punctuates a night without ever really lodging in ones memory lone -side for (cue farcical mental images) completes the bill a squelchy acid workout littered with what sounds like the unwanted debris from a host of previous studio sessions its by far the creepiest cut on show and epitomizes the gutsy approach schieberl has adopted with this record
rotterdams stranger kicked the door in on with a no-holds-barred opening set for new years day at awakenings in amsterdam much like the podcasts that have emerged since his aim is to bring together the new and old in a distinctly forthright and warehouse-y manner youll just as likely hear gritty hardcore and dirty acid beats slammed in amongst the sleekest of modern-day weaponry his slalom into the camp then couldnt be more fitting with landing after dax js own jungle-techno-hardcore-melding album shades of black so far stranger releases including his paling trax contribution have rarely strayed outside of a 90s comfort zone its been fun waxing nostalgic but im ready to hear something more risqu is a step in that direction with the likes of flaunting more of a hybrid sound than a straight-up retro one despite obvious allusions in the title this ones rave has been turned into tougher stonier techno that transcends past and present for its own weird dimension its moments like these where excels is more of the same this time with an irascible energy flash streak to it and is even further out there again the name is a bit of a red herring is certainly noisy and inciting but at a manageable bpm anything old-school rotterdam is kept to the minute details like a seasoning used to spice things up on the other hand puts its heritage brazenly on show theres a strong uk flavour to it with those hardcore stabs going off like catherine wheels throughout yet its dangerously close to speedy js defining hit thing your mind one of the most famous records to ever come out of rotterdam both tracks sample vocals from chantals the realm but the resonance goes much deeper that kind of flattery is all well and good but stranger would be better off showing more of himself
like his long-term studio collaborator ethyl jamie taylors productions as roam the hinterland between house and techno his sound is warm but not cloying stripped down but far from simplistic nd as his second solo ep for vividly displays its very very deep taylor has solid credentials fter learning his trade playing at soul underground a long-running west midlands soul night run by his parents he embarked on a sound engineering and production course (where he met ethyl) this may explain his adroitness with rhythm and percussion snares impact with a hefty punch hi-hats have a satisfying crunch the groove it seems is everything on tightly wound toms and gnarled kicks are eventually draped in a synth veil before the drums once again take over s a wonderfully woozy mid-afternoon terrace kinda tune the tool-like which is heavy on the woodblocks and analogue bass takes the tempo down lives up to its billing by juxtaposing jabbering percussion and galloping hi-hats with malevolent minor keys taylor may have soul deep in his heart but his music has a deliciously dark coating
the second release finally comes almost exactly an entire year after footcrab one of 2010s biggest crossover smashes the man otherwise known as headhunters second release digs deeper into his obsession with vintage electro all but doing away with the footwork references is a fiery apocalypse of rancid squelch and demonic vocals the sound of the world ending one destroyed rave at a time (where the vocal sample begins to sound more like the command of a sadistic slave driver than a call to dance) with its toy 808 rimshots ringing out into a vast foreboding abyss its the reverb that really makes the track as sounds stretch out and define the gaping chasm easing up on the fallout vibes is lighter on its feet soothing keyboard tones feeling out its jazzy progression while its stabbing drums and clipped vocals are bound to garner comparisons to footcrab the rolling twitch is more sped-up miami ass than anything else while these tracks do date back to around the same time as footcrab the much-delayed release shows the producer who arguably brought juke to the forefront of bass music already moving on
began back in 2002 now at beginning of 20 we are edging towards completed picture function regis silent servant and female have never actively pursued anonymity: the nebulous hue cast over ir label was merely an information drought few would have known before last year for instance that functions involvement in techno stretched back 20 years ; silent servant has a record-shelf stacked with post-punk and industrial ; and regis role in label is to disrupt proceedings and from an aes tic standpoint this first album as is as close to total product as label has ventured the pair of clear vinyl on which albums nine tracks are pressed are accompanied by a fanzine of john mendez (silent servant) artworks and an additional 7-inch most pertinently though -forward represents first full exploration of sound world recurrent mes ominous strings jagged synths metallic reverb have revealed mselves across labels two dozen or so releases and are re in spades on album opener but -forward s real triumph is in transpositions of established framework few contemporary producers have bettered inexorable techno blueprint laid down by collective but here its used as a mere jumping off point from which to scale emotional register smacks of (substantial syn sized string section brittle drum sounds) yet it touches a poignant early 90s nerve hi rto unfelt with group portends ambient menace but it quickly gives way to hope even in its fleeting appearance serene 30-second synth solo that closes track is stunning finishes album by flirting with noise-fuelled delirium before pulling back from precipice and tumbling into an e real sound wall despite experimental expositions though -forward is still ostensibly a techno album the second part of three-part opening piece calls to mind sheds crackling chords and low-end rumble; part three presents albums most palpable paean to berghain while far from breathtaking offers alternate cadences and texture through its woody mid-range and sinister synths although its on tracks like that techno purview is broadened again cut bears distinguishable scars but when before were you invited to feel euphoric in ir company regis in particular has talked about labels desire to escape perceived disposability of techno by packaging a projects complete and unrestrained vision and in both sight and sound -forward is a total immersion in deep from a broader perspective you could argue that in this regard collective are simply aping ir diy post-punk era influences but in a modern day when most things are easy free and instant looking to past is probably best way of eliciting an imagined future
ive not been sleeping well and isnt helping lying awake listening to this album i feel its confidence the work that has gone into creating this strange private world but also its anxiety a nervous tick runs through it in the dark the fidgiting of hallucinogenic exploration and great expeditions conducted entirely in the mind take a track like where the chords twitch and shimmer around a beat thats always threatening to congeal but never really does this suspension makes the moments of impact in particular even more spectacular these tracks have a genuine weight when they hit like bodies colliding they feel like concentrations of the diffuse energy that swirls through the other tracks not a change of gear but a matter of shading progression within the tracks or even across the album as a whole is far less important than how a texture feels at any given moment the ever-present tape hiss the way the bass blooms on tracks like and the ambient cesspool of these are sounds that reward some wallowing theres always something hidden further in the murk (if only you could wade a little deeper it might become clear) filled with noise and hiss discordant stabs distant piano and almost subconscious kick drums is the apex of this approach feeling warm despite its incongruous density its far from an unpleasant place to spend seven minutes so it goes for the rest of the record: what begins as enigmatic or even alienating ends up familiar and welcoming a track like gives the sense that gamble works with his nose pressed against his material so close and focused on the details still he doesnt get lost in them and is refreshingly unafraid to think in a literal sense about the bigger picture gambles music to date has felt like it was made entirely by and for the head like his thought processes remained scarred into the work itself explicit and inescapable defining factors his last two albums diversions 1994-1996 and dutch tvashar plumes were possessed of great feeling and ingenuity but has something extra a burgeoning physicality an intuitiveness a stronger blend of the body and the mind morton feldman once wrote about watching mark rothko stretch canvas in his studio trying to find that particular scale which suspends all things in equilibrium with gamble has found a canvas thats just the right size to fit everything on to hold the whole beautiful thing up at once
s just-left-of-center sound continues on their newest ep underneath s beat it sounds like someone is determinedly scouring the floor back and forth for six minutes straight nd then right as a 303 line comes in so does rosina few rosinas actually she coos in one ear and belts it out in the other creating a disorienting moment of frisson res another one when it takes ten seconds after someone yells its party time for the beat to come back in during the breakdown it shouldnt be much of a surprise: tracks rarely go in the way that you expect them to even the self-proclaimed bangers label boss dam takes the -side offering up a dub of the original unlike many tracks with a similar name it actually does sound like it was recorded in an enormous empty space uses 303 and rosina accents to create a tension that is never resolved (in a good way )
in production terms future times boss has had a remarkably fertile couple of years its almost as if hes working with different materials to everyone else: not synths and drums but their play-doh substitutes soft and malleable and primary-coloured on the shaping ep for jordan gczs label his sculptures reach new heights of gooey sophistication might be named for the synth tones that periodically scurry out from behind its robust house groove its melodies curve and bend weirdly as if peered at in shallow water is more melancholy but no less seductive; its groove flexes wonderfully between halftime swing and stuttering percussive pile-up elsewhere things get more extreme might once have been a muscular drum track but its been gently warmed until its half-melted into rubbery puddles by contrast tones down the percussion all the better to show off maxs melodies as usual for him they seem to be 10 melody and 90 fidgety improv; when you cant decide which shape is best why not throw them all into the mix

the portuguese duo of mr groove vergas team up on wallop limited to deliver a 3 track release with the original mix is a classic release you can see the likes of roger sanchez and armand van helden playing the track flows very smoothly with some solid basslines and some pretty standard drums and percussion the vocal plays a very strong role in this mix flowing through the track pretty much all the way with saxophone interludes coming into the track when the vocal subsides the big room mix takes a chunkier approach with some pretty groovy bassline tones as well as a host of filtered effects and subtle vocal lines the flow is pretty strong throughout living up to its name as a big room track the radio edit as the name would suggest is a shortened edit of the original mix jam packing as much as the vocal and saxophone sounds into a 4 minute track not a bad release here a release that doesn t really bring anything new to the game but it does do things well especially in the big room mix
depths of abandon described on s friends values blog include discussions about fly fishing fitness regimes and recommendations for some nice comfortable cushions those mature sophisticated pastimes would make ideal accompaniments for large parts of his new album after more than a decade of living in berlin offermann has said he needs time away from sleepless nights in clubs but still has house music at its heart album is inspired by new age music meditation and veganism but its more fun than that might make it sound even in its most reflective moments offermanns vocals can echo the sort of banal platitudes youd find in a self-help philosophy book but theyre never preachy and never dominate the music s new age influences come through in synths like the one on which sounds stuck on the sort of setting a space rock band like ozric tentacles might have used with its crisp beats and bubbling electronics that track is like electro in a floatation tank echoing the hip-hop offermann used to produce same goes for the quasi-boom-bap of but most of is a mellower version of the house and techno hes put out on his own wh te label and imprints like aim firmly in the vein of 2012 debut lp do pilots still dream of flying offermann can be imaginative with only a few ingredients having restricted his studio setup to cheap drum machines and synths he only rarely throws in unexpected elements like the distorted guitar at the end of carols and prefers instead to get a range of moods and textures out of basic 4/4 rhythms punchy basslines feathery synths and vocal loops res deep early-hours house on hypnotic techno on banunas ticklish electronic grooves on and slo-mo shuffling on n theres the tender piano on which ends the album on a melancholy note is not much of a progression from its predecessor but that dreamy melodic house sound is still just as good for cutting a rug as sitting on one
next up on the italian based mo-do is a release from andrew k pres junk science and it features 3 mixes of the 144mph mix flows very nicely throughout thanks mainly to some smooth string patterns subtle melodies and some intensely paced beats but for me the track lacks a bit of direction and although it flows quite nicely it just misses the boat the 44mph mix is essentially a stripped down version of the 144mph mix and to be honest i think it actually sounds better as a downtempo production as it flows quite nicely without the beats niki b christian effe add their touch to the release on the flip and for me they turn in a slightly disappointing mix it is nice in parts but again much like the a-side it lacks a strong sucker punch
record reviews are typically something we turn to for advice on whats either deserving or not deserving of our hard earned scratch the release in question here though a nominally holiday themed limited edition 7 inch from dance vinyl mega retailer juno happens to be free and my guess is you wouldnt need too much help pulling the trigger on a split from and regardless of its monetary value e that as it may im here to tell you about the inch: a heavyweight release it is not but theres very little here to argue with lands on the side and while im not sure what has to do with christmas im certainly not complaining the track finds falty in something like idle hands ish techno mode though as with most tracks from this rooklynite his fingerprints are all over the thing on the flip gives us perhaps the only hypnagogic ambient composition specifically related to christmas in existence neither track is either producers absolute finest work but what scrooge out there is going to turn his nose up at a more or less handmade gift from a pair of dance musics finest nd in the case of the side you may find this 7 inch sticking around your bag long after youve taken the tree out to the curb
t may be hard fully to comprehend in this post-glitch age but vals markus popp is one of recent electronic musics most elusive and significant revolutionaries rising to prominence in the mid-90s when the second and third val albums systemisch and diskont 94 sketched a new paradigm for electronica popp is as much known for the forbidding discourse of his projects which approached generative art by seizing softwares mistakes as hidden intentions as he is for the labyrinthine beauty of his music diskont 94 s do while may be the perfect example an ever-changing aerial view of brilliant-cut digital detritus but popp reached real critical mass later with the process pre/commers and commers trilogy where he all but disappeared into the machinery mission accomplished or so it seemed ts been nine years since commers and seven years since the lone so album popps collaboration with japanese singer eriko toyoda n he has made up for this silence by releasing not only available as a 70-track double- or 7 -track double-lp-and-download but the 5-track h -inch and two free ringtones download eps thats over 00 tracks of new val which is a lot to wade through even though a good portion of it barely scrapes past the one-minute mark f val phase one was a critical response to the directive nature of software and digital technology phase two feels in part like either a capitulation to or commentary on the mp3 eras encouragement of glut economics either way at a certain point exhaustion sets in; there is simply too much val on offer wading through my first impression is one of clarity gone are the waves floods and overflows of digital noise that characterised diskont 94 or commers nstead popp has turned to a readily made instrument a pc composing tiny melody fragments or fragile chordal movements and seemingly subjecting them to relatively understated processing so while the language of glitch which popp helped create is still in some small way present his musical logic now feels exposed popp was always a master of texture and much of sounds lovely in an oddly plastic pro-forma way springy glassy threads of tone jolt and bustle between your ears while stretched strained and jumpy notes trickle along in the background f its generative its closer to the character of the wind chime endless variations on several distinctive sounds than the maze of complexity that characterised some of the records released by early val and its peers sometimes falls flat: on the first disc of the double- set half of the tracks are punctuated by programmed drums which detract from the streamlined focus of the music leading val into drearily post-rock territory the second disc made up of fifty miniatures is slightly more compelling journal entries to the first discs essays theyre oddly charming feeding into the ringtone logic thats informing popps current practice is a welcome return for popp one of electronic musics most quixotic characters true to form its also an experiment and experiment begets both failure and success s seeming failure lies more in its overwhelming scope than its content though the latter cant help but suffer diminution resulting from the former quite like popps new pop although ve had rather too much of it lately f anything the cover of the preceding h -inch a photograph of celeste boursier-mourgenots from here to ear installation where zebra finches perch uncertainly on an electric guitar feels like the best comment on popps form the gentle insistent pecking away at the old order using its own tools to bring his personal vision into the new age r maybe its just the natural world confronting the musical instrument on a human/animal scale
usually gets saddled with the sound design tag and usually its pretty accurate french stable member however has always fallen nearer to techno techno with impeccable sound design of course his past work for the label has been swung and slightly abstract but pentaki slopes his first appearance on since his 2011 album or sees him going straight for the floor the ep includes two massive nine-minute tracks and which i assume are meant to be polar opposites of each other the former lunges forward with just a slight spring in its step as if david letellier couldnt bear to lay down a flat beat wisps of synth coil from the churning furnace beneath the mark of his polished production but as it peters out into three minutes of meandering with his ambition gets in the way its a fine track but nowhere near his best fortunately sets things right it takes a while to rumble to a start with its marc romboy-esque gurgling but just when you think its going to be a grimy sewer-scraper a shimmering chord emerges with a determined chug like some old trance track covered in rot its one of the most evocative letellier productions laid to wax and also one of the most danceable
eight tracks to paraphrase british comedy genius tony hancock thats nearly an album full but no the co-founders first single of is a double ep despite totaling 43 minutes its also further proof that kevin mcauleys music which has been informed by such a range of electronic music influences edges closer to trad techno with every release but as its this is techno of a unique strain thats apparent from the outset as game vividly and vocally exhibits atop a dissipated jerky techno/hip-hop hybrid rhythm missy elliott opines do your thang just make sure you ahead of the game is a further manifestation of that credo; beatless for the first half save for a kick drum-free steam train rhythm it features hollowed out proto-synth chords la electronic pioneer delia derbyshire before offering up some distorted sub-bass on mcauley invokes the spirit of early hardcore in its sound textures albeit with its heartbeat slowed to bedtime pace in contrast is perhaps the danciest track here a frantic snare peppering the unwavering 140+ bpm techno kick if someone told you in a blind taste challenge that it was by scottish techno pioneer neil landstrumm you wouldnt question them and weve only reached the midway point the second half opens up with the itchy whipcracking while features a snare that strides its length in giant steps populated by ravey sped-up vocal drops and wah-wah synth stabs manages to pull off the trick of running several time structures at once; the top layer is an off-beat single drum thwack but its underpinned by light typewriter-style snare clicks and echoey tribal toms while a rudeboy bassline seems to decay with every drop and if such a monumental undertaking needed a tin hat putting on it then the twisted ambience of is just that its stretched-out primal scream helping to complete the majestic sublimely uncomfortable nightmare the sound of doing his thang then yep ahead of the game on this evidence most certainly
kick drum intro: how cute that straightforward quality permeates ristolian newcomer s debut 12-inch; hes young hes got some moves lets do this has that 2-steppy extra kick (literally and figuratively) that is funkys recent gift to uk bass but its macs sparse layering that makes the record move hes aiming for late 80s chicago as well as 10s rixton: every time always a woman sings in tandem with herself alternating with a cascading ti-i-i-ime ; its affirmative and nebulous together at once could fit into a deeper darker house set as well as one focusing on bassier stuff steroid elts the -side doesnt make any pretense toward bass music per se at all its straight-up house deploying a lot of analog sounds (not necessarily gear) to expand and contract in scratchy crackling lines over an insistent boom-sweep theres another womans vocal sample: oh-oh-oh-oh it goes echoed endlessly and faded out
mark jonathan rutherford known to followers of soma quality recordings as repeat repeat is (along with jamie kingett) the mastermind behind the latest snag for jackmasters juggernaut if the duos debut doesnt set you shooting through the sky then you may need to get your jet engines checked while plenty scoff at the term future bass these days im not sure theres a better way to describe this track: imagine yourself on a cigar boat 150 years from now weaving between half-sunk skyscrapers in a long-deserted new york city and youve basically got the point that the collection includes a girl remix suggests this thing isnt already a dead ringer for night slugs and rhythmically its right on that vibe but theres something seriously ambitious about s sonics though that catapults into an orbit all of its own so what can girl bring to a track that doesnt fall too far from his own tree the londoner ends up taking a streamlining approach hammering out the originals funkiness into something more direct but not really harder-hitting if the originals futuristic vision is kind of awesome girl s tomorrowland feels distinctively dystopian with sweet melodies trailing off in a doppler smear before they have the chance to register as catchy not surprisingly ctresss uraeus mix comes out of left-field: sleepy spare and whimsical its not so much a remix as a counterimage the enormous bass that takes over in the final third though will snap you out of whatever dreamstate youve been lulled into
by is quietly becoming a showstopper since appearing on deep dish s global underground moscow many djs have included any of the below tracks in their charts and track listings for sets beware the dub sessions have begun original dub deep pulsating beats assist the ride into a subliminal affair of dubby baselines and synths ultra smooth and ultra slick with stabbing piano chords and low whooping bass sounds controlling the whole track cooler dub upping the beat and groove which adapts more towards dance floors the cooler dub keeps the dubbiness and arrives more into house territory the addition of sharper synth hooks and sounds give it more of dancing feeling electric dub you may be thinking a third dub but the electric dub does what the others can t reaching towards electro sounding synths and bouncing beats the whole feeling of the other dubs is lost immediately but then the trademark baselines arrive bringing with it a fresh synth sound from the generic melody smith selway mix to round off a set of brillant dubs have been so generous in providing a thumping techno stormer from christian smith and john selway these boys add a ribbing percussion multiple variations of the melody over-lapping each other perfectly and a driving and relentless beat danny howells was so impressed he included it on his essential mix late 2002
theres a balance essential to much of modern dance music that does particularly well: just the right amount of club just the right amount of art its new one from feels a bit stuck between those poles but still meets the labels standard of striking music by up-and-coming artists based in london following a stint in berlin venturini runs a label called south london analogue material home to exquisitely brutal techno records from inspired newcomers like himself (absl ansome gaja sakes) along with two split eps as catch hes put out one 12-inch of his own a scuzzy left-field club record on the polish label bruta his second ep keeps that experimental edge but draws from a warmer more dreamlike sound the centerpiece of 14 is an 11-minute kaleidoscope of strings bleeps and pixelated whispers its split in two by a beat that arrives five minutes in at which point the track becomes a club remix of itself personally i like it better before this happens paired with a kick drum its glittering arrangement suddenly feels a bit twee though on the right dance floor it could make for a dazzling moment the other two tracks and are more abstract hazy floaters with a streak of melancholy reminiscent of actresss rip pretty as they are they dont quite get under your skin but in their boldness and strength of style they make venturini look like an artist capable of great things

still in his teens and yet another product of the seemingly bottomless bristol gene pool joe arthur debuts for kerri chandlers madtech with two cuts heavy on the bass pregnant with ideas and refreshingly raw in execution spends its first two minutes absorbed in rapid-fire wood blocks and claps and deep fuzzy kicks vocals exhibit an old-school garage quality pitched up and down with alacrity before the main thrust of the track kicks in introducing a flurry of latino cowbells and growling bass that brings to mind fellow bristolians outboxx and trevinos recent output res no sign of arthur holding back on on the it opens up with a dizzying flurry of kicks juke-style rhythms and a cut-up ghettotech rap settling eventually into a crunching stampede of bass synths combined with some of the cheeky edits that are scattered around his facebook page these two tracks suggest weve only scratched the surface of
the hoover dam the bay bridge the panama canal s megaprojects series counts massive public infrastructure projects as inspiration he looks to the -5 dam in quebec and the now-demolished orange county government center in upstate new york on its latest ep conjuring feelings of governmental can-do spirit and mid-century patriotism that now feel quaint geists idea on megaprojects is to make low-tech tracks with rudimentary synths and drum machines and elevate them into megaprojects with his mixdowns by stepping back to the mindset of his early solo releases geist playfully answers an age-old question: what if i knew then what i know now named after the dam succeeds with this directive as much a tutorial for young producers as it is a catchy disco-inflected house cut it starts with a skeletal arpeggiated synth and pads that could score a group of engineers looking over some blueprints after which snares hats and minimal leads billow into the mix as small building blocks that eventually amount to a towering structure the next couple tunes and fail to reach these satisfying heights the former is a low-slung sub-110-bpm head-nodder that never quite lifts off while the latter deals in humdrum 90s rave nostalgia albeit with fine detail and a spacious mixdown to close things out honors the building that inspired it with a mind-bending lead synth line over a metro area-style bassline
has shown an aptitude for unusual techno especially with cohorts gareth wild and chris stanford in eartogrounds early days londoner has never shied from his jungle and uk rave roots letting the sounds inform his dj sets and several eps along way (check out dreamscape on his first record the cheeky breaks in angel dust for deeply rooted and the sephora eps details ) this year hes taken a dive into driving acid producing some of his hardest-hitting stuff to date its all diverse and sprawling as it keeps a firm footing on the floor which is exactly what we get on its all here: the paced dreamy stuff ( ) something with a bit more bite ( ) an acid freak out ( ) and a slammer that touches on his vinyl-digging past ( ) res even a straight-up jungle track ( ) and a few moments where goes totally off road se are s highlights but there sadly arent enough tro orloks prises the lid open with a nice tumble down the rabbit hole but the jewel in the crown is for working strange chimes and timbres into a delightful club oddity that one takes on all sorts of weird shapes and yet its the most succinct product of s amalgams biggest fault with is how the elements separately vie for your attention instead of properly coalescing mixology is almost right but not quite take : it was deliberately made to jar with the mix firing off at strange angles but comes off sounding more awkward than functionally challenging altogether is missing the gum to glue it firmly together but on a track-to-track basis its more solid off-kilter techno from a producer unafraid to subvert conventions
fter more than a decade of releases under twenty pseudonyms is finally putting out records under his own name nd while his previous records have largely been uk garage he seems to have reserved his real name for a new sound: it should be noted however that faber cosmic isnt lindstr m cosmic instead the -side on this record falls in line with s commitment to pop (the imprints last release was on an italo tip with marc lmond on vocal duties ) you could call it video game disco i suppose because it s such dinky stuff: the beat to sounds like the moment that pitfall harry picks up the money bag in pitfall ( tari 1982) the synth melody meanwhile upgrades the track but only to mega man -era complexity (capcom 1987) this is not a criticism of course s any nintendo fan knows japanese game technicians were some of the greatest composers of the 80s the roy uchanan-style guitar work on doesn t have the same restrictions like strands of spaghetti spread across a desert sky its noodle-y and deliciously self-indulgent perfect for the cosmic context like the synthesizer that sprawled over hommage i from faber s previous 12-inch on this sounds like improv but most likely it s composed to within an inch of its life to its credit and this goes for as well neither sound worse for wear for being so studied; in fact both sides end up feeling like the loose and effortless 70s tracks theyre meant to evoke much like his excellent 2-step productions faber has mastered yet another genre the only question left what name next
famed sex researchers masters and johnson sought to de-emphasize the orgasm as the critical element in sex developing methods to help individuals embrace sex as a more varied sensory experience they called this sensate focus which is also what experimental powerhouse is calling its new house music offshoot no word on whos behind the labels first release number 0 in the catalog number aside this is sensate focuss debut but theyve crafted a record that picks up the thread of artists like like sasu ripatti (as luomo) and herbert who saw house not just as body music but as a legitimate forum for twists and turns both compositional and intellectual and thats where the sensate focus comes in: by shifting houses locus of power from the butt to the brain (without of course denying us our bodily pleasures) he/she/whoever has crafted some of the richest dance music of the moment its also to be a bit less sophisticated with the masters and johnson reference kind of a bedroom record with gloriously humid chords and steady thrust building to one final rippling moment on the b-side the record opens with a soft moan spurring on extended rhythmic tickling at a moment of truth the / beat eventually breaks down but with a playful smirk its picked back up in 7/8 a trick sure to make your toes curl (and give unrehearsed djs a panic attack) after the record is flipped the stakes run higher: you can almost hear the sweat dripping off its climbing melody with a digital sizzle as it hits the floor nearing the runout the key modulates and the beat stutters slightly signaling the finish of a house excursion as likely to raise your heart rate as it is your iq
there are familiar ideas in jkerian morgans music but theyre rarely left undamaged rather than working within existing genres morgan takes templates and smashes them against the wall letting the resulting splatter form a sort of musical rorschach pattern as he shares a penchant for destruction with his fellow residents from janus a roving berlin party that emphasizes weirdness and otherness initially known for his love of r b and pop s music took a darker turn around the time januss monthly event ended resulting in the tortured 27-minute collage damsel in distress morgan described the free release as a cry for help and a clean slate and his debut for follows in its footsteps is a confrontational ep opener is laced with antagonistic tones as if in listening to it youve triggered an intruder alarm the title track turns the infamous masters at work ha (a ballroom staple) into a cloud that hovers over hissing gaskets and turning gears while the rat-at-at attack of is just as erratic and both of which bring to mind fellow newbie rabit in their use of blank space and reverb offer a zero-gravity respite though theyre still crunchy and foreboding as a dj i want people to dance but i also want them to be a little bit unsure of whats going on most of the time morgan told ra in a recent feature judging from that goes for his productions too over its 20 minutes the ep pushes dance music through violent twists and turns until it becomes disorienting and startling
in the past gary becks output has tended towards very drumcode-ish sounds indeed hes even released with them as fans of the imprint would know its artists are generally fond of loops insistent percussion and bold low-end on his own label beck has clung to this aesthetic even more so take away the vocals on aprils s in mine for example; the result is a barrelling freight train becks version of is a bit of a departure from this one which shows the hand of speedy j for one it doesnt really have a bassline instead a benign but persistent synth swells up in the off beats where a hi-hat would usually go thus the hi-hats form a kind of rustling backdrop for the rest of the track rather than being a rigid force in their own right using these basic elements beck teases them together and apart occasionally bringing in some swooshes and siren-like noises for effect edit s dub smooths down the off-beat synth even more turning it into a timid organic pulse though becks piece doesnt quite have the impetus of most drumcode tracks it still has plenty conversely edit s piece focusses more on atmospherics slowing the siren-like noises to a gassy trickle and floating ever upward
parisian paul r gimbeau k has spoken of his recent work being influenced by black metal and its hard not to notice its presence throughout his debut its three tracks are concerned with stark contrasts between light and shade and prioritise atmosphere over dance floor functionality the closing moments of lead track offer a good example fter relentlessly bludgeoning the listener for five minutes with iron-plated kicks and furnace-roar ambience the mood abruptly flips: the music lapses into near silence and a lonely chorus of brass instruments drifts into earshot ending on a melancholy but distinctly hopeful note equally theres a gothic grandeur to all low-end throb clashing static rising strings and disembodied choral song listening to these tracks as standalone artefacts its not easy to imagine dancing to them: a lack of high-end percussion strips them of propulsion and they frequently lapse into periods of quiet that said theres an elasticity to s beats that makes them deceptively funky and in the right djs hands theyd doubtless prove fiercely effective in a club setting that doesnt really feel like the point though as exists on the margins of what you might define as dance music its strongly influenced by the harder ends of techno but uses it as a tool with which to approach broader compositional ideas that encompass metal post-punk and even soundtracks
its easy to imagine the title im lright as a response to larry mccarthys last release the trouble with wilderness wistful breakup record the ep saw mccarthy wearing his heart on his sleeve with tender broken beats on im lright the man better known as returns to his usual sound with inventive drum programming stop-start songwriting and wiry fx that make for disorienting dance music y now theres something of a recognizable formula but mccarthy shakes it up enough to keep things fresh im lright features happy drums and stretchy springy synths it wouldnt be out of place in an objekt set the tracks all about fake-outs: on two separate occasions cuts the volume only to bring everything back in which is especially gratifying once the squall comes after the second dropout im lright is visceral and satisfying a counterpoint to the floaty weirdness of records like steals mccarthy sinks into a sleepier state on which creeps like an oil slick across the ocean surface the way the tracks low-key drums keep the momentum going without a kick is addictive to say nothing of the weird sounds that bloom over top in a ristol scene already packed with artists cleverly dismantling techno im lright is further proof that mccarthy belongs at the top of the heap
next up on who i must confess have been pretty solid lately is a release by with their track entitled alongside the original mix comes a remix from transformer man who s release on re:connect in 2003 was a solid outing for the chunky breakbeat master the original mix is quite a minimal breakbeat in production by that there are no real obvious sounds or hook that grab you there is pretty solid baseline that lurks below the production for the most part and the drums are pretty active throughout in terms of arrangement there is a hefty breakdown midway that sees some twists in the effects as well as some slight atmospheric elements the transformer man mix on the b-side is indeed quite sturdy in the chunky department pretty solid breakbeat drums are surrounding by deep analogue baselines that give the track a pretty meaty outlook an electro synth pattern runs rife throughout the production playing a major role in the track after the intro of the first few minutes all in all though the track flows quite nicely and has the tough baseline edge you come to expect from transformer man not a bad release by with transformer man s remix probably edging it between the two
with roots in renegade parties (and later a space residency) in ibiza vitalik has typically gravitated towards relatively summery flavors of deep house but the label takes a sharp turn into wintrier climes with the latest release on its vinyl-only offshoot vitalik gold series the lush pads of franklin de costas are just luminous enough to warm your hands to but a chilly heart still beats at the center of this steel-plated slow-moving beast minor key bass arpeggio slinks through desiccated hi-hats and claps and contrapuntal lines frequently spin off into shivery tangents; the analog-inspired sound design strikes a position somewhere between levon vincent and conforce twisting and morphing it all shuffles along at a numbing 112 beats per minute but it never lacks for muscle thanks to tough drums and a vibrant sense of swing; its an elegant unusual take on slow-motion space techno nonyms remix brings us back up to a more conventional dance floor clip filing the drums down to a silvery hiss of rides and crisp claps and drawing out those gaseous pads for nearly nine-and-a-half minutes of ethereal dubbed-out bliss
theres a lovely drawing on s myspace of what seems to be a woman with only a gaping hole in her face oozing some sort of multi-colored fluid onto a floor which is covered in the stuff the producers first single sounds a little bit like that illustration: recognizable forms abound a synth poking out a little melody a guitar chucking in its rhythmic pulse a bassline that arrives to save the day (with piano chord in tow) but in the end its all just a little bit of a mess thats likely what k matthew waites wanted out of his track but instead of deliciously sludgy mess everything seems to be fighting for attention nd when those aforementioned piano chords come in as if to clear away the forest once and for all it simply seems like one more thing to deal with rather than a relief the rontosaurus boys are the flip honorees simplifying by isolating details and giving them their proper due s anyone who has seen them live can attest this is the sort of track that comes alive when they place it around similar tunes but here it comes off limp neither builder nor primetime player lame the mix: it sounds for much of its length as though theyre playing in separate rooms rare mis-step from the usually stellar
fter releasing a string of records from his peers in 2012 has decided its high-time he put something out himself the first lets play release of the year comes from the labels co-founder and a long overdue appearance it is; this is renaults first new original material in three years backed up here with a debut remix from french duo paradis to finds renault in a slightly less playful mood than long-term followers may have come to expect gone are the exuberant percussive breaks and lavishly splashed streaks of neon replaced by tempered mildly melancholy disco loops and echoing toms sepia-toned rather than high-definition not that this makes it any less engaging the filtered loop panning left and right may have a vaguely soporific effect but its one youre only too happy to roll with the real joy on the package however is the remix from paradis setting you up for an entirely pleasant ride with a bed of breathy male oohs and aahs its complementing basslines may catch you off guard with the force of their conviction the first bellows at a subterranean level warming you to the core while the second introduces an abyssal gurgle

its a precarious thing to call a release nothing is worth the hype after all you wouldnt want people to think its something not worth talking about conversely it could be understood that the music speaks for itself strangely enough the four tracks here seem to walk the same edge sometimes showing potential for mediocrity but mostly veering away s vibration exemplifies this most at first it can seem lazy but immersion reveals it to be a plastikman esque exercise in repetition that is slightly experimental with testing how far he can take a kick bassline and two note screech using little more than filters the longer it runs the more entrancing it becomes opposes this frenzied oscillation with a slow stepping beat question and answer style melody and a range of classy effects listening to a short sample it would be easy to mistake it for something unimaginative the a side contains the most powerful track on the release s it doesnt just achieve this title solely with intensity either theres a carefully crafted sense of tension; the kind that drives a dance floor wild the usual bass drop is here but its augmented by a sustained pad and washy ride cymbal which holds off on until the final quarter last comes pan pots vocal edit of which includes new vocals but sadly none of the swagger of the original the brooding mood it tries hard to establish never quite eventuates worth the hype on three out of four occasions certainly
since records put out their first track loops lights dimensions from coldfish its delivery of underground sounds has being swift with a respectable four releases already notched up now for their fifth instalment comes a track thats been doing the rounds for the best part of a year - from lithuanian producer raimundas macevicius aka also gets two fresh remixes the original mix holds a potent groove of heavily delayed sounds ontop of forceful beats ever so gradually a smooth mystical combination of airy pads and stuttering percussion ease their way dropping out the beat momentarily as the emotion swells up this repeats again taking it further chopping up the pads slightly as they dissipate leaving a low slung beat tweaking before powering ahead till the end the simuck breaks mix takes the original parts and turns out events at a slower pace with filtering melody lines and tight broken rhythms along with a range of sparkling sounds easing the mood into a more pensive setting last up is a debut from slovenian blaz vrecko with the organic function remix complete with a foot stompin arrangement of forceful gritty drum patterns along with skipping percussion that gets us moving while subtle elongated sounds work about underneath maybe taking its time to make its point but a neat rework
the next release on comes from argentina from a man who received strong support from his last release on sinister back in 2004 this time he delivers and it sees a remix from dobbs on the flip the original mix is quite a smooth breakbeat journey beginning with some crisp beats and a gritty bassline the track progresses nicely as atmospheric elements come more into the track combined with a smooth and melodic set of tones not a bad production with a pretty solid progression and flow the dobbs remix has a great flow to it from the word go the beats are a little more intense and flow more smoothly while the basslines are strong with this remix driving the track along very nicely there is a little funky riff to the track which combines well with the original melodies and the effects that dobbs has implanted in this solid remix not a bad release here for sinister with the dobbs remix on the flip being just the stronger production
its an invasion with plastic rayguns baobinga and napt both had released critically acclaimed slabs of wax on plastic raygun and now theyve just handed over two tunes for the freestylers reckon its the best release on so far and have commissioned line like this to appear on their new fabriclive cd side a baobinga i d - the feeling the feeling combines rave style female (more like chipmunkish) vocals with tough percussive breaks acid stabs and melodic acid bassline (with a hint of old skool thrown in for good measure) theres plenty of variation in this tune with intelligent drum patterns (switching rhythms between straight up 4/4 time signature breakbeat to 6/8 swingtime to militant jungle and back again) and baobinga incorporates clever use of filters and effects on the vocals and instruments during build ups and breakdowns side b napt - line like this feat sharkie p line like this on the flip side is a epic string laden garage breaks number napt throw down an apache-esque bongo drum fill and an electro hook before hitting the speakers with a slamming bass hook hard synths and monstrous hoovers while garage mc sharkie p provides the vocal hook and title of the tune
theres old-school imitation and then theres perhaps its his close proximity to the uk funky scene that allows him to instil a welcome freshness and candour into records that at first glance could have been released 20 years ago or perhaps hes just massaging our aural g-spots with outrageously catchy hooks that duplicitously forbid any criticism of reactionary music making however hes doing it matt cutler is rightly one of the years most sought-after artists and his most sought-after release pored over ever since kode 9 placed it at the head of his dj-kicks table six months ago its finally here with bells on it like a coma cat for the rave generation the melodys a shower-solo success to be sure but equal measures of frenzy can be drawn from cutlers rampageous switches from broken beats to straight with added punch on the ones and twos as he does so its a device he exploits further in which with a rattletrap lead line that patrick dams might have written had he been a raver will have you momentarily questioning which is really the choice here ( but its closer than expected ) the remixes seem superfluous the original material is strong enough not to need bolster and neither the soca beat of sinden nor the sleep house of midland takes it in a direction thats as desirable as s retroasis
line how did we get so lonely is repeated so often on s that you almost want to climb into bed and never get out almost exactly 37 minutes later troxler sing-speaks the words do get inside of you on and you want to do exactly the same thing is the first song on the berlin-based duos new full-length comes eighth y are the starting points for two very different albums which one hits harder may just be down to the mood that youre in getting ready for the party hope it takes you a while will ease you into the mood a quirky entry into the beat-driven second-half of which immediately follows ups the groove and tones down the subtlety jettisons the latter altogether opting for a night in cant ask for a warmer or craftier set of dance floor-leaning tunes than the first seven is the only one that kicks like a mule but its also the shortest of the bunch is abundantly clear in each half though is that ali and basti schwarz are well and truly capable of something far greater than recently imagined while theyve been djing in clubs putting out mix cds releasing unremarkable dance floor fodder and generally continuing to build their brand by doing the right things its been easy to forget how they got here in the first place string of remixes they put in the early part of the decade were brilliant cracked pieces of electro house that didnt make you feel ashamed of the term weird enough to stand out functional enough to destroy a floor ll hear the duo veer off to one side or another often on but as a whole it serves as a long overdue reminder of what has made them so special whether it be the soft pump behind the quickly plucked guitar on or moving left right up and down and daring you to find her it seems that the album format has given the duo a purpose in the studio td be a shame if it took another five years for them to do it again

seattle label orac has been plugging away at expressive idm-influenced techno for half a decade now its most famous son is runo pronsato one of my favourite producers at the moment and you would do very well to check out orac09 if youre looking for smart haunting micro techno a software engineer by day is fishing in the same waters but the title track from the latest 12-inch on the label is less groove than bad mood uilt around a groaning male voice warps and whistles it adds up to a late morning curled up in the corner of the club on ket mcmillion swears by warp material such as squarepusher and the influence shows the track is too harsh and metallic to find its way onto many decks quenum from cadenza injects some much needed body into his more straightforward techno remix falling nicely between being inviting and overpowering this one highlights vocal snippets glitchy keys and nervousness this edit would really warm the crowd into a dark and deep mood its a bit like something off alex smokes paradolia: techy industrial tinged with just the right amount of bite rounds up the release but unfortunately it sounds like a paul van dyk studio offcut confused by too many samples and wispy synths pushed in random directions of the three quenum wins by a country mile if you spin harder parties attended by harder folks his remix is a brooding bad boy that could be a useful mixing tool
bet you didnt think the future sound of 8 mile was going to be moombahton the mid-tempo electro/reggaeton fusion pioneered by d c s dave nada and championed by diplo its an odd phenomenon; like skweee it feels less like a genre than a meme but detroits seems bent upon changing that his debut ep moombahton mixes vol 1 set the likes of katy bs on a mission and dj funks theres some hoes in this house against slow snapping snares and loping percussion dirtier and more narcotic than its peers this the inaugural release on the label treads the same sub-110 bpms and uses the same dem bow snare patterns but it sounds like a significant step forward where s bootlegs wallowed in dirty synths theres a newfound clarity and even delicacy to the sawtooths in and dont their fluorescent arpeggios and fizzy chords paying woozy tribute to zomby rustie and dubsteps purple contingent meanwhile verges upon floating points full-spectrum rush with smooth jazzy changes and an unusually buoyant groove the buzzing dubstep experiment 1 is less distinctive while definitely returns to the dark gnarled sound of his bootlegs ep all cavernous rave stabs and corrosive bass growl
is still a relatively young producer in his early 20s and with about half a dozen productions already seeing release he is moving onto veteran status in his young years already seeing releases on labels such as grounded sondos progress inn and chug returns this time to australian label eq grey with and brings along with him a very tasty remix by west philly boys tigerhook corp on the a-side is the original mix from the outset i will say that this is a slightly disappointing production the track maintains a very similar pattern throughout and despite some nicely arranged drum patterns the production is a little too monotonous there is a slightly interesting breakdown midway that introduces some nice effects but all in all it s a little disappointing from a producer who has released some high quality material in the past on the flip is a remix by the very impressive tigerhook s burning chron mix from the outset the drum patterns are more unique than the original little vocal snippets float in and out early in the track but as the kick goes out midway into the track it returns with a nicely developed baseline that gives the production a nice little edge the production builds into a fusion of fantastic drum patterns as a nice loop of effects also adds an interesting twist into the remix deep into the track all in all it s a release saving remix from tigerhook that deserves a lot of credit they demonstrate their ability to turn a somewhat direction lacking production into an interesting fusion of sounds worth a look for this reason alone
is a legend of uk techno he founded ferox records which released dozens of well regarded records in the nineties before falling silent in the year 2000 s a producer gabriel has also built up an impressive discography of 12-inches albums and remixes that stretches from 1992 until about 2002 when he apparently got a bit disillusioned with the bosh-bosh techno that was popular back then and retired to frankfurt in short is top shelf stuff now did that sound in any way authoritative i hope not because the truth is that i d never heard of until last week in my defense i only started listening to techno this century and the techno coming out of the uk for the last few years just hasn t been very good (go on admit it) so somewhere along the line i must have decided that it made sense to just ignore the whole country well it turns out 90s uk techno producers were pretty good judging by this 12-inch which turns out to be gabriel s first in five years what a comeback it is oth sides of this excellent 12-inch are all about the build the -side is the more upbeat of the two rising with a skipping rhythm and long carl craig strings to somehow just hang there for twelve minutes it s very detroit techno but there s also something plain and unadorned about it too a simplicity which nicely recalls fellow ritish isles producers like mark room or donnacha costello ut the -side is even better gain twelve minutes long this one is about very calmly and very deliberately modulating two synth riffs over and over until you re completely lost in the music not quite dub techno not quite detroit not quite minimal it s one of those rare and useful records that creates its own atmosphere which is understandable really considering that gabriel has been doing this since 1992 nyway whatever you call it it s unusual it zones you out and it s an essential listen nice to meet you

jim seaton has adopted as a new alias for this release on but it isnt a massive stretch from his releases as call super as he continues to pair pumping techno grooves with dreamy electronic filigrees even given the weight of its kick drums and all that clattering percussion detat s title track is lithe and fluid this is partly down to the silvery synth that wends through it both an earworm and a graceful counterpoint to the hard-edged percussion wide dynamic range makes detat succeed where so much other techno fails: instead of an onslaught of kicks and sustained high volumes the track waxes and wanes with breath-like elegance the tightly knit drum patterns and radiant synths of also complement one another nicely and contrast well with a splattering of bleeps and a gritty bassline gain subtlety is key the spartan opening of there will e a time is a stark contrast to the plaid-like sheen of the other tracks but it doesnt take long for it to start spitting and fizzing as if its about to burst from its seams
you cant envy too pop to be taken seriously by the classical world too classical to break through completely to the electronic world: hes stuck making beautiful music that always ends up as wallpaper to someone in a way this makes him perfectly primed for the world of soundtracks a medium that from the off positions itself in a middleground of memorability and ignorability the berlin-based composer has successfully walked the tightrope for years releasing achingly beautiful solo material via fatcats 0 0 imprint and lending his hand to the work of others perhaps most notably for ra readers alongside roni size and the future sound of london ever since the release of his ringtone exploration postcards in full colour though hes largely turned his attention to soundtracks is the culmination of one of them a -minute work padded out to 0 that in its original form provided the musical backing to a 00 royal ballet performance sitting at home youd be hard-pressed to isolate which sections have been extended which are outtakes and which were originally included is a remarkably cohesive work in both sound and feel richters sound palette is generally similar to the one that he has used in past works it often sounds far more intimate however with the slow-moving violin pushed to the fore on were confronted with a private lament rather than the massed pathos of something like memoryhouse s last days or the the blue notebooks s tidy dirge on the nature of daylight other writers have noted the uncertain quality of and theyre exactly right whereas before you felt like the sadness was just a bit too easy seems mature a work uninterested in blacks and whites this makes one of richters least immediate works but for a composer criticized for the middlebrow nature of his solo work it also sounds like a step in the right direction instead of aiming directly for the heart richter often shoots for areas around it because operates as only one part of a much larger work it has to when he becomes the center of attention as he does on the overbearing he settles into routine when he pits radio crackle against bending tones that dont immediately make your tear ducts start welling he unlocks a different sort of potential
the centre cannot hold was meant to be an experiment n frost wanted to see what would happen if he relinquished control of the recording process of an album would it still be his the record was in safe hands; steve lbini is one of the finest engineers in the business and an all-time hero of frosts but the subsequent us elections cast the lp in a new and eerily prescient light frost who was in the states as the results came in remembers the chaos that ensued and the collective uncertainty over what a future with donald trump might entail the centre cannot hold is a deeply unsettled record driven by a quivering unpredictable energy it now relates to the instability of the times but the lp was finished well before trump became president frost has strong political views but he is careful to keep them separate from his work he wants everyone to be able to engage with his music no matter their beliefs his ongoing collaboration with photographer richard mosse and cinematographer trevor tweeten has brought him into contact with the conflict in the democratic republic the congo war in syria and iraq and the global refugee crisis ll of these experiences seep into the centre cannot hold violence is everywhere on the album from the track titles ( ll ) to the music itself via sudden earth-shattering detonations and searing sonic flashes these add up to a harsh listening experience but the centre cannot hold is also very beautiful even delicate at times take 100 a twinkling seconds-long reset between the maelstrom of and the crashing tides of eurydices the track is one of the calmest on the album is significant it forces us to take a moment to consider the title and what it might mean out in the world right now guitar chords add an undercurrent of emotion making the more abstract parts of the centre cannot hold easier to connect with theres and two lush ambient guitar pieces that resonate on a visceral subconscious level other tracks use shocking dynamics and sound design to provoke a more immediate response both are important in getting frosts message across its difficult not to hone in on the mericana subtext the us feels prevalent here with references to faith war celebrities and healthcare it was recorded in chicago too a long way away from the environment frost is used to in reykjav k where he lives but if his current show with mfo is anything to go by its the ocean or liquid thats the most fitting theme the centre cannot hold is about flux about the flow of change through cycles of destruction and serenity its a more hopeful record than you might think
restraint is the last thing anyone should expect from a collaboration between tiga and zombie nation but their latest single together takes things down a peg to fit with chunky uk-style house at least for the first half has that inimitable tiga strut with spitting vocal snippets and overdriven 303 bulking up the techy template the duo finally let loose in the breakdown: the vocal stretches out in full across banging pianos and tidal waves of bass its a stunning way to fragment the tracks zoned-out groove y the time it reassembles itself sounds like a different tune altogether mangled and malfunctioning like the burning wreckage of what came before thatd be a hard act to follow for anyone and indeed the duo half-ass it on the -side (labelled bonus beats ) sy em 700 is a handful of percussive ideas strung together full of big drum rolls and white noise streaks with no payoff

sean hernandez best known to the techno cognoscenti as doesnt come off like a new producer so much as one who aroy dee recently discovered under a thick sheet of dust though hes a relatively new talent with a knack for conjuring the old school he manages to feel more of a piece with his lineage than so many young guns arming themselves to the teeth with roland gear his last release for the aforementioned dutch producers m gt;o gt;s label kicked off their mos_deep series and now seven color vinyl slabs in returns to the imprint with more top notch vintage burners this time with a smile and few other likeminded soundsmiths in tow nothing on the ep constitutes a major departure for any entity involved but theres something in the mood here a sense of humor perhaps that feels special aroy dees edit of starts off on a very m gt;o gt;s buzzy acid tip before getting a rinse of sweetly dissonant sheets of synth produced with newcomer brings the funk by way of seriously simple but extremely effective drum machine programming and under his obsolete logy guise steven tang launches into space maintaining the originals funk while smearing its melody into a haze of bleeps and bloops lighthearted sure but this ep aint no joke

music is full of mysterious earworms tracks many people recognize but few actually know throughout the 90s a steady stream of these came from the studio of josh brent a producer from the isle wight better known as in his heyday brent released dozens of records under a few different names but it was his white labels that resonated the most as a whole the series established a sound thats still fresh some 20 years later and included a bundle of what you might call underground classics misspent years champagne dancer and nights among others at the end of 2015 the label sprang back to life to reissue these and other productions with a new ep coming every month or two so far the latest is a mini-collection that shows the duskier side of its easy to see why nights is one of brents most enduring records dark dubby and a bit rough-hewed it prefigured the cold house aesthetic of artists like levon vincent featured here is an alternate version of that track the only difference being an ever-so-subtle tweak in its most memorable detail the catchy bassline which gets a more stumbling rhythm on this one has a similar atmosphere cold and spacey with sonorous low-end but this one floats where jacks alienas taps into brents melancholic streak with mournful chords drifting over a chunky low-slung groove like everything in this welcome reissue series all three show an early blueprint for deep house thats barely been improved upon since
andrew lyster a resident and cofounder at the manchester club night meandyou is a quietly revered dj at least among the heads his sets tend to have an experimental and occasionally dark edge taking in obscure artists and flecks of post-punk noise and industrial without becoming too heavy or drab his new labels first release a collection of grizzled techno from the overlooked portland producer reflects his dj style: punchy and loaded with subtle eerie details three of s tracks have been previously released but they still sound fresh the records hardest tune the gurgling comes from a 2014 digital-only release while and are from 2007 is particularly strong weird and vaguely mystical its a broken techno track slathered in delay that coasts on a didgeridoo-like bassline that leaves the title track s only previously unreleased production its a stunning post-punk-influenced slice of techno full of ruddy drums and mucky bass the track is in-tune with a lot of contemporary techno but feels more spacious and dynamic with an unsettling atmosphere that might have something to do with s use of field recordings
with dub techniques having been adopted by all and sundry in electronic music circles since the mid-nineties its refreshing to see reggae take something back not that paul st hilaire the artist formerly known as tikiman has ever been firmly associated with either camp; rather since his emergence as vocalist with rhythm sounds mark ernestus and moritz von oswald st hilaire has acted as a bridge linking the dub-inflected electronica of basic channel chain reaction and pole with the more authentic traditional musics of jamaica and the caribbean fter rhythm sounds pioneering work with st hilaire many other mostly german producers began recruiting roots vocalists: mapstation hooked up with ras donovan; fenin took on mc gorbi; and rhythm sound on their latest see mi yah effort featured a different vocalist on each track divine state of mind ( dsom) st hilaires second solo album errs on the side of roots reggae but with its whirrs glitches and ounces of reverb ought to appeal equally to fans of dub electronica rhythmically it swaggers by at a leisurely rock-steady skank and while the drums appear to have been laid down digitally (st hilaire is credited as responsible for all composition production and instrumentation) theres a warm acoustic feel to even the most effected tracks fter his obvious skills as a vocalist most immediately impressive is st hilaires guitar work prevalent throughout and veering from clean short flurries to washed out streaks (its now clear who was responsible for the guitar in rhythm and sounds rule) opener drenches the instrument in wah-wah until the whole song swishes to and fro while has the tone of crisp clanging calypso aims for a similarly raw feel: it could appear on a trojan rs set with st hilaire sounding like a youthful bob marley elsewhere has him an octave lower and slower his dread patois laid on convincingly thick with its stacks of ghostly keyboard swirl amid palpably thick humid atmosphere also comes closest to rhythm sound only more colourful vocals tend towards the usual roots reggae fare - rootsy - with being a modern tale of employment woe and lamenting the economic inequalities of contemporary society st hilaire is convincing throughout with divine state of mind an excellent demonstration of his talents

lthough s alma mater record label sandwell district may now be defunct the actively ambiguous merican producer shows no signs of slowing down fter launching his own experimental techno label eaux earlier this year and making true-to-name appearances dressed as a sophisticated chic female has continued to pursue elusiveness while garnering an enthusiastic following amongst techno purists without a doubt the release of will further reinforce the sonic niche that the eaux label has carved out for itself nyone lucky enough to have caught a recent live set by will undoubtedly recognize the nauseating stair-climbing madness of its a horrifying panic attack of a song that manifests its unsettling effect through the use of frantically rising organ synth patterns and snappy-yet-dirty claps fter five minutes of hysteria the track seems to crumble in on itself collapsing into an echoing void its clearly the standout track of the release the b-sides stumble along at a slower pace is a warm yet skeletal track strung together with distorted synthetic backbone and adorned with squeamish alien background noises what starts as a stripped down techno track gradually blossoms into a moody strut has similarly woozy flow lethargically fading in with a slimy growl that eventually slips into resonant screams the track chugs along with bubbling atmospheres and rusting metal percussion gliding forward like a locomotive through a swamp
in the 90s took everything but girl from gloomy bedsits to clublands bright lights off the back of todd terrys remix of missing then fully embraced the dance floor with his lazy dog night and his label buzzin fly this conversion to dance music at the age of 30-something could have been interpreted as a mid-life crisis the equivalent of trading in the family hatchback for a ferrari on his new solo album we see watt picking up his acoustic guitar again but if a mid-life crisis is an attempt to relive ones youth then its actually the mature folk of rather than the deep house hes released in the last 15 years thats the textbook example returning watt to the same territory of 1983s north marine drive his last solo album but while his musical influences (robert wyatt van morrison and neil ) remain the same the distance between watt and his 21-year-old self is clear in his words which focus on memories regret and the passing of time you could say that lines like estate agents been over / ive resurfaced the driveway (on ) reveal just how middle-aged watt is but here selling a house represents the struggle to relinquish the past dave s guest appearance offers more than just star power too given that he once sang hanging on in quiet desperation / the english way on pink floyds time the very state in which exists title track a tribute to watts late sister as well as and rnolds all spin stories of lives stained with sorrow guitars and analogue synths of collaborators bernard butler and ewan pearson have the same understated beauty as the images of the english countryside that crop up throughout is an always beautiful sometimes stunning album if one that bears no trace of its creators knack for house music if the album has any relationship to club culture at all its that it could be a great a comedown staple like beth ortons central reservation which watt also produced but is more than just a soundtrack to the morning after the albums one unabashedly optimistic track invites us to sweep the curtain open / push the window wide its one of many moments that makes this seem like a bright new dawn for
a new london label is an offshoot of the crescent set up as a platform for house techno and ambient explorations its first release is from georgian producer whose radiant take on deep house first surfaced in january via german label rough rosie cross all three tracks keeps the framework sturdy and the dec r airy on the crispness of the kicks and resonant hum of the bass cut through the various layers giving a strong groove to the breezier elements is more muffled yet as percussive licks and the protruding bassline romp above the synths below it develops purpose and personality dials things back down keeping the groove dubby beneath fluttering flashes and ethereal buzz
who is that was one of the biggest questions in drum bass during since the first 12-inch from the mysterious producer(s) dropped on integral back in june now were on number three and its no clearer whos behind the name some suggest veteran producers like lomax or dj fresh while others have floated the idea that its a collective owing to the diversity the project has shown so far diversity is the theme of too weaving together smooth rollers with nastier material it rounds off a trilogy of records that made for one of last years most intriguing drum bass stories is a pitch-perfect shogun audio-style track something that might have come from spectrasouls pristine studio built around a nils frahm piano sample and a wafting floetry sample its indulging in the most romantic impulses is even smoother a slice of filter-happy sunshine that drapes a gushing overture around the rhythm track every sound drums included is contoured to go down as easily as possible and then theres an equally big shiny banger that takes things to a darker place theres something knowingly cheesy about the true detective sample but by the time the basslines are rocketing around theres no arguing with it offering up three more tracks of approachable one-size-fits-all drum bass (along with a strong digital-only bonus track ) underlines what makes such an interesting prospect

dumela 113 has its beginnings in a number of places namely chris saunders film ghost diamond the studio113 art space in johannesburg and sebenza the excellent 2012 album from lv and south african mc okmalumkoolkat these connections are all intertwined and equally important but above all they resulted in the meeting of londoner gervase gordon and south african artist fans will remember gordon from his time in lv; sebenza was his last record with them and hes now reemerged as solo producer has a more eclectic cv: she helps run studio113 toured as a dancer with die antwoord works as a model stylist choreographer the list goes on dumela 113 however is the first time shes sang on a record and her presence is vital to the eps sound theres a glossy futurism to dumela 113 from the chrome-slick drums to the hd digi-synths to s warbling expressionless autotune on and you can hear a quiet smile behind every word english or tswana and each rhythm cold and calculated as it may be feels eager to jump into a double-time gallop opens with no beats and plenty of sub-bass and when gordon drops a massive skipping rhythm under s robotic coos it calmly takes off with jumping smacking percussion is less interested in playing it cool closer is an instrumental track with no lack of flair gordon flexes a handful of synth tones over the sub-busting beat flipping from rhythmic fx to variations on a staccato melody its engaging and big enough to go down well in the right set and shows can get the job done without a vocalist that said s absence doesnt go unnoticed which only underscores how much these two belong together
porterhouse vol is the quintessential merican house mix: loud obnoxious and painfully earnest steve porter manages to cram 57 tracks into two and a half hours time making it a val u pak for thrifty dance fans wishing to get the most bang for their buck but for all its faults porterhouse vol is still a begrudgingly good time for even the snobbiest dance fan s refreshingly unpretentious for one and has the blue collar backbone of good old fashioned hard work two attributes sorely lacking in many a mix compilation porterhouse vol might just make steve the workingman s hero of the dj world n true merican tradition porter starts both discs with intros equivalent to thick slices of cheddar cheese disc one fades into the din of nydiner u s as a waitress reads off the daily specials which includes surprise surprise a delicious porterhouse steak while you re still cringing or rolling on the floor the clatter of forks and knives fades nicely into the remix of s a smooth beginning but otherwise unremarkable from there porter navigates through house s copious subgenre catacombs with mixed results: s kinshasha is a cool keyboard funker is an agreeable prog thumper while sounds about five years too late to the tribal house beach party s consolation few tracks stretch past two and a half minutes and thus never outstay their welcome until either heading into a new corner of house or getting blindsided by breaks s works great with that kind of transition but most of porter s breaks choices are blunt obvious choices with s and blackjack smelling past their expiration date meanwhile the mighty d ramirez remix of s and the dub of ement s filthy take on sukdat by soul of still sound like solid gold disc one withers out with some super commercial house tracks gs mix don t ) before flaming back up with the drinks down/hands up by the hilariously named master a track the enjoyment of which might depend on how much you ve had to drink disc two s intro opts for the ambience of a classier restaurant but with the same choice of food and fade in breaks come in a little earlier with the funky superstyle take on s percut leading into porter s that title sounds awful till you remember it in the context of the track itself: rooted in the broken beat house sound of early 0s (same time as that lamentable looney tunes tattoo trend) littered with some great era centric samples s tops among steve s own tracks on porterhouse vol a tough call since all nine of them range from above average to outstanding other artists tracks suffer in comparison actually and disc two is where porter s flow amongst them really wanes ement s arena breaks on feel woefully out of place sandwiched between handfuls of emotive house tracks porter finishes disc two on a darker more progressive tip before the big finish his own genuinely uplifting albeit extremely cheesy momento pacifico cramming nearly thirty tracks in under 80 minutes for two mixes is no small feat and porter deserves a hearty pat on the back for getting his hands dirty on porterhouse vol but with the git er dun approach he took to mixing his comp has a hard time rising above being a mere curiosity relentless 4/4 rhythm compounded by constant transitioning between tracks makes it a pretty taxing listen all the worse due to an execrable mastering job m not sure if it was because got a promo but nowhere did it say it was an unmastered press copy music notwithstanding porterhouse vol sounds truly terrible the highs are all distorted and the lows razor thin udiophiles had better shy away but undiscerning listeners might find something they like s no delicious porterhouse steak but it is a perfectly satisfying cheeseburger n french fries as far as house mixes go
mythology that surrounds the detroit duo of gerald donald and james stinson still still generates interest and speculation released in 2002 was the final album and the last chapter of their story the saga of pregnant slaves thrown overboard from ships whose children evolved to live underwater in a place called as stinson and donald went deeper into the story we found out that the africans who became ns were actually from ociya syndor a planet million light years away from course none of this would matter if hadnt been responsible for some of the best electronic music ever made and with they maintained their high standards album charts s discovery of utopia the n home universe was released amid a flurry of seven -related albums under aliases including transllusion abstract thought lab rat xl and other people place it was a non-chronological series whose entries were called storms in the storyline they took the form of supernatural forces meant to conceal the existence of three other planets in the n system from carries itself with a nervous guarded energy that makes it stand out in the duos catalogue which opens the album is certainly different from other tracks its a grungy crawl where the duos trademark twinkling arpeggios feel unbound and floaty choral vocals and synths set a sad and uncertain mood which carries into diving back into n electro with a heavy heart and a forlorn melody album was the final form of an evolution between 1998s landmark neptunes lair and harnessed storm where the groups sound palette and set of influences practically exploded tracks became sparser longer and less frantic while idm gripped the music in different ways from the springy sounds on harnessed storm to the lovelorn electronica of lifestyles laptop cafe by the time we hit the sound is transformed into something much deeper than the early submerge records you can hear that growth in a track like which is pure electro albeit with more space and finesse than before named for the people who teleported from ociya syndor to moves to a rare 4/4 kick drum pattern kissed with breezy detroit melodies its one of the few times that stinson and donald sounded more like the city they came from than the universe they created and its wonderfully smooth and mature that is an unusual record is what makes it the perfect swan song for such an enigmatic duo record is sonically rich emotionally ambiguous and loaded with some of the duos most inventive arrangements freeform style means its less consistent than past lps but its also occasionally more illuminating ends with its most traditional track a splendid piece of electro with one of the groups heaviest basslines use the star chart plot your path back to intones a reassuring voice its a reference to the duos registry of a star but it also feels like a final send off the duos way of saying goodbye

last summer dead sound and videohead dropped their first collaborative ep on chosen a gnarly little collection of broken beat techno whose accompanying artwork was fittingly a close-up shot of some machine gearing this year the mysterious duo is back with another five-track digital release a meat grinder graces the cover this time and its a good indicator of whats inside brutal rolling repetition is again on the menu but theres plenty of texture to be found if youre willing to get your hands dirty distorted vocal loops are a prominent feature and theyre used with particularly disturbing effect in the mantras of things get more and more intense until the most visceral track of the bunch which uses angular slices of sound and a few clever transitions to build up a bone-crunching maelstrom rounding out the release is a remix of from chicago artist and promoter jeff his long and lean drones are worth getting lost in and the sense of restraint is especially soothing after twenty excruciating minutes with dead sound and videohead irs is the sort of stuff thats rarely heard on todays prominent techno labels but if you like youll probably find something to love about
spinning plates the name of a new vinyl-only label is a reference to both the radiohead song and the day-jobs that pay for the project the labels first release is a four-track ep by will berridge and former drum bass producer richard meller on the pair turn out richly organic clanking techno thats different to anything either has done before and they really hit on something in the process theres an unusually satisfying interplay between the granular murk and the clearer sounds that pierce it opener signals the eps dense atmospheres its mechanical percussion and spiralling flutes emerging slowly from a soup of clicks snaps and manipulated voices the title track is the real heart of the ep its core ingredients are fairly similar to those of but it gets itself into gear far more readily with rattlesnake-like percussion and blinking piano notes snapping against taut drums the rolling mid-set techno of trusmes remix is a canny addition adding extra dj appeal to what for many might have been too subtle a package humming ambient closer meanwhile shows how versatile will held can be
i do not know how to explain this but i just realized you rarely see dance producers suddenly turning to punk while it is fairly common to see punk and rockabilly musicians becoming dance aficionados: andrew weatherall is a paragon of that trend but there s also liam howlett (in a way) moby arnaud rebotini james murphy or juan maclean to name a few you can also think now of canadian jesse f keeler previously of death from above 1979 disco-punk-fueled fame and now s own homme tout faire and house guru is the latest single from s somehow ill-received the looks album: out of context can be perceived as inconsequential filtered house but rightly sequenced like it was on cut copy s recent fabric mix it will make you feel like being thoroughly worked on by the 22-year-old a f-plaid-boxers-sporting iron-pumping six-pack-owning college-attending half-nerd half-jock northern ontario hockey player stud you know you deserve fuck the daft punk comparisons: more cher less thomas bangalter please anyway for this modular-licensed single para one is on remix duty and is offering the best boys noize impersonation you could frankly live without the real gem though comes from themselves with the exclusive b-side community revolution in progress with a dominating and (less than usual) vocoderized masculine voice exhorting you to move your hips and lick your lips to what sounds like belgian new beat (yay ) intertwined with tiga s remix of washing up (nothing wrong with that) just recorded their best track so far and is a good reason enough to never want to hear a punk chord ever again it will make you want to lick your hips move your lips and enjoy anything in between until you feel alright in the morning light

as its title might suggest contains a mighty long sample of colonel kurtz from apocalypse now marc houle would be proud shit is creepy kurtz is pitched low the techno around it is suitably tweaked enough to inspire a shiver or two isolation here though is induced by the most normal of instruments: lowly trumpet places a few of them inside each one sounding like a plane struggling to hold its altitude in the face of inclement weather and quickly losing the battle is no less unsettling but its quite a bit bouncier nonetheless shuttle once again finds himself utilizing what sound like acoustic sample sources but leaves them (again) to wither away ever-present in its second half is a tangled horn sample which putters away like hornets in front of a busy nest entrance its the main event here for the most part and at times its more than enough but at nearly 12 minutes long the same as the a-side it starts to drag by tracks end treat it as a tool and youll be fine find a way to make it the highlight of your dj set and youll either be the most boring dj alive or some sort of idiot savant

have begun life in the world of record labels with some great releases to see their way into the record boxes of many a dj releases from echofalls and u k has seen this label fully establish itself as quality motivated and they again try to deliver the goods with their latest release from and their blind dan kicks things off very smoothly as the beats slowly build their way in smooth strings ride the background with some subtle piano effects there are some subtle vocal lines that give this production a smooth deep house kind of feel and it s quite a warm way to begin the ep look at me follows on the a-side and is quite chunkier then blind dan vocals play a greater role as they ride the smooth beats and intricate clatters of the drums the baseline subtly rides its way in the background providing a smooth flow to the production smooth piano lines and strings also give this production a very lovely feel delightful stuff with look at me happy shopper ups the pace on the flip and also introduces a smooth techy feel to the ep with a nice synth pattern that weaves itself with some vocal effects and smooth pads that ride the background of the track the track gets a little on the funky side deep in with some bubbly effects but all in all maintains a great groove throughout gangbusterz concludes things with a percussive focus the drums are the main focus here as they keep the track chugging along complimented well with smooth effects and subtle strings it s a pretty good state of affairs at cuba with this release a good combination of tracks by (who has delivered some astonishing stuff especially under his disposable heroes guise on sub rossa records) and a release that should appeal to those that may not be familiar with cuba
well that didnt take long: s starts out with what sounds a needle dropped a little too far ahead into an already happening track and it doesnt let up from there it has a crisply articulated house vibe to it with some nicely swung hi-hats and a snare clack to snap everything to attention theres also a dreaminess that manages a little paradoxically to make everything tighter and more forceful the effect pays off a bit more in dor which sounds more old school in a sort chicago-meets-manchester way without coming off as a paean to the past there are something like seven or eight little hooky parts just dripping out of dor at any given point so much so that seven minutes feels a little too short in the end those with a yen to hear franck remixes wont go wanting here as he puts in not one but three mixes of his version is spritzy and leaned back while his dub takes much the same mix and simply softens it up the dub is where its at though a bleary-eyed heavy-lidded affair that zips up and zones out as it goes on and on
the may be cloaked in secrecy (press materials indicate its a duo whose members have previously achieved some degree of solo success for whatever thats worth) but their musical affiliations arent nearly as mysterious like plenty of others over the last decade who have dedicated themselves to disco theyve kept the music alive by resurrecting the very hooks that soundtracked the dance floors of yore albeit with a good deal of their own editing and knob-twisting like runaway tdrmc amplifies the most epic strains of 70s dance music stretching out gummy tempos and shimmering strings into modern club tracks that could seemingly last all night the title of their latest ep then is a bit of a misnomer: the nuts and bolts of the four songs ep are likely snipped from songs but the end results are unquestionably floor-oriented opener dont departs from the old more fully than the rest of the ep the crisp drums and persistent bass buzz are strikingly contemporary but the reverb-laden vocal serves as a reminder of where this sound came from on the other hand is more intact with a diva sample and monster piano bouncing over a heavy shuffle at nearly 11 minutes the stately is both the longest and most laidback inclusion by we can hear house music beginning to take shape amidst the shimmering strings and sassy bass a subtle hint that tdrmc have more at work in their music than salsoul sides alone
s spacey -sides have been getting love from steve bug and the poker flat family since the turn of the century but despite his reputation for putting together sophisticated and dance floor friendly house there have been a few questionable releases over the years werkschau thankfully is not one of them gets underway with a punchy kick coupled with a stuttering hi-hat and snare which are eventually joined by melodious synth and basslines together they tick along nicely before being joined by an oscillating third layer fter a brief break in the percussion things really pick up seeing landsky embark on another multi-layered synth excursion with even more attention paid to the bass and drum dynamics on the flip stays relatively subdued adding an eastern-tinged electronic layer to a deep bass groove and sporadic vocal the result will most likely be reserved for post-9:00 m sets rounding out the package returns to peak-time territory serving as the eps most instrumentally stripped back track ll the attention is on the snappy drums as they entwine with a chanting and echoing vocal giving djs yet another healthy tool for their landsky arsenal
is the second outing for harri and the revenges fife-referencing moniker but the assured touch of linger longer betrays a studio partnership that stretches back a decade aside from the comparatively solemn which is gilded with disco guitar licks a soaring moog synth and military-parade snares linger longer is irresistibly fun as with is co-produced by blinding bill docherty and esa williams and the latters influence is overt in the tracks percussive swagger its gently heated arp notes and medley of bongos marimba and woodblocks are well suited to the leisurely pace that harri and the revenge prefer this makes the frantic gallop of all the more surprising williams only appears on the a-side but his quirky influence seems to be here as well: cute car horn stabs and chopped gospel vocals ride along to a single bass note that flexes and flops into shape feels a little less inspired and it may have been a better choice for the bonus track than the revenges superior remix of
theres always been something provocative about anstams music it combines unlikely genres into bombastic hybrids favouring excess and the bizarre over tasteful restraint so this new ep for under his younger alias is a surprise it lacks the proggy extravagance and madcap left turns you might expect instead its three tracks build on one of the producers very chillest cuts last years sensing social sirens on all city to explore a kind of pensive techno stable of groove and shot through with delicate melody ok there are hints of the producers urge to disrupt on its the cheeky melody that punctures the pastoral mood partway through and on its the sharp synthetic teeth on the bassline and those clumsy plumes of reverb puffing out behind it these moments jar slightly at first but they also give the tracks a distinctive charge its a combination of the soothing and the unsettling familiar from classic idm the closing track makes the influence explicit over a gorgeous kick-and-click beat brassy chords pull gently but firmly on the heartstrings not very anstam but not bad either
it can be done but only i can do it would have made a fine alternate t le for syro richard d jamess mind-melting hyper-distinctive return as from last year thank you for letting me be myself another omar-s album t le works well for jamess latest the few artists could claim creative carte blanche on the level james can especially after an album t showed hes still in his prime long after his first run of classics and here he claims the hell out of turning in a moody set t sounds a b like e her tom wa s instrumentals a gamelan ensemble going pop or maybe just some b s from syro played back at a fraction of their original speed where syro played up jamess virtuos y as an arranger composer and programmer acoustic instruments emphasizes atmosphere a crucial component of selected ambient works 85-92 of particular interest is w happens when acoustic instruments are played in a room the reverb tails the quirky resonances and the telling hiss of the machine t s capturing them the textures are certainly sumptuous and occasionally they lend the record something unique t s the case on which sets a syro -style madcap arrangement to a tense shuffle we hear every instruments creak and crunch but no matter how many notes and drum h s james throws at us the track still grooves s s at the oppos e end of the spectrum focusing on squeezing as many tones from as many bang-able surfaces as possible james spends most of the ep in t exploratory mode and though theres a certain pleasure in listening to an artist figure things out a full 28 minutes feels like overkill regardless s comforting to know james isnt settling into a routine

david letelliers music used to remind me of those production demos youd hear on home theatre rigs around the turn of the century disarmingly clear and robust sounds made to show off the systems they were made for his 2011 album or was the pinnacle of this feeling with 11 tracks of sculpted metal that took on repetitive but rarely intuitive structures letelliers spent the years since then hammering that sound into more techno-friendly shapes last years solens arc lp added a sense of narrative framing itself around several movements that formed something of an abstract saga arriving just a year later has an even stronger narrative and is also more emotive and off-the-cuff than letelliers other full-lengths follows the story of its titular character the one depicted in the albums strange artwork who found her comfort zone in a constant state of crisis the sleevenotes fill in the blanks with a jumble of high-concept jargon and social commentary with the odd bit offering insight into the albums concept: endless social media scrolling ; slow drift towards the outer limits of society ; the occasional blasts of kitchen appliances ; embracing the mayhem contemplating the crumbling of a system is the story of someone struggling to break through the suffocating din of technology communication and capitalism it shows human nature or at least human turmoil fogging the immaculate surfaces of letelliers music which were once so reflective they seemed to reject feeling altogether the album is structured like a film rising to a climax and coming back down again it starts with hi-tech broken beat on and the pacemaker palpitations of before arriving at the more confrontational the action scenes hit early on with a gauntlet of dissociative sounds and textures it represents both an impressive expansion of letelliers sound palette (there are wood and rubber textures here) and the records climate of sensory overload with noises coming at the listener from all angles and reach the boiling point embodying the personal crisis at the center of the album theres a striking moment in the tale accompanying that points to why the album is so powerful: the sound of the city mixed with the music on her headphones would weave complex rhythms and futuristic textures into a beautifully coloured pixellated surface thats a feeling that should be familiar to most modern music listeners its the sound of your own music mingling with the sounds of life going on around you that idea powers a record where letelliers music graduates from self-contained sound design to something contemplative of and occasionally angry at the world around it

is a funny one he doesn t have much faith in techno ( techno can be the most boring and hateable music because it is so stupid and it is always the same ) but every now and then he puts out a techno track that is better than almost anything out there perhaps koze s boredom with the format is his best asset: it s not hard to imagine him cackling away in the studio as he inserts his trademark surprises into tracks to screw with us (this is a man who travels the world with a cd of pre-recorded synth noise to insert into sets at will) his most successful surprise yet is surely that bit when the bass arrives in rutalga square : the track is techno music but it s really all about making the soundsystem suddenly quadruple in size halfway through next best is the unjustly overlooked (hard to mix ) don t feed the cat from his album koze comes round which switches gears at the end and turns into - surprise - strobelit mentalism with its tongue hanging out now with ll the koze has done it again but this time the surprise is all about the scissors track itself is very it s a bit deep house even but what makes it great are the little slivers koze snips out of it here and there: for the tiniest instant clubbers are going to be startled by dead silence its a much more humble cut than rutalga square or don t feed the cat and it s only five minutes long but those little snips make it distinct enough to be essential on the -side is more of a cocktail sipper: downtempo but with ample space given to ig studio whirrings and purrings to get you in the mood lazy sunday afternoon stuff overall this is sick
are a melbourne based trio who specialise in making organic dance music made possible by chris corby an accomplished guitarist whos also worked as a protools engineer on albums by the avalanches and you am i to name a few and also fran power who is a classically trained violinist rounding out the trio is shirley davis who provides the group with her smooth vocal stylings the first two tunes on the ep are straight up diva led vocal house numbers been good is the first single released from the ep and features shirleys vocodered and filtered vocals a deep plodding disco style bassline distorted rock guitar stabs and deep electro disco effects want to love you is a more uplifting number featuring a funky piano riff and retro disco effects diamond takes the mood and energy down a notch to downtempo beats featuring out of this world sci-fi effects and spacey synths beautiful thing gives the ep a much harder edge incorporating gritty rock guitars tough hip hop beats and features a collaboration with deep brother to lays down some deep vocals in the vein of massive attack and tricky seraph is the first of two instrumental cuts on the album which utilises a familiar old skool funk/uptempo hip hop break dropping a few rewinds in for good measure another jazzy piano lick is combined with scratches and cinematic string arrangements and finally the ep comes to a close with smarvellous on a downbeat hip hop tip dropping atmospheric synth lines drumnbass style drum fills to bring the cd to a comfy laidback ending overall not bad but not great the tunes although original pieces of work feel like theyve been done by other artists and in some cases done years ago as well
note to my new followers: i dont make play or listen to dubstep no drama just clearing things up wrote on his twitter feed recently whatever the reason for his personal rebranding its true that the music has been releasing recently sounds nothing like his early productions (as trg) for subway hessle tempa and immerse (the note is doubly funny because this is the same artist who back when he was still making something more like dubstep called one of his tracks your friends like techno ) these days the romanian producer is making house music for lack of a better word builds a nest out of dusty drum-machine hits and multiple layers of processed samples which sketch out the tonal outline; its loose thumping groove signals its rejection of a purist four-to-the-floor stomp at the tail end of every four bars when the kick drum stubbornly stumbles s the tune builds fluttering chords and a detuned acid line fill out the spaces in between dry beats like a skeleton oozing something viscous on of ttraction s particular approach to vocals again carries the day as he smears a single indistinct phrase into a slowly enveloping wave thats mirrored in massing augmented chords theres no shortage of artists in either house or dubstep who attempt similar tricks with voices but is the only one who seems to have discovered todd edwards while scuba diving sturdy kick/hi-hat combination gives the groove its urgent tech-house clip but shakers and hand percussion cut crosswise with thrumming nervous energy its only when it ends that you really recognize the skipping vinyl rhythm thats been underneath the whole time a lock groove blown out to massive proportions that underscores the sense that the whole thing could fall apart at any time
dam x perc is a techno collaboration heavy enough to make a crater for decades dam x has been holding down industrial techno with a new york perspective (though he now resides in berlin) while perc is the face of a new generation of uk producers who evoke the countrys grey skies and brutalist architecture isnt the first time theyve convened it follows a workmanlike self-titled ep from 2013 the duo return with a vengeance for this one highlighting some of the more exaggerated aspects of their like-minded approaches the most striking part of is the vocal ( into the battle / we dont follow your rules of engagement ) hissed like a tense moment from a vintage ministry track the duo give it an industrial backing: kicks slam and wobble forcefully and the chords are almost orchestral its almost overblown but sounds like the duo enjoying themselves playfulness from artists responsible for some of the more dour dance music out there is more conventional but theres something viscerally satisfying about how the chords grind against distorted drums like a saw cutting through metal it doesnt have the cheeky edge of but its still rock solid collaborations like these are bound to set high standards but with their second go at it dam x perc are nearly there
for his new label swing is eschewing dj promotion and extensive a r ops in favor of releasing (mainly) his own club bullets like the rest of this ep has a bedrock of thick chewy bass to that henning adds a yawning low-end synth and an indecipherable repetitive vocal sample same heavy propulsive kick also opens up theyre so similar that at first you may confuse it as a section of the opener what sets it apart is an elastic bass which uncoils then snaps back arriving on the scene locks into a simple steam-driven groove early on and stays there as a result it lacks some of the nuance of the rest of the ep appropriately enough echoes with creepy john carpenter-style synths and threatening strings it rounds off an ep of unadorned but incendiary dance floor weapons
aka william bensussen is a peculiar entity on the one hand hes an artist who refuses to be bound by convention or accepted practice on the other hes an obsessive perfectionist while the l a beat scene within which he operates has been around for several years now its musical parameters have not been completely set theres no time signature to work within no rules regarding melody and harmony and definitely no constraints when it comes to rhythm kicks the ep off and is testament to that its downtempo and unlike the rest of the package doesnt purport to have been built around dusty analogue sampling im follows calling up san diego-based vocalist to sing out-of-tune lyrics over a kick-less excursion into psychedelic rock with bensussen blending digital bass with vintage strings which results in an eerie three-minute loop its with the arrival of that bensussens skills behind the boards really shine the drums are programmed to perfection but daring at the same time unlike other members of the clique lorn daedelus and even flying lotus for example bensussen frequently departs from the conventions of melody sometimes it seems he just wants you to bang your head the rhythms crafted from sampled breaks on are excellent theyre looped looped and looped again and while some would call that lazy in the hands of bensussen theyre superb as every few bars brings a slight shift in the snare arrangement shatering ner and monsterfromtheundergound close out the release on the former fellow l a resident provides guest synths over a shifting snare and hi-hat loop the latter is the eps shortest and most relentless making use of a distorted midrange and up-tempo pace closing out a solid and adventurous release
vinyl-only label run by yanneck salvo ( k ) and hauke freer (half of session victim) has been silent since the treats vol 5 compilation from last spring and himself hasnt released anything in about as long its a pleasure to have both back on the four-track which alights on shades of ambient jazzy house and broken beat with equal skill brief opener is billed as the follow-up to enter salvos contribution to that fifth treats it inverts the tracks sparky keys into something drifting and thoughtful but is more of a year-late coda than a standalone track in its own right doesnt let its rhodes-flecked jazz touches get in the way of club-readiness with a sleek vocal loop and restless percussive shuffle adding both texture and momentum on the flip burnin basks in a diva-ish vocal but doesnt rely on it entirely urgent percussion and siren-like keys chip in to enliven it all takes us back to the lounge its broken-beat spine swaddled in glowing piano notes and a deliciously limber bass groove
you have to be pretty confident to call your release underground nthems if the music is in any way likely to be accused of being cheesy or boring you re going to look pretty stupid fortunately these guys don t need to worry too much particularly as volume 1 was no lie a bit of an underground hit last year s epic strings driven in the is the emotive trancey one on this release taking a bit of the same role as k soul and ra h s turning point on volume one it s lush and inflected with more than a touch of classical music refore making it er rather classy who provided the most muscular and sexual track on volume one is a bit more laid back here has a slightly juan tkins feel to it with almost electro y beats under calm and soothing strings re s a bit of a sting in the tail of this track though as it peaks at the same time that it ends with new melodies and a touch of acid lifting the energy levels finally (who owns sistrum so it s kind of weird that this release is on ) rounds out the ep with of this is the housiest track of the three with a distinctive one note bassline and almost garage y beats twisty melancholic melodies however are pure techno re are three solid tracks here perhaps nothing as immediate as deep for on volume one but definitely a lot to chew over musically with in the probably being the most arresting of the three ultimately it s definitely underground and while it might miss out on anthems status this is still the kind of ep that could get played all year due to the quality and variety of the tracks
links up with for his first full release (under his best-known alias at least) since excellent flowers of destruction lp from 2013 is a step away from berlin stalwarts usual style deep tech-y drum bass toward more subdued sounds still it brims with dystopian moods that should be familiar to fans stretches across 17 minutes as fully indulges his ambient tendencies very slowly emerging from silence its a foggy introspective affair laced with reverb-drenched field recordings and long uneasy stirrings as it moves through different spaces there are a few crucial bits rhythm: a doleful arpeggio at first pulsing low-end triplets later and finally a single s t click the b-side creeps into techno mode with 65-bpm vignette understated 3/4 drums and drawn-out basslines carry it while dubwise vocals and a few lonely synth figures float into mix the tempo doubles on onar s remix this one reminds me regis in particular his own track blood witness might onar be ano r alias ei r way its a deep fiery cut broken-beat techno which finishes this adventurous ep on a confrontational note
there s a new label in town this time from the bright lights and glitz of tokyo called their first release comes from an american duo by the name of with their they are charged with the task of making the first release of one to remember not an easy task for any artist kicking off a label with their release first up is the title track bring it to me and it s a massive techno track with a big funky edge disco vibes meet a truly devastating baseline as well as some driving beats and filtered effects it s quite simply a track you can t ignore and a production that is sure to work some magic on the floors first up on the b-side is sexy circuit and the baselines keep on rolling chugging beats combine with quirky vocal snippets all while the baseline pounds away in the background keeping the track moving at all times throughout solid dancefloor material next up on the b-side is pressure the toughest track of the lot the production features some intense percussive elements as well as some tough chunky low end sounds all in all though this is some dark driving techno and definitely not for the feint hearted a definite success for the first release for and one that could really help this label get off to a promising start
mapping has come a long way in the past decade so much so that we can almost touch the rough edges of the coast nowadays simply by pressing a button wirelessly s takes us on a drifting aural travelogue that me ers from pinpoint locations into banal stretches that hint of human existence faded memories these subtle tracks are like translucent sketches where the depth of field is tripped stretched rather gently by the expanse of fine tonal values fischers strings pings on the title track reverb in a n glow at midday dont look away from the stream of deadpan light ahead if were to imply a topographical line it has succeeded in being anything but straight ahead one of the more captivating qualities of this record is that there is a sense of distance of anonymity its as though fischer is watching waiting ready to pounce in dynamic tension but instead takes a big breath exhales into a new passage perhaps the result is a form of ritualized circular breathing like that of a conditioned jazz brassman going full tilt the softly undulating gestures are like a l mass meeting the recessing sea this is especially pronounced on the sumptuous to it is the tease of the waves that draws the ear in its fairly subliminal yet the field recordings blend with the processing like fog lifts from the glassy surface of water at high tide lethargic passages lead into restrained moments made from electric hiss whispers of percussion almost like wind moving through an empty room you can loosely picture a simple backyard an old gated fence clothesline the ghosts of those playing mere yards away but rather than pure melancholic nostalgia brings a bit of poker-faced earthliness to a genre often too abstract or clinical is one of those classic ambient tracks that draws you in with its patient phrasing tiny goings-on still there remains this lingering hesitance throughout a somewhat converging skeptical dialectic emerges as if fischer is both questioning observing nature simultaneously
*back catalog review* deliver 2 silky smooth productions with the 4th release on hallucination limted silkymama is on the a-side and it begins with a nice deep house groove and some very warm vibes it builds early on with a nice deep baseline that essentially gives the production its groove a nice piano line features midway in as do some bubbly effects and the baseline takes another twist deep into the production giving it a real funky edge a great production this on the flip is the very elegant luna maduro much more downtempo then silkymama this track makes good use of atmospheric effects as well as a latin style drum arrangement it features some nice retro melodies throughout and a nice deep baseline deep into the production a nice unique addition to this release
you know the story: year is 1976 rian eno hasnt yet collaborated with owie on low and is looking for a project eno had already shown huge krautrock interest with roxy music and (possibly apocryphal) quotes from the era have him calling harmonia the worlds most important rock band at the time what is clear: he loved the band a group composed of musicians from neu and cluster nd so as the leaves in forst germany turned from green to gold eno and the boys lay down what would become tracks traces nd then it was forgotten not to be heard from until 1997 when the original masters were discovered in a climate-controlled space capsule hovering over erlin (ok i made that part up ) either way they were released by rykodisc more than a decade ago nd rereleased this year on gr nland records nd the results if you dont already have them in your amniotic playlist are pretty much as to be expected wistful chuggy fun sad corny shimmering eschatological and above all pregnant with the sounds would set detroit and manchester afire in just a few short years durutti column fans this is the nag hammadi codex real reason were here today though is to discuss the pair of remixes available on chic white vinyl and digital from reimaginings come from some top talent from the brainier side of todays techno shackleton on the and ppleblim with on the shackleton picks the chilly aquifer that is in utumn and warms it up just a click adding a cavernous beat pattern and picking snips of the tunes wandering pads to loop to the point of near annoyance he truncates the track from 15 minutes down to ten and the result seems much longer than the original its a bit like stealing the stones from a ruined temple of antiquity to build a public restroom ppleblim and pick a much riper fruit to mess with and do so much more likeably beatless original y the a bouncy amoeba of space bass and air compressor synths trades primarily in charm and whimsy rework adds a satisfying thunk-to-the-gut kick some skitter snares and some choice parts of the source to add some structure but for the most part leaves the artifact fully intact if only restored and repainted for modern audiences it also weighs in at a slim 7 minutes 49 seconds nearly two minutes shorter than the original which if one is trading evolving shades for conventional techno structure is a smart boredom-fighting move remix will always be a remix and idea about an idea ut for material that never got the attention it deserved in the era for which it was made it can be a necessary freshening to keep fine music where it belongs out of the museum and in your ears
mark their first release by using the extensive talents of they deliver two moody productions to begin life for the new label particle porthole is first up and the track has a very smooth and moody beginning with some great effects sprinkled over a nice set of beats soon enough though the track takes off with a deep chunky baseline that gives the track an immense drive and from here on the production forms into a nice deep progressive cut dubinisms follows in the same vein with some very smooth effects creating the way for a nice deep baseline to take control and take the track in a very good direction the building of melodies and effects helps creat a good structure to the production if you have heard dso work before then you should know the quality to expect great depth to the track helped with deep b-lines and some great effects and sounds
jordan czamanski whos part of juju jordash and magic mountain high is a major proponent of live often improvised techno s hes channeled those jammy impulses into jazzier music sounds that are more soulful than spacey each record has been better than the last culminating in the classy lushlyfe on rush hour last year czamanski returns to his label with his most ambitious solo effort taking past work into new cinematic realms is the aural equivalent of putting chemicals in a beaker and watching them bubble for 16 minutes its all about texture: gurgling synths spurt their way through a heady intro before a kick drum brings some order around five minutes in then the keyboards fade into view with chords daubing together and shimmering in a wonderfully lazy melody is some of czamanskis prettiest playing on record s the track recedes into a smouldering outro it cuts a soft-focus shape somewhere between fred p and mood hut two alternate mixes offer beatless and techno-fied versions theyre presumably for dance floor use but this record is really all about the -sides careful sprawl on czamanskis improvisation feels almost symphonic
the arrangement basic thrust and edge of melancholic reserve not exactly missing from a lot of more recent tracks but beside the point of a good amount of them make s sound like it could have been from a few years earlier yet theres a luminousness to the track a highlight of triangulation that marks it as definitively its partly because the tracks gleam is heavily marked by the techno crosses over with so easily but released as a single its more like a welcome pause for breath as dubstep hurtles forward it also provides a nice through-line for the -side fter all why stop at crossing over with techno when you can also have us that labels head will and collaborator deliver a remix of the track preceding on triangulation the original does the chase-scene smoky-doomy thing with a nice assurance and change the scenery sideline the menacing synths by making them bubble more and straighten up the beat retaining enough off-kilter percussion to connect it to its parent version while retaining the tricked-up house feel youd expect
re are just so many ways one can enjoy music you can for example enjoy the sound you can enjoy the colour of the sound: you can taste it feel it and see it electronic sounds may take you far away - to the future or perhaps to space guitars may take you home another layer would be enjoying the vitality of music: music lets us connect it stimulates us to feel peoples passion for life to feel their creativity and strength translated into playing instruments into movement furthermore the human mind has something similar to the anti-shock mechanism you see in portable music players - the mechanism which remembers the next couple of minutes of the song in advance human mind doesnt skip of course but it enables us to enjoy the music as a whole intelligent piece you can enjoy your memory of it the previous couple of seconds and the seconds about to arrive thats why i guess mash-ups and remixes sometimes work so well vocals remind us of the original song and then we make most of the music up in our imagination take for example villalobos remix of depeche modes sinner in me: it s an extremely delicate minimal work built mainly around puny signs that we automatically associate with the original put to use an amazing number of those options andy meecham has been around for a while as a part of electro-bass outfit chicken lips putting out italo-disco records as sir drew and now comes his full second lp as tem vertical tones arrives after a long series of twelve-inches (apparently released to conserve real-time dynamics and please the vinyl worshippers) taking a swift turn to whats fashionably designated today as kosmische aka what daniele baldelli et al would call cosmic disco it s a style that s revitalizing great cuts from the seventies possibly in reaction to minimal technos mathematical saturninity minimal might be great for the berlin school its strict form taking melody and rhythm one step forwards or backwards (depends on your perspective) does the opposite: the melody is all over the place and the instrumentation is live in an almost sneeringly blatant manner multilayered as its name vertical tones horizontal ise coats electronic pulses vertically while congas cowbells and other rhythm instruments gush horizontally it s a fun record that would be fierce enough for the psych-punk-funk crowd and it s a true demonstration of the capabilities of the london-based label home of padded cell and other chicken lips members and acquaintances influences are clear: anything analogue anything counter-technological meecham tries to give this record - to paraphrase a great poet a borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered seventies and he succeeds: sound is warm and vinyl krautrock and no-wave live in harmony here more evidence that this is a reaction to the often somber minimal sound lets go back lets not go digital but lets stay relevant most of the cuts are excellent from the western movie stylings of to the clever palindromic beauty of although at times tracks lose some solidity perhaps the result of meecham listening to too many different muses all in all if you were looking for another electrohouse stomper that would make you dance and sweat but feel a bit lonely afterwards dont look over here if you loved rephlexs reissue of black devil youre a sucker for vintage sounds and even in 00 you still understand how music should be listened to you have just found what you were looking for all this time

absolutely guaranteed not to appeal to moody techno fucks is the standout line from the press release for s latest two-tracker but its difficult to imagine anyone resisting the joyous disco charms of s title track is christoph daze dasen aka plastique de reve and sami liuski aka bangkok impact/putsch 79 this is their second release on the glasgow label and like last summers self-titled debut ep it uses top-drawer sampling and production skills to produce something that feels like modern disco rather than nu-disco title track is the big news here its charisma immediately evident in its warm glimmer of keys and background chatter its an irresistible ten-minute ride starring a female disco vocal ( i dont know how much of this i can take/ now my body is beginning to ache/ my resistance is beginning to fade/ be the music ) and a dramatic cascade of classic disco flourishes res also a killer mid-track breakdown that breathes yet more life into its final few minutes with the disco box ticked dasen and liuski head in a different direction on heavens linking up a spoken vocal about evacuating planet earth with spacey pads keys and atmospheric touches this slow-mo cosmic house number cant help but be overshadowed by the a-side but in this case theres no shame in that

either is one of those annoying co workers who genuinely enjoys the company of his boss or as is more likely knows hes never too accomplished to stop listening to industry big dogs such as ibadan top man who shows on this team up that hes still more than capable of giving younger artists a little push in the right direction is one of the best house cuts of late summer a skipping almost 2 step drum loop is enveloped in warm big room pads that build throughout underlined by vocals that sneak in and take charge halfway through it strikes a perfect balance between deep sun drenched day listening and late night room filler its a shame it comes a little too late in the season to gain summer anthem status but maybe thats a good thing as we know how quickly tracks given such a title can become tired brings his trademark new york kick and snare to (pt as the duo combine dark dramatic strings with jangling piano licks that keep the track moving forward on the second part the drums are given more room to breathe bongo and snappy snare hits roll in over the top adding a chunkier feel to a more driven carnival inspired track debuting on s contribution to the d edge series in june is a collaboration with ibadan labelmate the us based brings some san fran attitude to the track as tough talking upfront vocal snippets bounce off a robust drumbeat knee jerk industrial stabs present the tracks intention to get right up in your face while tugging aggressively at your hips its the grittiest tip on quite an upbeat ep

its hard to believe that is s debut release for like that labels output boris bunniks work typifies an open-ended approach to music-making which integrates techniques from the first wave of dutch techno producers mixed with other influences while steve rachmads strings are audible so too are the lopsided rhythms of stefan robbers and the analogue touches of shiver along with the ice sculpted ambience and the seductive electronic groove of hollands west coast italo new school the title track features a growling menacing bass but rather than bludgeoning the listener into submission with a straight dance floor arrangement bunnik opts for a circuitous route that journeys through the melodic peaks and troughs that sterac once ventured to with the heavenly asphyx follows a totally different path with trippy effects and larger-than-life hooks heralding bunniks diversification into spine-shivering irresistible electronic disco rhythms on the other hand is a serene beatless affair its pristine synth lines reminiscent of pre- ginger speedy j wildly diverse yet united by bunniks seemingly contradictory raw but polished approach to production has the quality its title suggests in spades
one of the most rewarding aspects of s recent the power the glory was its diversity: if anybody had feared that industrial techno was headed for a gurning dead end here was evidence to the contrary its fitting then that the producer has enlisted a diverse and colourful cast of british techno operators to remix the record tessela is first up returning to trax for the first time since remixing his brother truss back in 2010 his rework of album highlight riffs on the playful breakbeat-techno style hes been honing of late s with parts of the nancys pantry ep the effect is rather like shed (who used a similarly clattering 2-step beat in his remix of ellipsis ) but squalls of interference from the original not to mention dan chandlers unmistakable shrieks lend it a pleasingly chaotic edge untold tackles replacing the originals oppression with a kind of scurrying urgency reminiscent of powell or containers basement workouts as much as his own recent black light spiral the bass sound is a handy taster of what your speakers will do moments before they die its a godawful racket that pretty much hamstrings the groove but that was almost certainly the intention finally clouds version of is brooding slow-mo techno with all manner of unexpected twists its probably the most intriguing thing theyve ever done; clearly s music brings out the best in people
eamon harkin and justin carter the guys behind talk a lot about community they see their intimate events in rooklyn as a place for interesting and open-minded people to come together and they greatly value the results of these connections which range from new friendships to newborn babies (as they explain in their ra exchange ) somewhere in the middle of this is the music on their label all of which (with the exception of their next 12-inch from dark sky) has come from young artists who hang out at their parties: first anthony naples then archie pelago and now urkat supposedly sent harkin and carter the title track from one morning after he got home from the song definitely lends itself to that kind of moment: driven by cinematic strings and a marching rhythm it has the momentous feeling of an epiphany ( arcade fire house as one ra staffer dubbed it) harkin and carter remix the track trimming it down into something more refined and understated oth versions are excellent and more than make up for a party tune that ends up sounding bland by comparison
if you arent familiar with czech-born rlin-based producer from her own bass-heavy broodings on you might be familiar with her role as the disembodied voice in tommy four sevens primate or as the one who provided the field recordings for ostgut tons funf compilation with a winding musical history that stretches from the dubstep caverns of bristol to the rghain the sound shes let trickle out on a steady series of singles is a parched take on dubstep equally influenced by trip-hop and techno the hardcore continuum running through its ice cold veins in all its extant forms you probably could have guessed that works as a sound designer even if i hadnt told you; her music is painstakingly well designed the kind of thing you could expect to soundtrack an installation as much as a club night as a result of this approach s songs tend to feel like empty shells rather than proper structures aside from a few notable exceptions like the thundering dubstep of she doesnt approach them as songs so much as discrete spaces for sound to inhabit and reverberate above all s music is formidably physical a quality only amplified by the tense silence that constantly threatens to swallow everything around it listen on headphones and youll get an uncomfortably absent 48 minutes; listen on a good system and youll be entrapped and immersed effect is a record that feels like it lives in a vacuum of permanent blackness a gothic sensibility that extends itself to the albums baroque instrumental flourishes ( the ) as inhospitable as it might feel sometimes is a very identity-intense album thats her face on the cover thats her name as the title and her distinct vocals and gasps are all over it gasp is the key word: a strained choke somewhere between nico and th gibbons uses her voice as elements to drive tracks repeating simple melodies like mantras ( ) or layering her voice to wonderfully creepy effect ( ) when she goes for the full-vocal effect like on the industrial-tinged opener its less successful her apathetic vocals failing to convey either the anxious sensuality or anger necessary to pull off the songs s m themes but those moments are rare and more often than not her vocals layer like frazzled brushstrokes over intense behemoths of vibration ( ) rarely goes the easy route: you wont find many complete melodies here or many sounds that dont flit and disappear immediately after rattling the cage it really does feel more like a piece of sound art than dance music but then again im sure the demented basslines of or the action-movie chords of could a rock a club just fine

a thrilling derby football match the new 12 from funk dvoid and phil kieran is a game of two halves with two tracks of opposing strategies going head to head the elfast/glasgow collab keeps on truckin with the fourth instalment of their dancefloor friendly series which has thus far managed a hundred percent strike rate every release has found its way into the boxes of the big room jocks get a sense that fdv had more of an input on thin snare barely keeps the lid on a deep 303 bassline and swells of soft eno-esque synths this track builds and simultaneously disorientates running down cul-de-sacs before finding its way out it borders ever so close to cheese but pick your moment carefully and its saccharine tone will surely have loved-uppers beaming from ear to ear the complete antithesis to all this tear-inducing harmony is the booty-shaker lack as sounding like a carbon copy of lack worm minus the big bleep its gritty intervals of squiggled and jagged noise samples makes it feel much more like a phil kieran track than the -side unashamedly blunt and heavy this one could well land itself in court for a bit of grevious bodily harm and will no doubt be an effective set tool as we approach the summer double-pronged outing that combines sweet and sour or a bit of sauciness with a grilled tech house platter for a main course
at the risk of sounding hyperbolic im just going to come out and say it: no one in techno surpasses when it comes to sound design credit kyma lsd or simply his own brain and the ears that bookend it most probably a combination of all three but the barcelona-based musician seems to have the keys to a secret world of circuitry thats certainly the impression you get listening to his new ep for which features two cuts from his new album inertials along with two unreleased tracks in terms of form and structure the music isnt so far out there: slots neatly into the basic channel tradition; recalls on the surface the dubsteppier excursions of shed or monolake inhabits its dub techno skin with ease while faintly recalls oni ayhuns off-kilter arpeggiations but if you cant hear past the level of structure youre missing the whole point of the release ashen chords of might sound familiar from scads of dusky techno releases but the timbres vogel achieves not to mention the yawning sense of space are miles beyond the work of his contemporaries his palette is unusually dynamic and unusually interconnected: its difficult to tell where a given sound begins and ends instead scrapes and plucks and thumps and twangs fuse into something at once hard and hazy a rippling continuum perpetually reassembling itself in mid-air
is a vintage ambient project from the dutch artist frans de waard de waard has been experimenting with sound for over 0 years and his discography is intimidating in size there are plenty of limited edition vinyl runs cassettes and live recordings for labels most of us have never heard of de waard also runs a few labels himself he calls a failed attempt at ambient house which was popular in the uk when he started making it he used sparse rhythms created from sampled loops which were paired with dense synths and field recordings the first new material in about two decades sounds remarkably different on the a-side begins with a sprawling sonic projection of the seaside with squawking gulls and synths lapping at the shore the lapping intensifies and transforms into a beat as the water subsides giving way to one of the clearest rhythms de waard has released as prepare to be dancing by the time it gets fully underway is effervescent techno and good clean fun but lacks the depth of previous material the shorter and weirder is closer to the projects original ambient vibe
it seems poignant or desperate to cling to the arch symbol of glitch in a moment of rebirth but thats exactly hat marcus gabler has done ith his resurrection of by releasing clicks cuts 5 0 paradigm shift the first three volumes of the celebrated series arrived at a moment hen glitch hen digitalism and information had usurped their controllers and delivered the promise of ne forms times have changed: paradigm shift as its title implies breaks the mould of previous editions mp founder chim szepanski is no longer involved ith the label nd instead of pursuing a discrete idea this compilation acts more like a direct commercial interface ith the imprint s is a frigid and bristling data orkout that leads straight to his album hereas the inclusion of the video edit of metsubs post rock sounding says it all but its the trimming of most tracks to near four minutes to either fit more in or sucker you in to chasing do n the full length that leaves the ugliest taste t orst it trivialises past and present by commercialising it t best it doesnt suggest much confidence in the music paradigm shift is not an outright failure musically the phasing melodies that close metsubs aforementioned track entice hereas the lo end beat ambience of both and oki s tracks as ell as marro s e coli ith its sakamoto/ lva noto esque tones are thro backs but orthy of the name some experimental tracks like s forceful maelstrom and s abrasive dreamscape sound as if theyre pushing things for ard others like the rephlex esque idm of both and lodsb or s scatter sample collage all seem cleverly made but are uninspiring several tracks have their moments but stagnate too easily n at four minutes s seems to repeat its drum fill too many times hile the one minute trace of linoes is conspicuous filler closing the set ith a track as unashamedly radio friendly and do nright nice as s vocal driven ill certainly raise some eyebro s as ell in a ay sums up the hole (mis)adventure of paradigm shift uneven terrain one can cross but not so easily hen fumbling for direction the compilation runs mighty close to performing a disservice to the artists involved and the legacy of paradigm shift sho s there is still a heartbeat but that its perhaps a fading one maybe thats a good thing but judging from the music on offer only time ill reveal hat the shift is (gabler isnt interested in spoiling the surprise and their little functioning ebsite (at the moment) doesnt help much either ) the same goes for hether gablers decision to use the fondly remembered labels name as a good one
premiered two years ago on benji bs bbc radio 1xtra show deviation ahead of 2009 carnival season was first heard as a fierce steel-drum led riddim backed by a swinging broken beat before the big reveal some months later that it was in fact the first new material from pioneering uk soul singer since 2006s sing if you want it lyrically is a straight-up party jam focusing on picking up a fine lady in a club its definitely not s deepest work yet would be no less compelling singing happy birthday the teeth in the vocal department come from a razor sharp sixteen bars by fox who adds a little more rough-and-tumble to the proceedings suiting the overall spirit of the beat perfectly how managed to make swinging caribbean pans with gritty british contemporary club music and classic soul vocals is anyones guess and its part of the reason why he remains such a treasure to the scene but even he cannot better the original its so which gets a remix on the flip blaring horn-blasted double bass belter from sing its so has been a dj staple for years whose charm has been in its almost nuyorican feel which is sadly stripped of its swing and given a much more rigid beat on top that and the fact that some extra elements (such as some disco strings and acoustic guitar) have been added to means this package runs the risk of being overcooked that its been liberated with a vinyl release ahead of brand new studio album however is a cause for celebration
since making his debut on irr in 2013 germany-based british producer put out records on beats in space yum and popnonames pnn imprint who also released his debut album last year on his latest for bristols celebrated outpost karmil delivers three charismatic tracks of scuffed and potent house music the boisterous is six minutes of sonic weaponry that sounds tailor-made for main rooms and festivals dusty and compressed kicks clamour over a stuttering bassline bringing to mind barnts recent output or something youd hear ivan smagghe play circa 2004 provides an interesting counterpoint: its a patient stripped-back creeper with an addictive bassline but karmils track hinges on the achingly sad string sample that briefly appears near the end a sneaky earworm that wont soon leave your head over on the b-side is another slow builder though with a bit more bite crunchy percussion is layered over winding bass and a bleeping main riff rounding out the record with a sturdy club tool
fter trailmixs robo house recasting of you make loving fun and tom crooses nifty and echoey dub down of never going ack gain those symbols of 70s socal pop excess (insert stevie nicks cocaine story here) have come back around as dance floor bombs that trend continues with languages celebratory edit of a tune from his debut album law and order language tightens up mick fleetwoods kick and keeps all the curlicues of sighed ahhs and chimes and ucks always nimble guitar that buoy the productions of his main group stretching them out nice and long and making for a rapturous (hell even drug free) moment on the floor while douglass edit on the flip is not another edit of the man (its apparently some obscure post punk track) it nevertheless conjures the other side of : that of the dark paranoid tweaker (think ledge and tusk ) drums get stripped down to the bone (though not quite to banged on kleenex box levels that the man wouldve deployed) propelled instead by a chiming glockenspiel its all breathless pants and jittery negative space from there sure to cause sweating and heart palpitations
has been referred to as soul claps secret weapon s probably because the san francisco producer has a secret weapon of his own: a velvety voice hes slid over singles like the stalker for s not the only thing that sets him apart from his crew love compadres: monaco also likes lurid butterfly robes and designing his own lipstick the oddest thing about his debut album though isnt his flamboyance but his reluctance to get that secret weapon out part from a few wordless coos monacos voice hardly appears on the opening title track though does introduce another of the albums distinguishing features: sun-bleached guitars his vocals have faint shades of prince when he takes to the mic on babyface but as he sings do you love me he sounds not so much androgynous as strangely sexless duetting with on the pair sound like an all-male mericana-tinged version of the xx as their voices intertwine over spectral guitars the closest monaco gets to being in your face is when he starts yelping m jesus on cant before wandering into a weird monologue about indigo palaces backed by the sort of luxuriantly creamy house soul clap love to milk longside s tale of a party girls nocturnal journeys these are the albums only songs in a traditional sense more often than not monaco uses his voice to simply repeat refrains s not to say he doesnt have fun with it floating through downtempo stoner hip-hop on layering his hums and growls on or propelling the most dance floor-friendly track still just because monaco seems coy about flexing his larynx doesnt mean is an uptight album one of its main joys is the loose rhythms of tracks like with its vaguely frican skank or the way the spaghetti western dub of s stumbles along as blearily as its protagonist nd yet while it feels odd to say this about a man whos posted nude yoga photos on the internet makes you think should expose himself a bit more
life sim is arguably the purest distillation of s naive dayglo style unencumbered by the pop music posturing of other projects like hannah diamond or easyfun life sims music is simple and epic it usually comprises little more than a single synth line some drums and occasionally a donk note or vocal sample but its the hooks that drive it all home so far life sim has released just two 20-minute mixes of all original material like miniature symphonies life sims first proper single comes with a clever music video stitched together from many different big-budget movies a nod to the theatricality the project reaches for despite its simplicity indeed there is a blockbuster quality to which feels like one of those 20-minute sessions condensed down into six as usual its made with bright opaque tones (and glockenspiel) that pluck out a eurodance-style melody speeding up and slowing down at a whim typical of life sim is written in passages taking itself apart and rebuilding a few times it doesnt necessarily go anywhere but the repetition alone helps make that catchy melody feel progressively more urgent theres a certain elegance to it no irony or pretentiousness just pure melody thy one of the more obscure affiliates surfaces for a remix that starts out with elements of classical music before crinkling its nose and throwing down some nasty drums and sputtering samples the rework ends by returning to the majesty of the original with gorgeous organs and chimes its an expectedly bizarre turn rounding off s best single of
whenever a new track emerges from the alleys of south london its a communal thing s you listen for the first time you can imagine thousands of others doing just the very same s resident recluse will evans second release of felt no different ut listening through for the first time i was struck by how profoundly strange it was people all over the world were clamouring to hear a 12-minute suite full of false endings fragmented passages and unresolved melodies for perhaps the first time since originally discovering his self-titled lp i was forced to probe deeper: just how does this music manage to provoke such a visceral response from such a wide berth of people the years first release kindred was his biggest yet the tracks were longer than ever before beefier and packed an emotional wallop that was impressive even by his standards he continues down the epic path apace except where kindred and loner had cinematic builds every time these two new tracks choose a path they suddenly fall apart s stirring chord progressions roiling basslines and intricate vocal manipulation are a recipe for a masterstroke yet none of these things actually occur simultaneously the theatrical motifs are separated by gulfs of percussive tumbles the vocals dragged over a frayed canvas and climax is cruelly snuffed out the 14-minute is much the same but the tracks midsection wavering and tentative has one of evans most beautiful moments s triumphant otherworldly bells fly in from above the rare note of celebration momentarily renders everything clear the entire ep has built up to this moment and its heart-wrenching in an entirely different way than the rest of the catalogue of course all that majesty fades out into licks of static before pulls itself together with some 2006-style roughshod wheeling listeners are left in the lurch as they try to piece together the past 26 minutes is a rather audacious move for an artist who could have easily relied on the same formula for years to come and still struck gold

s 2010 album f life gives lemons make lemonade featured a cover of mr fingers t called tribute london-based talian has since released a number of tracks that werent strictly covers but were so obvious with their samples and unimaginative with their beats that they might as well have been hes also collaborated with some of his biggest influences: sneak for da tonight fatboy slim for the tongue-in-cheek eat sleep rave repeat and on electro-house cut robots now stefano miele teams with chicagos iconic cajual label for his third album which features a list of guests including and lineup on looks ripped from the 90s and its music is no different mieles collaborators give him their stamp of authenticity if not their best work s 303 gurgle on is as typical as its title and re irons out s usual twisted edge f s vocal on sounds like hes speaking over a dodgy mobile signal the beat sounds just as phoned in better are the tracks with daja the chicago diva who graced 90s cajual records like brighter days over the bass wobbles of she wards off those getting between me and my man with her steely cool way she hollers aint no party like a house party somehow isnt the most clich d thing about for that single miele pulls out blatant tricks from the classic house playbook string stabs drum rolls filtered loops hes so shameless in his homage that its almost admirable res a reason those sounds are well-worn: theyre guaranteed to do the job is basically a collection of big crowd-pleasing bangers miele occasionally switches from the raucous energy to say the doleful piano of or the darker but mostly relies on hefty dance floor fillip like the sirens of and s tribal roll those tracks are undoubtedly effective in a club but they ultimately sound uninspired any sense of fun is replaced with dull familiarity after a couple spins isnt pure cheese exactly but it does smell a bit past its sell-by date

raved their way back from the grave once before but the vital signs are that after just ten vinyl releases and s influential and idiosyncratic uk label is finally terminated truth they seemed to be already locked in some sort of endgame around the time of their sixth release by that point s endless reworkings of his tight fisted palette of loose percussion brooding atmospheres and fathomless bass suggested that his work in particular was already on the verge of consuming itself what the pair achieved brilliantly with their remaining releases on the label three of which are collected here with a superb range of remixes was to fully surrender to their perversions and let fantasy run riot on soundboys gravestone gets desecrated by vandals the traits they were already well known for s loopy drum programming and ink stained bass; s spacious clean lines are pushed to psychedelic extremes rather than seeking a way out for their music they found new ways to burrow deeper s tracks and the latter pair co productions with bristols feature unresolved hanging chords textures like brushed steel and softly churning drones that suggest something like la monte ng hitting the bong with digital mystikz taken together theyre some of the most subtly spacious tracks in the dubstep canon but s tracks comprise most of the first disc added little more than tenfold vengeances gothic whisperings to his already familiar style but by the four tracks of the recent soundboys suicide e 12 inch its as if his music is suffering some sort of internal haemorrhage or a bodily mutation as a prelude to some new sound emerging alien like from the wreckage bass bleeds freely and the brooding chords settle into an eerily calm pre apocalyptic zen state yet despite the undoubted quality of and s originals the remixes somehow still manage to outshine them t++s versions of and take dubsteps in and out exhalations of sub bass and remakes them as a mechanoids steely pulse pole contributes his best work for quite some time on a remix of s inserting uncanny moments of silence and opening up its pathways other remixes from geiom and badawi are also seriously imaginative the last of these a 12 minute trip to the heart of the bass that even manages to trump the original afterlife of the catalogue seems just as compelling as the labels actual lifespan the label is dead but the sound lives on
some say that the return to deep house isn t bringing anything new to the table but is newness everything we ve all seen the girls standing by the walls alienated by the narcotic thrust of pummelling techno and the best of deep house will coax them to the floor lift the gloom and bring out the smiles the danger of the genre of course is that the rules are well established and s latest ep on freerange doesn t do much to alter the formula although it s a great improvement on his previous bits cruises at a low speed with driving chords and an interlocking melody that might well go down nicely at a buzzin fly party but the tune of it is too obvious and the arrangement too restrained to please fussier types on the flip will and from simple records beef it up with added clicks and beats unhinging the rigidity of that melody slightly no doubt making it more inviting at higher volumes to floors finally on mr tur wows you with good old handclaps and the effect is a lot fresher than this should have been the has released a lot of music and still is very young and this ep is definitely more toned down and deeper than previous efforts which tended toward the hard and funky (see your love on swedish label refune) but here simple records snatch the gong with their freer remix which is sure to get those wallflower girls smiling not to mention make clued-up types want to delve deeper into simple
politically charged lyrics hard rock ragga rhymes and trip hop all mixed with an indian flavour make up the adf seem to be part of a brand of groups such as fun-da-mental and detri-mental who make indian flavoured music mixed with other styles and featuring lyrics on a political stance is their new album and it sounds like a healthy cross between rage against the machine apollo 440 a bit of assive attack on the slower tunes and apache indian with lashings of tabla percussion sweet indian female vocals and indian instruments the first two tunes fortress europe and rise to the challenge bring out the fiery rage adf seem to have inside them - uptempo and on a hard rock stance whereas la haine follows on starting off on a slow trip hoppy massive attack vibe building up to a charged up climax sinead oconnor has been known for her political stances and who could forget what she did on tv back in 91/92 on 1000 mirrors adf bring out the trip hop with her on vocals slightly dubby and very smoky - portishead fans may warm up to that tune 19 rebellions features brazillian vocals on top of a frenzied ragga beat that sounds similar to apollo 440 blowback and 2 face are mix ups between slowed down rap rock and double tempo drumnbass the snake charmer intro to the first tune is pretty wicked just like the punjabi mc tune power to the small massive features heavy use of the tablas in the intro and is a little bit of indian drumnbass mixed with ragga vocals dhol rinse is an instrumental tune this time featuring the use of the dhol drum alongside some vocal shouts the other instrumental cyberabad uses a really funky bass line with some sweet female vocals laced on top real indian vibes on this one basta brings back the sweet indian female vocals but then rips into an aggressive rock tune and then back again with the female vocals and a few horns to bring out the funk the title tune comes in last - hard electronica breaks with aggressive lyrics on top the cd inlay contains their lyrics in full - pretty interesting lyrics - and a picture of the group - theyre a damn huge group should be interesting to see them out on tour here its a pretty listenable album and for those who like a little indian flavour mixed up with their rock hip hop trip hop and drumnbass is definitely one for you
is certainly a label that has almost been forgotten about but the label that was once the talk of the town makes its long awaited return with a two track release from (gab oliver kaybee) where do you dance is first up and it s a smooth breakbeat infusion of dark eerie effects and rumbling baselines combining with pretty chunky beats that give the production a fair bit of power really solid sounds and twisted effects are the feature of the production towards the latter parts a feature that is well renowned from the boys such as gab oliver in particular comet charge provides a fair bit of the same formula on the b-side solid beats combined with smooth effects and moments of twisted sounds all over a solid baseline foundation is what makes up the guts of this production the production is probably the highlight of this track and the quality of this is what makes this track a little bit better then the norm all in all however this is probably not the amazing return that many were looking fro from but it is a very solid release and that mustn t be overlooked time will tell to see if this release matches the expectations of many for this fine label
it would be a stretch to call tiger woods superstars but for a publicity-shy duo who made their name putting out white-label disco edits theyre remarkably famous in dance music circles djs who play boogie and disco likely own at least one tiger woods 12-inch probably gin nation the imagination-sampling hit from their 2011 debut since then the majority of their music has mined pop r and disco from the 80s onwards and the results are regularly irresistible one thing about tiger woods records though is that they all seem to be assembled in similar ways in particular their tart disco bass and sliced vocal yelps are recurring hallmarks the first few minutes of suggest a tweak to the formula: the duo leave out their shag-pile-thick basslines letting the cosmic vocals ride on a jangling drum track fter four minutes a big synth riff introduces itself and a smooth piano helps propel it all to euphoric heights stands as one of tiger woods most distinctive dj tools the duo stick to time-tested methods on a seven-minute edit squarely rooted in good-time disco guitar and accompanied by childlike vocals and a rich string section tiger woods trademark sound isnt necessarily in need of fixing but scoring clubs pt 2 does refresh it
word biza is never a good omen on a record cover particularly in combination with definitive sounding statements such as is or und of or clubber s guide to rmally this is written in a glossy font slapped over a bikini clad tart with a look on her face that would terrify her mother but hold on before you think of lumping biza: und of vol 4 in with the bargain bin contingent note that there are a couple of factors here that offer a bit of hope firstly it s actually real human being djs in this case and from not some anonymous studio intern with a copy of pro ols and p 0 checklist to run through (although you might never know this you have to look hard to spot their names on the sleeve ) secondly there is a leopard on the cover as opposed to a tart (some may see this as a poor move) s mix titled beach begins on the high note of trentemollers stunning track when you think of the sunny skies of biza you think summery melodies and is full of them unfortunately it is all downhill from here re are some healthy productions here the acid house inspired is sufficiently beachworthy despite its acid riffs while s moody gives the mix a bit of an edge and flow but just when you think it is all heading somewhere it all comes crashing down with productions that are either out of place or quite frankly just not that good anyway right at the death the ever interesting and bjork help things along but the damage has been done already f youre after something soothing for your stint on the beach in biza look elsewhere n contrast club mix is pretty damn decent m talking not just decent for an biza compilation but decent any standard perhaps it lacks the creativity that a mix from a top drawer dj could provide but its got its finger on the pulse of some of the finer tracks youll hear this summer: has a killer earworm of a main riff; carl s remix of ction is still a quality head pounder even if it comes in a touch early here; and nhance is classic four in the morning in biza stuff nother highlight is bers delightfully melodic which is quite similar to sea of sand but a worthy track in its own right said this is a pretty damn decent t also has a nice variety to it running through straight up house music electro house and even a bit of minimal have released a groundbreaking classic here certainly not but thats not the point of a release like this re is a lot of summery music to enjoy here especially on the club disc and sometimes thats enough job done then
theres a casual elegance to nick wilsons productions his drums are baggy like theyre being played live and his melodies shimmer this is perhaps the natural product of someone raised on a diet of broken beat hip-hop and jazz genres that tend to avoid quantized sounds in favour of something that feels more human than machine that style helped the london producer break out on 2012s gorgeous synthetes wilson returns to what he does best on his excellent second ep for channels synthetes without being a copy it has an uplifting three-note melody that twists subtly throughout the tune mirrored by different instruments as strings flutter in between but its the creative bassline which breaks and meanders instead of merely repeating thats most impressive sidling up to the new age revival features glassy vocal pads and more wandering basslines its easy to get swept up in its slow luxurious waves nebraska straightens out with a vintage touch replacing the rhythm section with old breaks and a simpler bassline his remix is more functional than the original but it retains wilsons easygoing spirit

aka tom giles uses computer sounds and sparse downtempo beats to create quirky head-nodding tracks that crunch lurch and crunk their way along like a lost ghoul going back to the boneyard has the same kooky appeal as metronomys slower songs but with a larger palette that includes the influence of dub soundtracks hip hop and 80s consoles but whilst they are very listenable some of these tracks noodle a bit and dont develop very much which is a pity because theres some lovely touches and many signs of a curious mind the first track has breathy vocals from nancy elizabeth cunliffe the latest signing to the leaf label which puncture casio synth stabs and a politely farty bass the pairing of the single word utterances and the mechanical groove give it a lovely metallic humanity is the most upbeat of them all and gives wevie stonder a run for their money in the wonky dancefloor stakes the ghostly effects and weird breathing would i reckon make it the perfect accompaniment to a zombie courting dance by no means is this going to be a conventional dancefloor bomb but on a large soundsytem it would definitely cause some damage the final track soul ( ) reaches for (but doesnt quite get to) aim levels of round-the-fire cosiness like aims tracks it has touching strings and a childlike melody played on what appears to be a glockenspiel but unlike aims multi-layered and fully formed tracks it pretty much repeats this for four minutes which is frustrating elsewhere starts off well but unfortunately slips somewhere between a porn soundtrack and doctors waiting room music some loveable tracks here then but just as many which are little more than stretched out skits
countless words have been written about paul roses transformation from gloomtastic dubstepper to fear-no-neon denizen of peaktime even months after his third full-length personality the apparent apex of his bombastic new sound im still coming to grips with the sort of sunshine thats followed such profoundly persistent drizzle following roses remix of recondites jaded the darkest cut in a minute that still managed to be the most uplifting track on the much-lauded on cid recondite completes the trade by offering two renditions of personality s stadium-sized first single s youd expect from on cid s soothingly downtrodden techno the erliner takes things down more than a few notches though the results are mixed if one were to pick a signature element of it would likely be s dare-i-say rap you know the one about having the system and all that it couldnt not sound a little ridiculous but amidst so many grinding synths and fog-machine blasts it kind of worked maybe even brilliantly set amongst the rainy-day drums and blurry drones of recondites ride mix all of which is wonderfully restrained and delicate in its own right it just sounds ridiculous caveat-free that resigned sigh recondite leaves in at the end of the track basically sums it up: when the track ends its a relief to get some air after all that awkwardness promenade mix thankfully makes more creative and cohesive use of the source material adding up to one of recondites finest sides yet: pairing the originals driving beat with expansive pads it moves from superclub to gothic cathedral
is one most promising figures to hold up when talking about everything-but- -kitchen-sink bass music to put it mildly epitomizes this the atlanta producers debut on uk label is packed to brim with wild percussion riding crests imperceptible waves saturated with vocal samples and low-end quakes worthy dmz that already sounds chaotic but also obsessively plays with tracks structure pulling it apart and into new shapes almost as quickly as its drums skitter across surface it makes five minutes feel like twelve (in a good way) n couldnt help but seem tame in comparison though its certainly no less active: same frantic layered drum lines and angry chipmunk vocals are assuaged by gentle strings and later uprising hoovers floating on same frenzied foundation bassy fidget as the ep comes packed with a load remixes best being label head sindens rework where he refigures heart tune into a sloping house rhythm and uses s quirky sound effects as accents ra r than focus capracara takes a similarly laidback but less successful approach turning staccato into staid while houston-based wheez-ie gets two footworky goes at the remixes on a single as strong as arent really necessary though because when youre already way ahead everyone else its hard to think o rs contributions as anything but irrelevant
it speaks to speed brian leeds development that by time the guardian heard outsider house hed long since left reductive descriptor behind while that term might have applied to earlier releases like aphelias theme on future times or r e g a l i a for anthony naples proibito label (as royal crown of sweden) kansas natives first full-length has very little to do house music on surface sure re is ten a 4/4 pulse and re are even recognizable semi-danceable drum beats but skews a lot closer to ambient sound collage than anything youre likely to hear in a club the albums overall mood is drowsy and tempos are suitably slow almost every texture is robbed its lustre and melodies languish in dusty half-finished states while so much todays gritty beat experiments feel urban feels rural like a sort corrupted pastoral tracks like of and are purely abstract constructions but strange grooves hidden in clouds crackle and hiss u s a chugs along at a quickened pace its one-bar bassline looping into infinity the whole thing almost takes f when kick drops back in for last section but instead it drifts to a close is similar built on a persistent head-nodding groove that doesnt really need to go anywhere to be effective the textural detail is immaculate: each track is exactly as washed out and strange as leeds wants it to be as loose as y are y feel well-crafted and well-mixed as a collection tracks made from short loops and o rworldly samples is an easy fit for oneohtrix point nevers label indeed fingerprint daniel lopatins own work is hard to miss especially on tracks like or there is a similarity in mood in wasted empty weirdness tracks at almost an hour in length album does lag a bit in places but by time beautiful shining tones phase have faded into e r all is forgiven is not a flawless record but it does open up a whole new world possibilities for leeds as a producer and places him decisively outside any box people might wish to put him in
there are a couple ways of looking at the music charlotte de witte makes viewed from one angle its a simple effective take on big-room techno; viewed from another its a sound with little originality whatever you think about this (and the many other releases in this style) techno this stripped-back tends to sink or swim based on small details the placement of a hit-hat the choice of the kick drum on the ep for the dutch label black de witte makes some decent decisions and winds up with one of the stronger releases of her relatively short career the vocal refrain on could seem a little trite but its the sort of flourish thatll mark it out among similarly styled tracks especially on the big european dance floors she plays to these days the primitive acid line that plays off against the kick drum only seals the deal uses almost identical elements but it feels like a less distinctive version of the title track has the eps only clear melody a sombre pad that works nicely in tandem with an indecipherable voice in the background de witte allows the pad to fade from view around halfway leaving the heaving drums and bassline to gallop towards the tracks finish line
makes house music with the heart of a singer/songwriter and the soul of 90s hip-hop samples are treated like memories captured cherished and shared and songs tell stories that play out like secondhand d j vu the brighton-based artist used childhood keepsakes to write his breakout record 2014s music for the uninvited pieces from his mothers record collection old video games mixtapes and more built the foundation for seven flawless tracks which ranged from bright and wistful to lush and groovy vynehall wanted to produce music for dancing as much as he wanted to reveal a part of himself and that balance was enchanting subsequent records have held the even keel: butterflies was a filter-house bomb with personality to spare and midnight on rainbow road set dusk-lit kosmische against a beatless shimmy even these standalone singles seemed to speak to something beyond dance floors as murmurs of musical history bled into vynehalls emotional palette gone were the low-hanging thrills of brother and gold language replaced with a range of influences (disco soul jazz etc ) that showed an artist digging deeper into his craft then takes a step back two years after music for the uninvited marked vynehall as a crossover success his second mini-lp stays on the fertile ground of breezy sample-based house one of its best tracks is a mood hut-like groover full of balmy atmosphere and delicate flourishes how the dusty piano chords in filter around live bass notes evokes butterflies heard on a yacht at sunset it all vibrates with the energy of a meticulous yet easygoing producer whose attention to detail supercedes raw personal expression and thats the difference here: vynehall has left the spotlight to focus on his surroundings where his best music was like reading pages from a diary can feel like a passionate retelling of memories that were never his a less personalized record would be no problem after all this is music made for dance floors first and foremost if only there were more highlights packed into it is quality across the board no doubt but it never surpasses expectations that sense of normalcy hits by the third track when anchors to a trite vocal loop ( r love is all i want / r love is all i need ) and cant elevate itself above orchestral stabs and a simple house beat from a distance the tune could pass for disclosure later hopes to take on the role of its just ( of dupree) but it overshoots the anthemic floor-filling sweet spot those gaudy diva cries and sweeping strings soon grow tiresome also cant match the weightless beauty of inside the deku tree and st sinclair though this is an alluring opener rife with melodic color and graceful movement its counterpart there is a bright percussive fling that leaves the record feeling open-ended is the lithuanian word for paradise which is the core theme here vynehall strings these eight tracks together with recordings of tropical birds and their mating calls meant as a metaphor for club-goers intermingling on a night out its an interesting enough concept but is ultimately too self-contained for all the clatter and glow of theres no depth beyond its slinky groove nor does life emanate from the abundance of birdsong and hand drums in kiburus as much as vynehall intended illustrates a hidden place distant and uninhabited
manchesters one half of akkord with synkro makes his debut on samurais deeper drum bass subsidiary red seal with what could be his best solo release yet compacts all the aspects of liam blackburns musical personality into a dizzying whole youve got the sensibility for sweeping atmospherics he shares with synkro the pinpoint precision of loud/silent dynamics of akkord and his penchant for drum bass bangers topped off with a dollop of jungle the most impressive cut here has the metal chords and snap-of-the-whip rhythms we know from akkord but replaces the techno beats with jungle breaks holds the breaks between deeply sighing vocals and the result fast shiny and inhuman is like cybernetic jungle res no drop just the endless lash of manipulated drums and a swell of dubby chords at the end tension is near to breaking point for the entire thing title track ditches the straight-up junglisms and has more in common artists like fracture and om unit with assorted drum sounds flying at breakneck speeds but delivered with an almost dubstep-ish swing rounding things off is which is more of a dub techno number coasting along on an easygoing 4/4 pulse steadily cruising its eerie and beautiful in its own strange way
the first various artists release from a sub label of dublins all city comprised a single 12 inch a year and a bit later vol ii sprawls over three instalments and features international names alongside local oddball talent part ii boasts the compilations best track which comes courtesy of manchesters the meandyou cofounder nods to kassem mosse on a slow mo electro groover with the wheezy grace of the leipzig producers best work the other away player is whose is a characteristic loop track intriguing and strangely funky but a bit too long the other tracks come from new ish local artists and are various kinds of rumpled house music this sound has been explored extensively in the 10s and the jheri crew tackles it proficiently if not always with flair s makes the pilgrimage to chicago its mr fingers style bassline and biscuit tin drums flavoured with dreamy chords that sidechain themselves into every fold of the mix s ups the weirdness with crazy chord stabs and a theremin lead theres a hint of garage to its beat a quirk shared with s the latter track lingers in breakdown stasis closing out the compilation with featherlight chords and dabs of perky melody
one of the things that r s recent mutek oral history crystallized was the idea that canadian artists in the late 90s and early 00s needed to leave their home country to truly flourish from a gigging standpoint the argument could also be made however that the same is true for their production: free to work in the studio for extended periods of time without a day job to worry about these artists have finally found their own language to speak in one that isnt translated through detroit chicago toronto or even erlin where many of them now reside fter many years of living in the city you get the sense that finally one of those canadian ex-pats is finally finding his own production language or that its finally resonating marshall has an ep out on simple an imprint that has nothing to do with the canadian scene as well as the sterling north at night ep already to his name in nd as good as those releases are might be the best its chunky house beat is unremarkable but the radio transmissions and synth programming are anything but the sampled radio is used unlike kufen underneath as coloring appearing every so often for a moment to remind you of its existence while the synths lay out a long glowering phrase the best part when most everything cuts out aside from a voice telling us were getting to be toward the official peak doesnt match the heights of but its still a solid track taking a echoing synth stab as its raison d tre and going all tony lionni with it every so often its a playful little tune and one that can probably have great use as set builder but im having trouble getting past most times that i break this out i anticipate you will too
there are many reasons why is so long-lived but one is its capacity for sniffing out music that transcends its context back when dubstep was in the ascendant the likes of vexd and pinch brought the sound to new audiences through landmark releases on the label and now as instrumental grimes new wave has broken across the blogosphere mike paradinas and co are at it again even disregarding his credentials (hes co-founder of boxed and head of the gobstopper label) mr mitch is a shoe-in for such a signing in recent times the london producer has developed a wonderful melodic sense that nods to all kinds of worlds beyond grime whether its the twinkly idm of paradinas youth darkstar-style synth-pop or 80s ambient noodlings dont takes that crossover impulse and runs with it theres definitely still a grime influence here in the bold structures and the occasional sonic tic but mostly what stands out are the melodies wonderful earworming things simple but endlessly pleasurable in a manner similar to mssingnos smash xe2 only more delicately handled the title track is the real crowdpleaser its titular lovelorn sample sculpted into a head-hung heart-strong ballad whose melody will rattle round the skull for hours there and on the gothic the drums do little more than keep time; the latters lacklustre claps barely do that and its the only point where mitch lets things sit a little too still elsewhere he proves he can handle a groove when he wants to the most conventional of the lot slouches along in languid hip-hop style even better is whose sparse halftime beat and pitchblack sub-bass throb wouldnt sound out of place on a vintage dmz record paired with layers of dissonant synth arps pattering like raindrops on a lamplit car window the effect is gripping
just look at that album cover luke chable and danny bonnici cool as cucumbers what with their shades and gangsta lean looking down at you all condescending-like it s as if they were thinking you thought ride our hit collabo from a few years back was dope well check this out and then they dive into some been-there-heard-that boring electrohouse the end that about sums up chable and bonnici s mix hiddenform 001 the first compilation on dimitri frosts new label of the same name the point of the series appears to be showcasing tracks from little-known producers alongside bigger names with a few from the duo thrown in for good measure the mix starts with a track in the first category freshly-signed hiddenformer daniel taylor s 5 ur ears it s a terrible choice for two reasons: one that it s track one; and two that it s supposed to represent the new label s sound 5 ur ears is just a wheezy slog from start to finish made all the worse because the grating synth stabs and low-frequency bass drops try so desperately to sound playful and danceable fellow upstarts john morgan kevin shui don t fare much better with the second track acid brownies but things start to pick up when the martinez remix of each s broken bitch drops a tight squelchy production with samples from a cautionary tale of crack addiction to make it all the sleazier zen kei s the blast (gregor tresher remix) is a hiddenform highlight taking the relentless 4/4 down a dark alley of twisted synths but robert babicz s mister head is easily the comp s best track heavily layered but with a heart of gold and a short-but-sweet breaks build-up to boot lifelike chris menace s neon skyline comedown discopolis is a solid track but would ve worked infinitely better as the hiddenform closeout rather than being sandwiched in the middle instead wrap-up duty is left to chable and bonnici first up is danny s break da house which you guessed it combines the man s well-documented love for both breaks and house it has a very cool hybrid sound of the two genres: a stuttering devastating bass line over a 4/4 rhythm that suddenly if not unexpectedly breaks into breaks about halfway through chable s contribution is far below danny s as his assembly-line electrohouse production is about as half-assed as the track s title swedish meatballs (i don t know) hiddenform 001 might be okay if experienced live; it s well mixed the whole way through and the bass in particular shines on almost every track but you ll need a few drinks if you intend to go start-to-finish in your living room as more often than not chable and bonnici s effort is simply put boring; just another cruel beating of the electrohouse horse even if the mix does showcase fresh producers and exclusive tracks it doesn t help that everything still sounds so samey these guys should head back to the drawing board and make ride 2 because that track really was dope
if his latest release as is any indication its safe to say that peter kersten does not suffer from seasonal ffective disorder the records title waves goodbye to the daylight its three lush downtempo tunes embracing a nocturnal solace or wait maybe its the other way around: maybe the guy gets s d so badly that only producing warm melancholic deep house gets him through those sunless months in any case its great record if youre planning to dj a cabin anytime soon or an apr s-ski gathering its fireplace vibes add new meaning to a warm-up set strikes a bit of an upbeat note in comparison to its predecessors is a nicely peppy number with a big hi-hat and gorgeous cascades of piano matched with string swells the title tracks in a good mood too with spare bursts of keyboard figures over gently shifting grooves the shakers in charge here phased and echoed stitching the tracks warm ambience into a danceable whole only exudes typical lawrencian mope but as usual its a mope laced with a kind of moody anticipation like watching the sun go down over a vast cityscape replaced by a field of neon specks in the darkness

when the name comes up in conversation its not long before someone reminisces about the first time they heard scared your face or when they first heard a dj set from him hes widely regarded as being before his time and to this day that tag still stands as being one of the pioneers of the dance music scene having to date put out a long string of ass kicking beats on endless labels including his own jukebox in the sky hell hes even had hand in riverdance first up is goddam waspy noize which almost instantly is recognizable as a track from with distinctive guitar riff that gives a flavour of scared and seduces us to listen more but thats only a tease as proceedings take a peaktime pace with a toxic mix of neatly stitched broken beats acidic synthlines and underlying vocal samples that lift the tone while the main vocal exclaims that this is goddam noize next take is goddam voodoo noise which takes a twisted view adding a tribal groove with 4/4 beats and a techier spin with ear twangling rezd stabs and tweaked energetic synthlines along with vocal cuts to push the aggressive edge track two tutikinegi is a more laid back affair with lush spacey melodies that glide over a broken groove with ease and creative an emotive flow throughout the tone is set as the track lifts further with sublime vocals that compliment the soothing atmosphere that flowers beautifully the second ost mix of tutikinegi is much the same as the first mix but with a closer look at whats happening throughout and focusing on tweaking a few more sounds adding in a few more subtle uplifting melodies supercedes the tag dj producer with an always fresh and exciting twist to his sound that continues to refresh
a label based in montevideo uruguay is one of experimental club musics most exciting new prospects its third release brazilian producer s six-track h lices ep shows why its so hotly tipped on the eps title track pairs the hand drum rhythms of brazilian baile funk with sci-fi sound design creating an exciting combination of acoustic and digital offers a whiff of grime and jersey club though theyre more like rhythmic inflections than outright references its tough to ascribe these tracks to a certain time or space not just because they draw from different regional sounds but also because of the clash between organic and synthetic textures its like theyre from this world but also not by prioritizing innovation some so-called experimental club producers have forgotten that many of us are here to dance but h lices will light up a dance floor walks a razors edge between abstraction and approachability reeling things back in with rhythms that dancers will find tough to resist and he doesnt go off the deep end when he does get weird like on an unassuming drum track that whips up a wicked slow groove without much fanfare the remixes are full of fresh ideas too san francisco producer foozool is psychedelic on her rework of adding synth flourishes that skip up and down the scale in restless middle eastern glissandos h lices gets a psychotic remix from umurmurum that switches tempo twice as it slouches towards total breakdown spiralling into incomprehensible chaos in its final moments

s cover of love and rockets references pretty much everything that is wrong with dance music throwing all of the genre s aesthetic clich s into a blender and dishing the results out over a needlessly prolonged eight-minute running time is the sort of thing can imagine satan plays to torture club kids in hell m sure that after the millionth spin on beelzebub s decks the track could potentially start to sound downright catchy but thats a totally improbable scenario here in the mortal world it s simply grounds for walking out of a club that being said the remixes don t fare much better matthew dear listed as remixer raises a glimmer of hope but as the old adage goes you can t polish a turd and it holds true as ever in this instance sure it s a far more listenable track in comparison to the original (you can credit that to dear s treatment of those atrocious vocals chopping them down into truncated slices and then looping them atop each other to hypnotic effect) but in the end it just becomes repetitive and quite frankly boring as he repeats the same trick over and over for a full nine minutes booka meanwhile manage only to meet expectations which have been lowered by a string of underwhelming releases since last year s dj kicks mix the booka boys strip back the original s sheer sonic excess only to replace s squelching analog synth riffs and arena-ready drums with tedious effects processing and a wandering interlude that destroys the track s flow las thanks to the high profiles of the artists involved these tracks have been getting heavy play based on name recognition alone this is unfortunate considering the sheer mediocrity of the material fans will simply sweep this release under the rug and wait patiently for his next tightly machined slab of minimal techno to drop while his detractors will no doubt see this as yet another opportunity to call mr shirazinia s minimal credentials into question whichever way you spin it it s just bad music

it will probably come as the most meagre of surprises to hear that this record plays the sound loud and clear: stark basslines crisp drums and a sun bleached disco vibe thats not just because its a label sampler but also because are a particularly consistent brand as many of the most successful names in music they reflect current trends in a way that can seem standard when viewed from a distance but in actual fact each track removes itself from the median in a deftly judged and unique way that can for some make every new release difficult to resist buying this canny business sense rolls on the first of two post summer samplers these are house grooves but is an especially snappy one is on the haltering side and has particularly loose joints more significantly the style of everything around the grooves (i e the melodic bits) sets their overall personalities in a similar manner in essence a soulful pop ballad sees ali love continue to climb the ranks of house vocalists this is the first output of his new project luca c (theres another lucas partner brigante making its way onto no 19) and its a rather promising one its smooth soft deep house driven by a catchy bass motif and lyrics addressing his lady; the one playing the games in question whether based on reality or not he makes it sound strikingly honest offers something weirder featuring ample but tight echo and delay vocals cut into vibrating indecipherable sound effects and wormlike synth hooks s track is full of age worn motown strings piano stabs vocal cuts and of course that chunky analogue bass

could it be so simple yes it can says on under its producer zak khutoretskys debut bow on derrick mays legendary imprint and he takes after the celebrated producer with clean lines propulsive beats and an ear for the dramatic what else do you need may made his name on the formula before quitting to become a full-time high tech soul dj evangelist plenty have followed in his footsteps since is no different nd yet he is khutoretskys synths on under are fuller rounder more vibrant its as though hes taken all of the energy that someone like ricardo villalobos puts into the micro and pours it into the macro oth of the melodies that drive the two tracks here positively sing pushing and pulling the drums to keep the pace hi-hats tick excitedly bells quiver like jellyfish static cuts through the air like a knife its the flipside to erghains raw techno reveling in how absolutely empty the space behind the music can be s en klocks recent mix on which features proves though techno is a circle not a straight line it fits in perfectly with a set from one of the genres finest djs because good music is good music no matter the sound its just that simple
dventure adds another smashing cut to the recent resurgence in piano house a style that requires bold and steady hands and not only those pounding out the chords the piano is such an expressive instrument the sound of its keys so immediately emotional that using it effectively in a dance song requires a tightrope walk youve got to trust your balance while remaining on guard against the gravitational pull of kitsch pull this off by juxtaposing chunky revved-up chords against an occasional waterfall of cascading treble so that youve got a steady punch of rhythm spiced up with just the right dose of ivory glitz put em together with swirling filters and dashes of acid basses that punch and dazzling claps and youve got yourself a party mover its another successful step in wursts transition from an edits imprint of no small renown to a full-fledged label dventure flows and swaggers in such a human way one wonders if all the hours the wursters spent in the disco-edits lab have helped them in turn to craft such live-feeling house music evident as well on the labels inaugural release rennan greens aptly-titled my first house flipside dventure takes the slow-burn route offering up a druggy bricklayer groove which serves as a backdrop for some heavily goofy robot sex talk: two droids walk into a bar and case the place for potential conquests hey baby wanna interface its humorous in a sketch-comedy way and considering the context (electronic club music) its not completely inappropriate for the tune to accompany a couple of bots on the prowl the salacity of the is further underscored by their name which is most likely a reference to the drum and a 70s disco outfit responsible for tawdry cuts like touch me where its hot ultimately though the dialogue here is little more than a cringe-worthy lark in well-worn territory the tune doesnt hold a candle to its waxen companion so stick with the -side and watch it light up the floor
a few weeks back agorias ra podcast tied up some of the best in dance music over the past decade including king ritts juggernaut remix of josh ones contemplation just in case youve been holding out for a sequel all these years then im afraid ritts latest soubriquet will disappoint if youre into 80s sci-fi soundtracks however its immediately apparent on this release that ritt has a love of vangelis and especially john carpenter latter both directed and wrote the oppressive paranoid music which accompanies his tense dystopian nightmare escape from new york ritts obsession is readily some might say shamefully apparent in opener ; constructed with analogue gear its a too brief homage to carpenter all growling bass keys drawn out synths and primordial digital percussion openers brevity is in direct contrast to the sprawling with its kraftwerkian teutonic flavour and neck-snapping electro rhythm longer still is the final cut lilouts a ten-minute plunge into an aphex twin-style ambient electronic bubble bath an ep that acts as a beautiful counterpoint to house musics current vogue for bedroom analoguistas
has gradually built a dedicated following with trippy house on modest labels like untilmyheartstops syncrophone and his own inimeg s with many of his east coast peers the new jersey producers tracks are steeped in ambient sound and he emphasizes their more psychedelic properties letting odd bits of instrumentation and drowsy samples hang in the air its a style that makes his tracks feel like theyre drifting by in a fog and paints nderson as more suited to the album format than most which might be what dutch label saw when they commissioned him to write one result is a resolutely dance floor album that isnt afraid to plumb the depths of what he calls deep outlines the blueprint for s well-established style with the usual assortment of plinking pianos brittle drums and enveloping soundscapes his true talent lies in his subtle arrangements and his knack for hypnotic repetition two songs on are near-perfect iterations of this style gently syncopated its is a lesson in restraint at 113 bpm with a near-whisper of a vocal sample and a careful 303 simmering on the other hand is like a never-ending live jam with synths that twirl in fractal patterns its a languid eight minutes but the drums have a jazzy sensibility that makes them feel as if they could go on forever without getting tiresome from there nderson explores the outer reaches of his sound gestures towards techno but with a warm flow like an ocean current gently pulling the melodic elements in its wake on the ambient side of things he turns the techno-album-interlude clich on its head producing two gorgeously textured standouts with the new age-y and that the ambient tracks are among the albums strongest says a lot about nderson dmittedly doesnt add any new tricks to his repertoire but it doesnt need to his brilliance is a humble kind and hes not trying to reinvent the wheel in his interview with r nderson said that he tries to humanize tracks and make them related to some kind of human experience and thats just what he does here invites you to cherish its every rustle and warm drum hit to feel what it feels
this limited edition vinyl only release is the third outing on the new label from the founder of st lo and matt radio slave edwards the imprint is named after the diner in twin peaks and its first two eps were named after the diners staff this one references its signature dessert and finds french producer turning in on the side it rests on a rubbery almost obby orlando ish electro bassline and pumping percussion assertive ingredients that are spacily offset by willowy pads its a pleasingly linear lengthy number that should be a useful mid set tool for a wide array of djs producer known only as contributes eetlejuice more rugged proposition than its predecessor it chugs away on a bed of hats and a hard edged bassline under which gentle background chimes and intermittent dialogue samples from twelve monkeys add further ambience to an atmospheric package that suggests will be a label to watch in 2014

is the album that brought rvng tl and pianist composer david moore together the test-pressings for the debut bing ruth lp which got a limited release in 2010 were mistakenly sent to rvng boss matt werth by his distributor werth reached out to moore and the result was the gorgeous 2014 highlight tomorrow was the golden ge remastered and expanded for this release is clearly a stepping-stone on the way to that singular album moores ensemble is larger but less tightly marshalled: in the course of his drifting meditative compositions woodwinds strings and molten flows of lapsteel guitar sit apart where twgt blends its materials into a shimmering whole the second bing ruth album felt strangely depopulated and was all the more engrossing for it sounds like an ensemble playing together (there are even voices though they dont go so far as to sing words ) structurally too moore didnt quite nail it the best of s longer tracks are pleasantly sprawling like which unspools over 12 minutes or which features a welcome repetition of the opening track the worst stray towards the grand pomp of post-rock: hesitates for ages then spends its last four minutes at a dramatic climax we know that moore can walk less familiar paths and spend less time dawdling along the way nonetheless the album has its blissful moments has a wonderful trudging melancholy to it; the following track lifts us gently out of the funk three bonus tracks included with the re-release are almost as good though they stretch the album to a daunting 75 minutes s main effect is to make you appreciate the charms of its successor all the more s main effect but not its only one
has been an inspiration for european house in last few years but whe r he cares or not is anybodys guess still on computer games unreleased expansion pack 0 2 he continues to build bridges or at least do with erghain resident en picked as a remixer in 2006 when was releasing deathly cold techno on ostgut-ton this collaboration would have been hard to imagine but se days technos temperature has risen considerably chandlers x 1-1000 is a perfect example of fiery us glow thats got clubs sweating cacophony of hard-edged percussion forms a shuffling house beat before a duel of his interplanetary organs s with all best chandler records its a one riff triumph the percs an exercise in raw precision skip in and out giving this track that unmistakable us swing as a red-hot key sequence is played a hundred different ways seems youve got to be rough to play smooth on flip remixes and i guess its not that surprising that result comes out sounding a bit like carl craig though not quite as box office creates an atmosphere that evokes his early productions: its a little frosty but with ghost of an organ lurking and detroit strings that seem to drone in slow motion (even with added us flavor youd know this was producer who brought us dead man watches clock ) its pensive early morning techno mapping dreary fade from summer into autumn with a stoic gravitas
things that make purely textural techno good are hard to pinpoint when youve got no hooks its hard to understand exactly why your pulse is climbing describing s debut on his own label is tough res a sub so deep in its more like a sleepy draw of breath than anything audible but it provides a bed for drums that pump through a miasma of reverb res a single half-heard synth that echoes through almost the only tangible sound in a stew of echo res the laser that zips across the chuntering drums in to the a flash of light through cloud but then dissecting into moments isnt useful ll that matters is that for all its abstraction or indeed because of it this is great music its warm and fuzzy like the clamber from sleep into wakefulness everything here would slot into a five m berghain set a dozy reverie where you feel like youre the only person on the dance floor
listening to the likes of kenny dixon jr and larry heard its easy to think that they didnt set out to write house tracks but that their music fits into the larger continuum of black music and just happens to get people moving the idea seems echoed in a recent quote from (aka funkineven) about his debut album he told the wire is exactly where im at in my head at the moment and hopefully forever ive been a fan of jazz fusion and proper music proper scores for years and years and it feels like everything ive released has just been dance floor related though he claims to be turning his back on dance music juliens lp actually has a number of excellent club cuts but he does broaden his scope demonstrating a knack for jazz-fusion and soundtrack-style work alongside his usual drum tracks and funked-up house there are two distinct halves to as evidenced by its two front covers (one depicts julien blowing blunt smoke in a nod to umpteen 90s hip-hop albums while the other is a photo of him in a convertible by a beautiful beach vista ) the instrumental record borrows its concept that of a fallen angel from the bible starting in a utopic zone and ending in the dark of night on heaven is a beautiful set of chords beatless intro is a cool wave of descending rhodes countless synths and even a wild modal jazz solo looks back to juliens west london roots and time spent at the co-op broken beat night at plastic people they set the stage for a perfect piano house track that juliens been sitting on for 15 years s midsection consists of three interludes representing the transition from good to evil or day to night plods along cheerfully minding its own business before being usurped by the twilight of that ones rough kick looms in the background while minor-key arpeggios and piano build an ominous mood at the end the synths become blurry and obscured like the last bit of purple fleeing from the night sky if is the light halfs obvious highlight steals the show on the dark half mixing a tough rolling bassline with dubby ethereality just like omar-s tracks like and frame juliens dance floor aversions as a creative conceit an idea used to inspire a stylistically varied album but these two prove hes still very much down with the djs trades in the acidic menace of funkineven eps like apron 001 and species while is built around a wild breakbeat wraps with s plaintive roland chords concluding the story of epic spiritual drama on a mournful note whether or not matches the scale of its concept it contains juliens most musically accomplished work to date hes still a dance producer but he tells a compelling nuanced story

has released a vast amount of music under various aliases populating posh isolation the label he founded with christian stadsgaard and klaus h hansen with releases that vary from brutal industrial to sugary pop he once called posh isolation a monument in progress likening its projects to separate bricks within that space his contributions have included the abusive performance art of damien dubrovnik a collaboration with stadsgaard and the power electronics of caucasian colony and lr more recently hes produced dark and beautiful ambient music as croatian mor and pastel synth pop in the trio lust for youth ssembled over a two-year period in copenhagen and at ems a studio in stockholm where rahbek was an artist in residence bears traces of all these other projects rahbeks best work sets the sublime against the excruciating which he then modulates into sonorous and discordant soundscapes and are the best examples of this on n anxious high-pitched note is held through the latter but its midsection is drowned out by a swell of warm strings s harsh electronics could bore through flesh and bone but its blasts of colour make rahbeks sonic torture a little easier to bear you can detect instruments throughout the album but aside they are usually corrupted in some way theres the percolating piano on that sounds like a degraded recording or the tired accordion groans of s finest attribute is not so much the sounds that rahbek uses as the way he treats them rahbek sets an ominous mood with layers of drone then introduces a throbbing aural wave that morphs and grows with each subtle tweak the album has many such pockets that invite deep listening might not have as much bite as say the puce mary collaboration of the female form nor does it quite reach the emotive heights of croatian mor but its a great introduction to rahbeks music in general

as londons old apparatus began to step out of the shadows in 2012 asher levitas revealed himself to have the sunniest disposition of the trio his solo ep under the oa banner alfur was almost poppy its autotuned vocal and 2-step rhythms recalling mount kimbie in places these tendencies were given freer rein in the grandiose synth-pop of saa a collaboration with vocalist linn carin dirdal that yielded an ep for left_blank last year levitas new label overshare will were told host more saa material in the future but kicking off the imprint is a new collaboration which sets the pop gestures to one side to focus on old apparatus-style electronic abstraction levitas handles the music while writer and artist michael crowe supplies accompanying psychedelic video-collages unfortunately levitas material isnt quite strong enough to withstand scrutiny like much old apparatus output these three tracks sit between styles in a way that could be intriguing but is often just frustrating the meandering pen 1 cant seem to decide what it is: dank kosmische (for the first few minutes) stolid techno (at the midpoint) or r b-sampling electronica (shortly after) we do eventually reach some kind of agreement between these competing forces but it takes an awfully long time to get there pen 1 and pen 2 are more concise the former scrambles more r b vocals over stultifying percussion; the latter is poised somewhere between stomping squat-techno and visionist-style melancholia unfortunately in both cases the hi-end is mixed piercingly loud and the kicks ineffectually quiet leaving the whole thing feeling cluttered and exhausting on the ear
so what ten things do you need to know about friendly well youll learn them here as each of the ten tracks has been given the friendly touch by andrew kornweibel whose style of breaks is versatile and above all great to listen to global stomp his own track is a surprisingly ambient opening in some respects with a well judged piano but daddys come back is remixed to a tee with a brilliant bass snip friendlys two choice mixes though are sl2 and lfo on a ragga tip falls under the influence very easily with a devilishly funky rhythm while lfo retains the stop-start of the original but with a wicked breakbeat in tow elsewhere friendly appears to have an obsession with domination - fetish sneaker sex and s m are all good tracks though the latter sporting a distorted vocal and a slinky breakbeat what makes friendly a winner is the accessibility of his breaks style whilst managing not to sell out in a commercial sense each track here is strongly rhythmic and well mixed with more than enough variety for an album - something that cant be overestimated friendlys sets and productions have won him quite a fanbase particularly in australia and these ten tracks are the things you do need to know about friendly watch him go
for two producers known for swollen big-eyed bedroom compositions dominik eulberg and gabriel nanda seem to join hands only when mania sets in oth joint traum releases 2006s harzer roller and 2007s kirschplunder jasmin tee bei gabriel twisted the duos taste for relatively white-tablecloth techno into fingerfood extravaganzas: louder sloppier and less restrained ut its now where both producers revel in the outlandish and really let their cuffs drag in the gravy the title track spasms and heaves a jagged series of synth blurts and hectic rhythms that collide and scatter in a circular fashion ut for such a crude floor-based draw the duo stresses its meticulous composition jolly flailing with a precise departure time the crassest funkiest release of their partnership it makes the most of its ten-plus minutes receding into a bouncy charge only to stretch into smeary stretches of melody collections of sound and small static stitches that artfully coalesce into shape s it unravels though something clearly comes unhinged a moment of sweaty dementia thats perhaps a little crude in how expressly it searches out its own repeated climax the -side ill though just as hyperbolic in its aims is a damn charming throwback piece of almost-trance that brings a narrative to its ten-minute progression evolving from a rippling two-fold synth part takes its time to feel out its surrounding its psychedelic flourishes held in restraint until its mesmerizing intro grips your heels fit for any journey in need of sound bent at forward pitch to alter the steady blacktop and guardrail lull included for the digital release is eulbergs mix of the title cut where he filters quiet caf noises the chattering of china and silverware into a more subdued liquidized version of the original its little more than novelty act though a sanding-down of the near-crazed frenzy that makes the original so appealing ut overall its traums second release of the year another eulberg nanda no less and if you can forgive the bunk-ass cover art youd do well to find it a warm winter stereo home
under his own name and as 61 players and west yorkshire-based producer joe lucas has made music for the last 15 years his experienced hand is evident on s second release a collection of spacious and occasionally spiky house cuts that show some stylistic overlap with trevino a long-time friend of lucas and founder of the synths on simmer low in the mix affording the tracks powdery drums and scissoring hi-hats plenty of space the groove is restrained and sombre making it feel a little undercooked pursues this vibe for the remainder of the ep to better effect: by bulking up the drums and putting some colour into the synths is more successful and lo sar are good tracks but the ep as a whole is stymied by its narrow range of sounds has ideas to spare but he could do with having more tools at his disposal
to describe as new breed would completely disagreed regard his contributions to the dance music scene for the past 14+ years however to call him a member of the nu breed would be quite literally a fact following such fellow globetrotters as anthony pappa danny howells and lee burridge tomiie steps to the plate for the latest installment of s nu breed series the feeling that comes to mind upon first listen is that of diversity beginning with the minimal ambient sounds of stephane k s numb and continuing into the new york underground feel of dj nukem s music play it s evident from the very beginning that the listener is going on a whirlwind tour of dance music with many genres destined for a stop-off those who are hoping for something similar to the of the 80 s and 90 s might be a bit disappointed with the double cd set other than hints of the old days here and there tomiie s mix is on the progressive tip which is really all that one can expect from a man determined to keep things moving forward instead of living in the past the first disc continues through the sander kleinenberg remix of lexicon avenues favorite from dusk til dawn and ends with what tomiie himself describes as a new school vocal record kings of tomorrow s i want you (for myself) disc two clearly starts at one end of the spectrum and takes the listener on a fantastic voyage that sees tomiie fusing break beat with progressive techno with uplifting house beginning with graffik s lesser man (a collaboration of satoshi tarantella and redanka) the track is meshes the dark sounds of progressive while offering a glance of hope as the synth lines break onto the horizon this leads into echomen s substance and from there on satoshi it s a smooth ride toward peak-time things get dirty as the quake of the low end specialists remix of fierce ruling diva s you gotta believe takes over from there luke fair s let you know batters the low end with its rolling bass line as that track gives way to hybrid s invisible noise it becomes obvious that tomiie isn t messing around once the signature break beat of hybrid kicks in one can imagine a full chock room of sweaty dancers going absolutely nuts schmuel flash reiterates why some of the best productions at the moment are coming out of israel with his appropriately titled chillin moments max graham rounds things out with tell you and then it s time to take a shower if this mix doesn t leave you sweating nothing will seamless inventive and undeniably everything a mix album should be tomiie shows why those calling him old better watch their step tracklisting disc 1 01 stephane k - numb 02 dj nukem - music play 03 little green men - there are beats 04 blh3 feat 80 - marscarter 05 samsara - afterthought 06 lexicon avenue - dusk till dawn 07 moogroove - deuce 08 remark - so pure 09 kosheen - hungry 10 tijuana - groove is in the air 11 jf sebastian - burden 12 north atlantic - mindfilter 13 kot - i want you disc 2 01 graffik - lesser man 02 echomen - substance 03 medway sean cusick - grafitti 04 piliavin zimbardo - late night return 05 kats styles feat craig mitchell - youre my 06 fierce ruling diva - you gotta belive 07 luke fair - let you know 08 hybrid - visible noise 09 greed - strange world 10 jerry bonham - seventh seal 11 schmuel flash - chilling moment 12 max graham - tell you
former dissident honcho ndy lake told r s will lynch this past january that we could expect a 12-inch per month from his fledgling house imprint if hes running a touch behind well forgive him: three releases by the summer aint bad for any label and the latest from cambridge producer (and full disclosure occasional r contributor) has enough ambition for a handful of eps the driving fits the labels remit perfectly its crisp hi-hats pushing classic deep house chords over bumpy vocal samples its got a dirty groove with plenty of space for fancy footwork but i wonder if could have benefitted from throwing just a bit more grit into his squeaky-clean sounds eauford is a different animal altogether thirteen-and-a-half minutes long and far less expansive rhythmically than its counterpart s big -side takes things to a decidedly techno place (though more of the sort practiced by john daly in his early days than what youd hear at erghain) mysterious and pitch-black its rare flashes of color really snap the dance into focus more than proving the worth of its extended runtime
s new label the aptly named seems to take deep house to a logical conclusion iry to the point of fluffiness the imprints two releases are so ethereal that they almost descend into pottery arn sampler soundtrack territory lmost zap the producer behind both gives the tunes enough bite to remind you that there is dancing to be done (or at the very least can be done) while they play cant stops mid-track at the exact moment that it threatens to fade into oblivion and pushes forward content in the knowledge that youre back in its clutches hovers elegantly its melody a holding pattern that allows for the drum pattern to find new ways to punch you with a velvet glove like its predecessor it seems to be a natural aural accompaniment to dark red mugs of tea and doing the new york times sunday crossword its wispy stuff but zaps passion for this part of the evening is one that is entirely unique in a field dominated by those eager to prove they can play harder and faster than their contemporaries this should be celebrated
im not one to pay much heed to press releases but the one for seth troxlers new ep certainly made me sit up straighter than normal recording under his moniker and described as the sound of doing unspeakable and anonymous things to girls in dark rooms i approached the three-tracker with an agreeable warmth engulfing my loins and the anticipation of some fairly intense auditory stimulation troxler boasts that he was placed on earth as a weeping foetus forged by crystal embers bursting forth from satans rear end and proclaims much of his talent as a direct result of this irreverent birth the validity of this debauched claim is yet to be proved or disproved for that matter but what is (on the evidence of this ep) undisputed is that the music he produces is not so much laced in depravity red lace and black leather as it is utterly saturated with it take the first track : from the fairly innocent beginnings of a slightly off-key organ a twisted strained vocal maniacally spits a warning t watch your back and were off into the depths a synth hook reminiscent of something michael jackson might have spewed back in his better days forms the prickly backbone about which the flesh and bones of the track resolutely assemble themselves the vocal continues to demand and threaten while halfway through the track a single creepy pad delivers the track firmly into darkness and thats before the twisted organ keys return for a final pounding from a demented clown the brief follows a faux disc jockey telling us whats in store for us if we wish to continue this dissolute journey into troxlers demonic mind before we get to the second track proper suggestively titled (a tribute to although im certain that troxler would reel in horror at the use of such a word this is much more conventional techno like a raptor laying waste to a collection of scuttling insects a pounding and exceptionally rounded kick drum interrupts a creeping clicking intro with the rest of the percussive elements falling neatly into the fissures it creates lush golden pads tripping hi-hats a variety of urgent incomprehensible vocals; this is intense stuff with the hook of the track an acid synth line bubbling just under the surface for the majority of the time breaking through intermittently with a ferocity appropriate to the menacing nature of the whole affair follow the analogy of the eps title think of as the moment foreplay turns into something a little more serious and as the eruption of one of the most powerful orgasms of your life (if youre into that kind of thing of course )

in its first two editions pinchs tectonic plates series showed just how much potential dubstep had for expansion and experimentation last years third installment uneasily balanced traditionalism and more daring fare as if the label couldnt quite decide where it wanted to go next volume 4 arrives only a year later instead of the usual three and while it exhibits the same vacillation between the old fashioned and the new its coming from an altogether more confident place lets you know youre not in for a survey of newer trends: the digital snares are like something from a 2006 skream record hearing the classic style synth that comes next ( ) you might think pinch was on a retro dubstep tear but then we get two tracks from promising newcomer and both of which sound like house jacked way way up the 138 bpm switches between a fleet footed gallop and heart in mouth bouts of freefall together with slamming slugs pastiche its nearly enough to forget that history lesson at the beginning with a few exceptions manages to blend dubstep and its nameless offspring into one coherent sound driven by swing and low end largesse it bears a comparison to keysounds new wave of producers but here theyre united more by a nebulous but clearly evident stylistic thread than a single tempo s decorates dubstep with kitchen sink flair and blasts it with blinding synths somehow it sits perfectly next to 122 bpm writher itself an exciting variation on their dead of night sound compilations back half gathers some lesser knowns all of whom put forth ideas that are definitely interesting if not as distinctive as the first half from the sensual sludge groove of groooves to s punishing everyone has something to say about the state of bass music corker is a seven minute beast from who drops another slow mo stunner full of rolling hand percussion and earthquake kicks crown jewel of keysounds roster and an equally important part of the ever morphing tectonic family s contribution ends the compilation on a high note one that says that dubstep can still be every bit as exciting as it was back when the first tectonic plates rolled around
black drift s contribution to the debut release was his first new material since the 2012 album steam days fake promised new textures on the label he co-launched with fellow border community signee wesley matsell and he delivered this extended ep gives us a better sense of how fake has developed in the past couple of years one notable difference seems to be his tools: feels less manicured than much of his output and live-sounding in the erratic way it unfolds (this might also account for a slight dip in sound quality in places the compression simply grips too hard) mostly however the ep represents a shift in focus rather than a total recalibration those fantastically baroque idm melodies have been toned down and the percussion given centre stage that said theres no shortage of tunes here if you know where to look the title tracks snarling bassline is brought to heel by trademark-fake ivory-tickling and while theres a loping funk to the beat of its quickly sidelined by the chords that melt mouth-wateringly onto the tracks surface elsewhere fake finds strength in dance floor focus is a superlative slice of kosmische electro; the closest we get to a melody is a humble acid line coiling in the middle distance (the tracks expansive vibe is reprised to lesser effect on ) even better is a twitchy drum track echoing the rugged funk of early perlon at first its beat coaxed from an assortment of minuscule bleeps and whirrs feels far too angular to work but before long it proves irresistible only in the breakdown does a single cooling synth line waft into view and within moments its rushing back the way it came leaving us to sweat it out for the remainder

is neil mcdermott a dj and producer from newcastle who runs the label with his brother tames in the three records hes put out so far hes presented a subtle and left-leaning style of house aligning himself with artists like leif who gave us excellent last release mcdermott has said that his goal is simply to make tracks that djs he likes would play and on that front hes succeeded: ben ufo introduced many of us to when he included transfer on ra 500 more recently the hessle audio dj has been playing the from new ep which came out this summer on perhaps unusually for a new producer mcdermotts sound has become more conventional over time: where colours was full of irregular rhythms root pattern was mostly 4/4 save for the lurching and chaotic iced now with hes arrived at completely standard if nicely honed deep house all three tracks work from the same blueprint assembling punchy beats within dreamlike atmospheres the title track with its tight shuffle and druggy disembodied vocal sample has an air of perlon to it has the same sharp hi-hats and perfectly sculpted kicks but set to a linear techno groove goes for a more organic palette with woody toms and a sample of what sounds like an upright bass but it still strikes a similar chord to the other two all three are lush in the way weve come to expect from and no doubt supremely playable but as a whole they come off sounding a bit too straight lets hope the weirder personality of mcdermotts first records isnt gone for good
coming through follows s fine debut body issues which came out on opal tapes last year it features three dusty lo-fi tracks from the chicago-born brooklyn-based producer that are a little less melodic than the stuff on that record is all greyscale with the sort of repeated chords and raspy percussion that should be familiar to fans alongside what sounds like de-tuned vocal samples in mellow barely-there chord progressions are matched with raw frenetic drums the claps and snare hits come in flurries and the whole thing sounds like its been smoothed over to the point of submersion is the records highlight locking into an assertive but cozy groove with an elastic bassline and globs of acid the lick of courtesy of label stalwart jtc (aka tadd mullinix) completes the release upending the heads-down mood of the original its a cheerfully oddball cut thanks to its swaggering drums and a shimmering free-flowing melody
in the absence of any new material from the group in the bespectacled half of the chemical brothers satisfies himself with two frenetic party cuts leads out with a barrelling hi-nrg groove thats soon overwhelmed by the wum-wum of bass synths and the sort of squeaky acid twiddlings that would make even josh wink twitch it doesnt end there either as rowlands liberally dots the track with 8-bit synths and drum rolls over the top yes but all the better for it is less playful yet more acid is dropped while its primary feature is a wild electronic purr whose intensity is slowly cranked up to a screaming climax before falling back and starting all over again it finally detonates into an explosion of roaring bass and drilling alarm bell pulses this one has festival anthem stamped all over it
final release of an at times deliciously divisive was one of its best and one that most fans of the label should be able to agree on are louis digital and cim and this dense urgent four-track ep is the follow-up to multi ordinal tracking unit which originally came out in 1999 on their own counterattack label before being re-released by in 2012 if anything the four tracks here are even more rough and ready and they surge with the same blistering intensity and * were taken from the counterattack live cassette that was sent to martin mckay of the glasgow record store rubadub in 1999 both are punchy cacophonous attention-grabbers with the formers bounding drums looming large over an almost happy hardcore-ish vocal squeak features full-blooded screams as emergency-service tones and chaotic drums scatter in the background might just be the pick of the ep it eventually turns its brittle flurry of thwacking drums and guttural vocal loops into a humming bliss-out with the addition of vast pads that tower over the other ingredients without consuming them a comparatively abstract squelch of arrhythmic percussive uppercuts and simmering keys rounds out a riotous and essential release
first lady of beatdown continues her run of form for this her second ep of and her first for the quietly fascinating untitled after imprint akua marcelle grants production is luscious and deep in ways that contemporary deep house has no interest in approximating: furious washes of sound envelop just about everything including the achingly slow beat on grants voice swirls around in such a way that you can hardly understand her thats ok: this track is all about falling in love and reason (as we all know) often goes by the wayside when youre dealing with such matters things are just as deliriously strange on (youre the which sees grant playing with her voice in the same way that she did on first lady of beatdown ep looping twisting tilting in the same way that someone will repeat a word or a phrase until it loses its meaning grant loops im so sorry until all you hear is the grain of her voice and a malfunctioning synth its confusing as hell and it might not work on the dance floor but it sounds like nothing else around right now and that is very much a rarity

with unknown to the unknown danny wolfers has found his match oth entities press up records like its part of their daily routine; their process and product are equally reliable wolfers tracks for the label have been some of his most natural full of the evocative cosmic synths and thick textures associated with that alias immensity of cosmic space was one of wolfers best eps in a while and with he delivers a record nearly as good is regulation built from familiar elements rollicking drum loops musty organs and sci-fi synths in a familiar way fans of wolfers schtick will eat it right up and its hard to find fault in the music outside of predictability the flipside each starts out much the same until the bassline shudders and shakes asserting itself more violently than usual ditto to the way wolfers layers the synths like streamers curling around the track until its draped in dense oversaturated colour each is a reminder of how wolfers can build on sounds that could easily fall into clich and is another welcome entry into two dense and overwhelming discographies
when it comes to uwe zahn sits near the top of the heap he doesnt always get the credit he deserves and his nearly decade-long break probably didnt help (there were no records between 2004s lilies and 2013s ve palor ) unveiling a kinetic and knotty sound ve palor still had some of the gorgeous glacial drift of his classic material which vanishes almost entirely on this is zahns debut for andrea parkers touchin bass a label that tends to release breaks and electro and hes given them two of his hardest tracks with its spring-loaded drums arleenpeers immediately brings to mind oversteps -era autechre trying to grasp the rhythm is basically impossible and the melodies feel random theyre clear bright and jerky think someone accidentally striking a casio keyboard and eventually they fight past the web of percussion a passage that recalls the placid tides (zahns best album) is even more chaotic with a wall of sound that no chords could hope to break through convoluted and unforgiving is the most challenging material yet it could prove either tiresome or mind-bending depending on your taste for fiddly
low income quad is a diy cassette label from croatia the crew is into the fringes of electronic music from the lo fi to the subversive and the downright weird its all done on a budget too hence the name the dodgy pixilated graphics that accompany each release set a fitting tone since late 2015 low income quad has been curating compilations featuring artists like drvg cvltvre kareem machine woman steve summers octo octa pan daijing and seixlack alongside many less familiar names its sixth release is full of dark and aggy techno from bristol ( ) s o paulo ( ) and montreal (ura) s is lo fi subversive and weird in one which makes it a great introduction to the label there are lots of strange machine noises set to a furious marching pace to decipher sounds beaten up as though its shedding parts as it limps along the interminable thrum of uras three sums up low income quads ethos best while is a scraping basement acid track that would go down well at a squat party two tracks are winding machine jams with a greater emphasis on mood and atmosphere
sees ben watt and working together again for the first time in ages the result is a cover of the xx track of that name one that was originally slated to appear on a covers album of the mercury prize-winning londoners debut record (the project was eventually shelved) but while its catch-your-breath beautiful exhibiting the same sparse beauty of the original its the three dance floor-oriented reworkings of thorns own that will most grab the attention of ra readers first up thorns long-term producer and crack remixer in his own right re-edits last years visionquest remix of (do two remixes make an unremix ) the result is nine minutes of panoramic slow-burning twinkling downtempo house two more reworkings come courtesy of stalwart sheffield house producer charles the remix is an elegant chugging slice of linear deep house replete with tick-tock beats and daubs of mournful keys the airy dub drifts off into a cotton wool world of woozy percussion and minimal snatches of analogue keys thorns vocal now little more than a ghostly hint in places tumbling to the floor like autumn leaves

i ll be honest i ve never liked breaks i ve never found it interesting and because of my musical preferences to me it all sounds the same i didn t like it back in the early 80 s when spinning on your head to broken beats was a favourite pastime amongst the children of the excessive generation and i certainly didn t like it twenty years later when the same phenomenon swept the world again the music this time was slightly updated and the beats more halted nevertheless the children of the chemical generation were now too spinning on their heads some things never change or do they a funny thing happened to me one day not too long ago i received a promo in the mail nothing funny in that because i receive some every now and then but it was the contents of the package that surprised me as i held the cd in my hand i felt a sense of disappointment because it wasn t to my taste but i thought i better listen to it just in case and slipped it into my trusty discman worst case scenario if it grated my nerves i could easily turn it off well i didn t turn it off i listened to it from start to finish when the last beat of the last track had passed two things happened firstly my jaw dropped and secondly i fell out of my chair the cd i was listening to was raw as f**k by the freestylers never in a million years would i have thought that i would enjoy an album created by one of the breakbeat massive s favourites while i realise that the freestylers have been around since 1996 for obvious reasons i m not an expert where their music is concerned or of breaks in general for that matter i m not going to pretend to be one either therefore i can t compare this album with their previous releases i can only go by my instincts which tell me that this is a fantastic collection of tracks that shows a variety of musical influences and smacks of quality more importantly it is an album that can be easily enjoyed if you enjoy listening to quality music tracks such as boom blast raw as f**k and get a life are obviously breakbeat in style but they attracted my interest because of their underlying basslines there s a very dark quality to them which i wasn t quite expecting i guess it s not all about happy party breaks thankfully listening to the slammer punks and warrior charge made me think i was listening to the sounds of violence in some respect while at the same time running away from danger there s just a nasty urgency in the beat that makes you look over your shoulder there s nothing there but you just never know while i ve listened to this album so many times now that it s getting silly two tracks that i would love to hear out in a club are no replica with its dubby funky bass and right on with its more electro tinged bass absolute cracking tunes that would get any room jumping guess i ll be heading to a breaks party soon if there were one track that i thought lacked something it would have to be dogs and sledges for me it had a rather annoying sing song melody and i found myself skipping this track every time i listened to this album but that s not to say that someone else listening to it wouldn t appreciate it which leaves me to my three favourite tracks on raw as f**k the first single push up has already been featured on radio and on music channels but i still can t get enough of this tune it s thoroughly infectious and is a proper homage to the early 80 s pop electro sound without being ridiculously cheesy a definite rump shaker for me the hidden gems of this artist album can be found in losing you and the closing track too far the former has a wonderful d n b inspired beat but is more uplifting in nature because of the overlying melody it s the kind of track that will put a smile on your face every time you hear it on the other end of the spectrum the haunting too far is quite calm almost melancholic in feel its sweeping down tempo harmonies are not quite the style of music that i would have expected from the freestylers and it is this very reason those unexpected moments which made me enjoy this album so much production wise this is on par with the better artist albums i ve heard this year it s just the little things that you hear the little quirks and the samples which give each track something extra when vocals were used they were used resourcefully if it was the darker nastier tunes the male vocals were presented in such a way that you almost thought they were growling at you with the more melodic down tempo tracks using a female vocal brought on a soothing almost ethereal quality overall i found this to be not only satisfying to hear but more importantly completely dance worthy by and large the feel of this album revolved around breaks but there were touches of d n b and electro while never straying into stupidity each track was as diverse as the next therefore sounding original as such i now have a ridiculous need to listen to breaks and i completely blame the freestylers i rushed home that day because i couldn t wait to hear all these tunes on my home stereo that night i danced around my apartment like a deranged fool while raw as f**k was blaring through my speakers did they sound just as good nope better it s a funny thing when a stubborn person has to eat his or her own words i remember three years ago having a heated argument with a friend of mine who loves breaks he was trying to explain the finer points of the genre after exchanging a few insults i told him it would be a cold day in hell before i ever sat down to listen to let alone enjoyed anything that was of the breakbeat persuasion i pointed out that hell would freeze over before i ever found myself dancing to it brrrr it s been chilly lately much respect tracklisting: 1 music is music 2 boom blast 3 raw as f**k 4 get a life 5 the slammer 6 push up 7 punks 8 dogs and sledges 9 warrior charge 10 losing you 11 no replica 12 right on 13 too far
last time saw he was in full on party mode headlining the main stage at this years love nternational in croatia on july 4 he played hits like whitney houstons how will know rolandos knights jaguar and lan braxe fred falkes ( ntro) t was my final night at the festival so my weary legs and battered spirit were in need of some easy fun but was expecting something else n recent years ( k jack revill) has purposefully moved away from this style and towards something more refined previous two times d seen him both at c 10 in biza hed played loopy material more patiently not leaning so heavily on the classics have definitely been conscious in not ing that way because feel like its been done revill told hyponik recently grew out of it a bit and it got easy to do this shift in direction is reflected in revills latest mix an entry into the kicks series mixes have been important to his success: he doesnt release records so the online tweak holic and mastermix series as well as his fabriclive 57 have been a way to engage his fanbase away from the dance floor but so far theyve upheld the image of revill as a party starter someone who combines technical proficiency and fun diverse selections to devastating effect ( ir classics heavy tracklists made them a great choice for pre club sessions and house parties ) kicks however presents revill in a globetrotting who feels at home at panorama bar or c 10 this is evident from the tracklist where revills fabriclive c crammed 9 tracks into 7 minutes kicks features 4 in 79 re are a handful of well known cuts but theyre by headsy acts like and transitions are generally longer and more subtle and the overall mood is deeper at least by revills rampant standards lso roughly half the mix is made up of music from 014 or later which feels like a statement given that revill has made a career out of mining the past new tracks by and provide some of the mixs most exciting moments ( s into s is a particularly inspired blend) but revills newer selections largely dont match up to his older ones take the first six cuts things get off to a strong start with s trippy seamlessly unfurling into one of s most sought after new tunes s but the energy subsides across solid yet unexceptional tracks from the likes of and ts not until s 1990 chicago house bomb that the mix finds its feet again recapturing that mean funky vibe that is revills calling card midway through track 14 s ubelle (jacks its catchy synth line suddenly subsides making way for a one bar interlude of rave stabs and the sound of a storm cloud imploding over a breakbeat moments later that synth returns and youre left wondering if you imagined the whole thing ts the kind of what the fuck moment that defines great mixes and here it marks the start of a barnstorming finale save for s the rest of the mix is spotless proof of why on his day revill is such a powerful thumping tracks by the likes of mr and all feature programmed so well and blended together with such precision that each new record feels like a logical development revill finishes with what are arguably the mixs two best cuts: s (a slice of raw ravey techno that came out of etroit in 9 ) and s 18 b which wraps things up in a tender flare of bright dancing synths kicks isnt the best mix s ever done largely because his taste in new house and techno is less convincing than whats in his record collection at home re are however flashes of brilliance that confirm his status as one of the most skilful and thrilling s working today

its to both and s credit that latters refix of s ten year old tune still bangs so hard a year after it first surfaced its s second release for keysound and one that perfectly embodies the labels ongoing dialogue with the the last two decades of tough uk dance music from jungle to grime and funky playing on the tension between nostalgia and hyper modernity this remix follows a formula similar to the one that made his debut commotion so singular: sharply individuated parts swells of potent sub bass and crunchy synth stabs pitches the staccato string earworm of the original down to a lonely figure accompanied by snatches of s voice so truncated they become rhythmic markers in their own right the simplicity of darbys approach makes for a powerful end result while his remix is obviously the main draw the b side is one of s most refined tunes so far its swaggering groove and crystalline rapid fire percussion sound like the skeleton of grime picked clean auguring well for s forthcoming debut album
the debut release of s project which features quivering vocals from elbows doesnt stray too far from the depressing palette of recent massive ttack albums isnt just music to listen to on rainy days: it actually sounds responsible for generating thunderstorms del naja is adept at wringing movement from minimalism the original zeroes in on a single corrosive scrape that bruises s falsetto the fluttering vocal and clanking percussion coexist as predator and prey although its difficult to decide which is which hotflushs ndrews provides a remix but its gloom sterilizes the menacing fidgety energy of gathering troops that the original conjures lurking leviathan is implied but the creature never raises its head above the seasick bass line
donato dozzy well renowned for his talent with the deeper end of techno and fellow italian dj say whose self-proclaimed style is electronic ritual dance team up here for the first time since 2006 and the electro-tinged darkness of polarity on mental groove this ep is a smoother dozzy-esque affair delivering textured hypnotic and high-quality ambient techno the premise is set out in the first few seconds of sub bass throbs hi-hats crackle and a pad builds suspended in religious penitence before the kick comes in offset by half a beat against the waves that have built up lone monk chants something indecipherable in quiet warning and more and more elements build on top of each other its constantly evolving ebbing and flowing with both ambience and constant pointillistic punctuation in the form of crisp high treble percussion and soft submerged zap fx is more immediate with more above ground not that far above though lien helicopter effects circle echoing and whirring as a churning beat rolls throughout harmonies are included more overtly as a pad gives the closest thing here to a chord sequence gazing out emotively with far sight the same progressive evolution and thick liquidity carries it through without being jarred by sharp changes two excellent tracks to soothe and escape with
if this exciting first release on is a sign of whats to come then the leeds label will be worth keeping tabs on behind it is a young producer named oflynn who first caught the attention with 2013s menacing bass-driven mantle on / desmonds he channels frican influences into two very different but equally impressive cuts is almost solely a drum track but its far more hospitable than you might think from that description staple in four tets sets for months now its star feature is the jaunty sound of the latin merican timbale drum which flits excitedly in the foreground as thumping kicks whistles and the odd echoing voice form an intoxicating backing desmonds could easily be something from a highlife world series release with a gentle chant and an addictive accordion riff evoking the sort of humid jam-session vibe that untie flo and esa are so adept at
t this point you cant help but want to have a new release on the shelves just to see what ridiculous title hes going to lend to his deep house/techno hybrids woman is the devil (amen brother) six figures (its what he jokingly claims he makes from his hugely successful tracks) invisible itchslap (hes not a misogynist trust) and now ear on the other hand though youve also got early reflections 1000 miles from home and now all tunes that more accurately reflect the moody dubby delays that seem to be the cornerstone of his work over the past few years this duality is the secret to vincents work i think a determined musician that has had enough tragedy in his life to know not to take it too seriously ecause despite the hardness with which he produces and djs vincents tracks are leavened with a melodic touch that give it a different resonance than say the erghain/ostgut axis that he is so often compared to ear for instance melts that age-old house chord progression into the mist of asic channel-esque dub delay and for just a brief moment a voice emerges to wordlessly utter something i dont even if youre not sure exactly what it is comes first though and its the stunner of the duo knocking together floppy metal synths a ships malfunctioning fog horn and a beat you might call hard house if that term didnt have such terrible connotations its somehow a song that you play at peak-time and one that you play to slowly slide out of that mode as well due to its generous outro ut thats vincent in a nutshell at the moment at least a man whose productions cant quite be called anything except music its a rare and special place to be
unleashes his first ever release on steve lawler s imprint this is the start of hopefully a promising career in production for pj after his dj career which has already seen him play in clubs around england as well as spain on the a-side is a track that has quite a nice solid flow throughout helped by a strong kick drum as well as a multitude of sounds and synth effects it has a bit of a melodic vibe throughout too with sweeping synths as well as a melodic piano line deep in do u wanna is the chunkier of the two tracks with a very solid baseline used throughout as well as retro sounds and effects this i must say is definitely the highlight side of the release with the groove created by the sounds and low end rumbles combining to great effect quite a good release it must be said here on with the very funky do u wanna providing the great highlight
fter a run of storming techno-laced eps it seemed that belgian duo had mellowed heading into ir output this year first for mindset and then dirtybird showcased a deeper sound with impenetrable clouds of reverb and woodblock snares replacing the swagger of their earlier work both eps were adept showing that could do polished deep house as adroitly as jagged bass music but its a relief to find them once again embracing something with a rustier edge for their return to saigon shift is starkest on where a bassline as rough as sandpaper scrapes and scratches around loping breakbeats in a way reminiscent of bassbin twins dogs by comparison is positively gilt-edged its heavily filtered stabs swirl around a vocal imploring us to pump up the volume and its lithe bassline bumps and grinds sinuously de vue continues in the vein of their recent work with pads enveloping choked sub thumps and percussive chatter s for the tired bass womp of digital-only closer well its a good job you dont have to purchase the whole ep these days
marcel dettmann has become an essential artist over the past year or two with plenty of excellent releases on ostgut-ton and remixes for various other labels his morose german techno has grabbed him plenty of attention and all the while hes launched his own record label as people in the uk and ireland say when something is devoid of pretention (courtesy of an ingenious ad campaign by a hardware product ronseal) does exactly what it says on the tin except in this case it probably doesnt even say anything on the tin or come in a tin its improbable then that the third release on dettmanns label is by somebody with the fruity moniker improbable but true regardless the music is impenetrably deep and serious this is a fine release of heavily dubbed techno that is just begging to be played in dark faintly dangerous rooms with the lights turned out the ep consists of a short intro track that verges on dubstep and two longer techno cuts the first 3 0 is built around a bass drum thats stretched out and submerged until it sounds like a looped howl of wind sinister chords perforate the gusts as a few cursory hi-hats and percussion elements break the tremendous gloom but not too much next up is 8 0 which is quicker and more overtly peaktime than 3 0 again the bass is cavernously deep and again the track sounds like the elements harnessed into musical form with wispy effects in the high end and wind rattled melody lines this is techno at an extremely pure level with no influences getting in or out once you can accept that its a really excellent ep

the seo-averse has followed a frustratingly choppy release schedule to date there was his initial run of form back in 2009/10 where he established his extraordinarily poised playful style by riffing on dubsteps 140 pm framework then after a silence a clutch of productions in 2012 which explored more house-friendly terrain whether it was luscious broken beats ( r e j it ) or a skewed disco edit ( m ) ll were great but it felt like s sound singular as it was merited more thorough exposition we may in the coming months be in for just that: the low-key london producer left his day job to focus on music earlier this year and this single for is the first fruit of his recent labours is the chief attraction its crisp itchy beat peppered with sample-detritus is instantly recognisable as s as is the bassline prim and proper but sporting a slightly coarse triplet turnaround whats new is the textures lays over the top: clotted drone loops at the opening growing into lush enveloping strings before falling away to a ring-modulated snarl somewhere along the line a kick trots into frame but the whole thing follows such a seamless through-line that youd be forgiven for missing it usy blustering along at 135 pm adheres to a more characteristic arrangement its the more refined cousin perhaps of fellow hemlock affiliate randomers 2012 output though the farty re-pitched horns in the latter half hint at playground humour behind the bookish facade

is one of those rare breed of producers who can turn his hand to almost any style and still find his sound in the past six years he has released downbeat hip hop drum bass left-field electronica and techno under a variety of guises over the last few years under his own name he has been delving deeper and more exclusively into house and techno though his sound seems to be constantly referencing and taking into account the breadth of his past explorations such is meteos latest ep on his own imprint a three tracker thats brimming with disparate ideas title track is a simple lesson in wringing out as much feeling from as few sounds as possible electronic music can be needlessly overworked and intricate these days with all the available technology but meteo keeps it simple with well-structured loops the main melody a modest pulsing pop progression that pans as it gently mutates atop the raw 4/4 drum track n austere acidic synth splatters highlights here and there whilst the overall sound is rounded out by clipped sound fragments firing off insistently begins life as an atmospheric almost beatless track reminiscent of some early dan curtin or morgan geist interludes its stringed instrument (probably not an actual guitar) plucks out a pleasing arrangement as pads softly accompany before a change of tack piano now leads the orchestration as the kick drums enter the fray more earnestly bass hits are lilting sine waves that help maintain the air of abstraction likewise never quite makes it with both feet on to the dance floor its broken off-kilter drums for the most part hidden beneath a stifling filter nagging looped melody that would otherwise be well nagging is set in context by a deep dub bassline that ties in the disparate elements of the track se three tracks are engaging in a decidedly slow burning fashion and all the better for it
another bangin release on one of my favourite labels first off the a side is an up tempo electro acid frenzy and finely polished drums using clever and effective use of acid filters and sounds a great track to keep that groove going during a set this flip is the refreshing latina mix by nectarios with if you havent guessed yet a distinctive deep and groovy south american feel to it a great ep for when your playing to either an electro or funky kind of set a tune you need to check out
the first release on the imprint comes from the duo of frank prosnik and jason timothy known as their first release on this new imprint is and it comes armed with a mike hiratzka remix the original is a pretty intense piece of work flowing with some interesting drum patterns as well as some pretty smooth basslines the track flows pretty smoothly throughout and has some great little touches like some drum interludes as well as some acid like riffs that subtly fit into the piece especially in the main breakdown deep into the track mike hiratzkas chunked up mix as the name suggest really adds a chunky touch to the release with some very solid basslines as well as some upbeat drum patterns and smooth effects a late in the track it featured on hernan cattaneo s renaissance mix from a little while back and you can see why this would attract some attention it adds to an already solid package thanks to the quirky a-side

martin skogehall and thomas jaldermark aka say patterns paths is an attempt to evoke the dark mystery of the ocean hearing the album you may find that surprising where fellow submariners drexciya made obviously aqueous music these swedes have a style thats far more urban but for a brief interlude of seagull noise at the start of their bass-heavy techno brings to mind not the sea but the mean streets paranoia of early-90s uk hardcore a slovenly snarling mix of siren synths icy stabs doom-laden voices and excitable reggae mcs patterns paths falls somewhere between the concrete feel of marcel dettmann the degraded crunch of l i e s and boddikas spikier output most of it would slip easily into the darker recesses of a ben ufo set if on first listen patterns paths seems intimidating persist promised an album of diverse moods and within the fairly narrow confines of their sound they deliver is dub techno that trades in high-density hypnosis its grimy textures and tribal percussion gilded with a lovely rising melody thats a far cry from the loopy mania of the industrial disco of or the kerridge-like noise manipulation of for all their rugged charisma there is a nagging sense that fisherman are riffing on modish styles of corroded house and techno without quite minting anything thats distinctively their own fully that will come but in the meantime this is a bracing debut

rene pawlowitz breaks cover for the first time since his album last year for with two more breakbeat techno missiles in the past others have theorized about why productions are so effective but the essence surely is that they tap into the serious dance music fans nostalgic side without resorting to clich it also helps that they are often satisfyingly simple and easy to engage with take for example throbbing organ stabs hissing percussion concrete block kicks and thats about it res a more overtly ravey swing to which rides a breakbeat straight out of the uk hardcore manual and a blitz of frantic old school synths does it break new ground hardly but who can blame when hes dropping devastating weapons like these with such mastery
continuing a streak of anything-goes releases for his own label s latest 12-inch features two versions of that land between house and electro listening to both sides it seems that the raucous bloops and squelches at the core of each track came first and the londoner then matched them with a couple different beats the approach is at its simplest on the vector mix as the beat is often little more than a 4/4 kick and a skipping hi-hat set to the synth sequence lack of rhythmic interplay and distinct structure makes the arrangement sound aimless despite the energy behind its ms-20 noodling the volt mix is a big booming electro groover that seems to have put far more love into it picks up where cortisol left off last year dealing with an elastic backbeat and hints of classic sci-fi with some serious editing the original drawn-out synth recording becomes a treat as it sets up a drop or runs circles in double-time around the massive beat the sampled shouts percussion and chords lend volt mix an old breaker vibe la l-naafiysh and clear but its all too unhinged to sound derivative even the scratching and well-timed rewinds sneaks into the mix feel fresh in context the fun he had with this track is contagious
as one half of uk production duo homepark has already cemented a rep for juicy organic deep house his second solo escapade after a debut for manmakemusic earlier this year offers a little bit of everything thats sometimes a euphemism for muddled but not in the case of upstairs for thinking downstairs for dancing is fluid springy techno with a granulated bassline that falls away like a ball bouncing downstairs dials the bass back to something more linear and portentous on with wood blocks itchy snares and squelchy handclaps its a case of light and shade on with the gentle synth hum softening the edges of the accompanying thick-set kicks theres something of a uk garage tinge to the snares too and then as if to underline s versatility in thick red ink heads into basic channel-style dub techno territory he pulls it off with aplomb beats dripping like candle wax bassline morphing from a regular thump to something more intricate and back again it only adds further lustre to an impressive ep

is something of a landmark for the recent not-quite-dance renaissance bringing together two generations of techno saboteurs chicagoan veteran hieroglyphic being and 100 silk-affiliated upstart ital first collaborated on a live performance at last years unsound festival; here they unite under the suitably cosmic moniker a 13-minute astral dub techno number dominates the ep but is actually the least interesting thing here which isnt to say there isnt merit in its improvisatory dynamics finicky clouds of psychedelic texturing and occasional descents into live-jam chaos; its certainly proof that the duos aesthetics can be blended into a convincing whole but its measured almost cautious tone is a tad disappointing we might reasonably have hoped for something approaching the brash intensity that both artists have explored in their solo work the title track displays mosss fingerprints more clearly the parched synths could be lifted from his toolbox and the sinister monologue he delivers is clearly inspired by his love for nyc post-punk is an unsettling drone piece all pinprick hi-end and gut-quaking sub both artists favour quantity-over-quality in their solo output and feels similarly rattled-off fortunately as usual there are enough flashes of brilliance to justify the endeavour
continue their run of ethereal instrumental beats with the latest mutation from british dj/producer the young producer builds on his previous releases for apollo with a rounded showcase of crisp low-slung beats dreamy melodies playfulness from a soft ongoing chime opening track swings into a mellow head nod tempo takes the blend of edginess soothing melodies to another level a crisp beatless intro rollicks into life with a hi-hat snare roll more typical of modern trap picks up from but with a straighter delivery of beats vocal samples heres takes a different slant with childlike chimes a dreamy melody that weaves in out metorite a collaboration with sorrow is all crunchy beats playful beeps vocal snippets is not dissimilar to kidsukes recent release the ep closes out with two contemplative tracks with a more serious outlook than the previous playful workouts
praveen sharma who is one half of sepalcure along travis stewart has until now channeled his solo output as through rush hour and hotflush ep is his first release for hypercolours sister label glasstable its title track layers deep rave stabs over a thickset bassline introduction of a jazzy organ loop slightly detracts from the initial hook but on the whole its among the new yorkers most notable solo offerings to date me u follows with less success blending sugared female vocals and an overly poignant spoken word passage alongside a tinny backdrop of neo-soul eps early promise is restored on b-side but the jacking depth soon amasses unnecessary acid lines and additional percussion giving things a cluttered feel is closer aligned to sepalcures early output placing ethereal ambience around feather-light pads and knocking woodblocks

mainz-born watergate resident k b lent g rler is a quality and quantity kind of producer self-imposed five-day working week has yielded around 40 singles/eps and two albums since 2007 and while i cant claim to have heard them all ive also never heard any serious missteps everything on this latest release is a collaboration with two of the tracks produced with his longtime studio partner hohberg and one with c vogt who the press sheet hails as s latest prot g unsurprisingly (by and hohberg) has a druggy feel freeform confluence of squalling synths jazzy percussion and spacey effects its captivating for its full 12 minutes the second hohberg co-production has an even more intoxicating quality imed in contrast to its predecessor at the dance floor its groaning chasm of bass is a statement of intent the addition of oscillating keys and steady percussion winds up sounding (in a good way) like something fairmont might have recorded before he started singing quite so much with its relentless night-train bassline and clanking effects by and c vogt is a close cousin to that ends up alighting on more oppressive claustrophobic territory n tmo trip version of closes the digital version of the ep its shimmering ambience adds another dimension to a package that pulses with ideas

conjuring up the kind of unbridled joy usually associated with the first day of a vacation or an unhealthy intake of narcotics has provided the ultimate cure for any random bouts of depression with his latest track his first single since his departure from sunday best its based on sedgleys trademark happy-go-lucky breaks programming and points itself almost towards a pop market although ostensibly commercial especially with the (unaccredited) vocalist making such a significant impact on the track theres enough quality in the production to make it more than worthy of ones attention its a bit like some of the less noisy bits of basement jaxx juicy and bouncy without being instantly disposable or overly sweet it doesnt quite hit the levels of the superb devil inside from half a decade ago but youll probably be happily signing along to the chorus by the end of the first listen on remix duties crazy slow it down a bit and focus more on twanging guitars and a slow build before the disco beat and big keys come in; its cooler but maybe not as catchy so horses for courses on that one the remix baton is then lobbed over to spirit who provide a forgettable house remix that pretty much completely loses the essence of what makes the original so brilliant more interestingly neighbour manage to keep the party vibe going with a squelchy-bassed electro breaks workout buy this for the original though and bask in its rainbow-like beam of happiness
the liverpool based unleash their latest release from red blue by the name of barry gilbey often production partner with anthony pappa does his thing on the flip the original is first up and it is a dark and driving progressive number tribal like drums build the track alongside some heavy low end rumbles the main dark stabbing effect soon comes into the track features heavily in the main breakdown and in the latter stages of the track when the heavy drums and effects all meet to take the track to its peak time conclusion the barry gilbey remix is quite impressive he adds a techy influence to the release with some deep rumbling baselines and some very tasty percussive work an electro melodic pattern comes into the track midway in and takes the track up another level creating a very tasty remix that probably outdoes the a-side
past releases on ware trapez and his own have proven jeremy p caulfield to be a real minimal contender combining bleep growl and pep in ample measure yet also showing restraint both sides of dry find him too restrained over-extended and bland cover art and titles hint at the summer ahead with caulfield lazing beneath palms mojito in hand rather than up the floors of ibiza against the rip kicks off with dub squeaks on the offbeat and a subdued kick fireflies dancing in the background hats and barely there pitter-patter congoes arrive early on a nice clap soon after and thus it shimmies for ten and a half pleasant minutes nude beach is the tougher of the two just with a less forgiving kick inside rhythmic knocks soon surrounded by clicks and hiss hats are busier but lighter clap underwhelming then in come those ubiquitous hollow rattles reverb and tweaking are the focus here and intricate programming and breakdown after breakdown make this the more entertaining but again once its found its stride it just sticks to it it could have been a trapez b-side three years ago and its nine minutes are overdoing it but its a nice enough ride both are equally inessential

like oasis his previous taster from his forthcoming escapements full-length s works a series of short melodic riffs minimalist in the classical sense over a simple but perpetually expanding rhythm track washed over with some big soaring week-long chords the results are akin to vintage detroit techno not only compositionally but in timbre and sound sources despite this its just alien enough to mark itself as clearly european; think black dog or 2 rather than rhythim is rhythim or model 500 in any case this is classy if fairly typical techno from the veteran croatian producer hearkening back to the days when the melodies did more work than the rhythms the track likely works well in the context of an album release but it simply isnt strong enough to stand alone as a single while dundov recruited european dub techno superstars substance vainqueur to remix oasis this time out he hands the flipside honors to american dub techno duo echospace to remix another album track while its difficult to judge a remix of a track that hasnt been heard yet echospace are in reliable form nonetheless running analog synths into any number of phased echoed and generally spaced-out modes over a deep punishing kick the intensity and complexity grows as the track moves forward and by the time the five-minute mark passes hitchell and modell have woven quite the sonic tapestry the kind with a pattern that makes you forget what day it is if you stare at it for too long smart money says that the b-side will see the top of your turntable far more often than the a
d f x s originally released in 1989 is an oddity any way you look at it collaboration between nigerian italian rapper dr felix and italian producer claudio donato it has the spiritual vigour and straight ahead throb of a classic chicago house track but the alarming synths frantic piano and dark energy bring to mind belgian new beat or the beginnings of hardcore the songs upbeat message peace love unity understanding various iterations of relax your body invocations of god and being one with the music doesnt match its grave delivery or the monochrome instrumental now the tracks been scooped up by the label to launch a series of archival releases accompanied by remixes from contemporary trailblazers beginning with ricardo remix is a head turning feature for any record t 19 minutes s version of is one of his more indulgent remixes stringing bits from the original over a squishy bed of electronics his squiggles and bleeps are instantly satisfying and even more galvanizing once the beat doubles up around five minutes in but there are also sections that drag diehard fans will probably love the remix for the same reason that fans of the original may hate it: its strange meandering and sounds nothing like its source material but since d f x s track hasnt lost any power 27 years after its release theres a little something for everyone on s reissue whether youre looking for a pristine copy of an old chestnut or a slice of madness

it doesnt come much more explicit than the title of s newest 12-inch is happy nd it s house juan it seems has ditched the paranoid androidisms of i robot and come out of the darkness with a house anthem worthy of the spotlight frequent df associate nancy whang provides vocals and maclean drafts in two former utomatons on keys and rhythm the live quality of this recording is key: not only does sound as present as many of the df s punk-funk productions but its also full of the niggly little overdubs and easter egg surprises that make this worth listening to just as much on headphones its proper place though is most obviously the floor and like its title implies itll be hard not to dance to it without a smile on your face especially when the insistent piano riff winds its way up through the mix prince s mix moves slowly from instrument to instrument highlighting just about every special thing about the original like many dubs the prince pitches up (and then down) the tracks piano riff to create some nice tension along the way t nine minutes and change the dub mix is more than three minutes shorter than the original jettisoning the epic reprise that launches whang into space on the rising talent lee properly remixes the tune into cosmic territory using the space portion of the track as its launching pad ll told three excellent playable tracks for sets of nearly any persuasion bring on the full-length
this split ep from glasgows bernadi and germanys feels like it could have been made any time over the past 15 years that sound like a diss far from it its house and techno with a classic feel s is a slo mo breakbeat/techno hybrid thats washed in syncopated synth trills t the midway point its gripped by waves of fuzzy bass s has a similarly plaintive mood its a wonderful piece of dark house with an organ swirling back and forth and gentle percussion pattering like summer rain like his opening track s balances frantic with placid with a jabbing hammond joined by offbeat crash cymbals guttural bass and a booming spoken word sample s mainly sticks out because its the most traditional sounding track here an unrelenting quasi hardcore assortment of whooshing synths and dubby breaks that closes out an ep of considerable merit
london-based producer aka ewan robertson has been quietly developing a name for himself in the realms of uk bass and experimental hip-hop with releases on labels such as stuff disboot and its something of a surprise that robertson hasnt entered into the conscious of tastemakers that he has enjoyed only a gradual increase in attention compared to some acts is perhaps more testament to his humble attentive and assured approach to production and commitment to his day job as a graphic designer than anything else after impressive live performances this year and an lp due to drop in early 2012 however that all seems set to change the second of three planned releases is an emphatic showcase of his finest productions yet theyre filled with emotive melodies minimal grime snap hip-hop bump and celtic swing is a good example of the last descriptor; a combination of raw layered effects are delicately sunk into a rolling wave of subby bass that builds with purpose until an almighty ravey arcade melody swings in triumphantly at the midway point strips back to an even more minimal structure a grime growler that snarls without settling for an obvious bite rattles at a similar tempo but its a song featuring cienfuegos where this ep gets really interesting the vocals manage to capture and enhance the sorrowful melodies snapping you out of your reverie and closing things out is a fat conductor of bass and snakey hi-hats that chugs back and forth like an assured steam engine
fter a frustratingly consistent album returns to the singles arena with a rare step outside of playhouse to the french environs of freak n chic the results are decidedly more ebullient with exhibiting an intensity in the bubbling lead and kick that was often lacking on care the vocalist is one of the major reasons for this: living breathing human offers up an immediate sense of forward momentum thats more than helped along by the percolating bits and pieces that eventually writhe away underneath the deep halting bassline off kilter in the best way possible dyed soundorom combs its hair puts a tie on it and scrubs behind its ears he also ups the tempo a bit and gives it a bounce that wasnt there before focusing his attention on the groove that tensed and teased in his original what style of djing of course will determine which mix is for you but i tend to find the original far more pleasing for home listening figuring out all of the little things going on is a treat if youre looking for which one to dance to while the sand runs through your toes though id break out dyed
things invariably turn deep suave and sophisticated when giles smith and martin dawson k king roc pair up as and their newest 12-inch is no different picked up by en watts refined label this concise package offers the pairs deep and cosy original alongside tobias more hectic subby club-driven remix furthering their string of impressive releases the london duo continue to fuse their earnest love for all things deep and housey with techno influences indeed smith a self-confessed obsessive house-head often talks about the influential role that chicago producers have played on his work however the man half responsible for londons popular summer outdoor parties secretsundaze has always set out to put some of the warmth back into the music the pair nail that quality with the track is steeped in t s trademark groovy vibe drifting with ease and a soulful sincerity from its casual beginning through to its contented end the records natural and effortless warmth seems to reach out of the speakers and touch the soul like wise words from caring elders understated but sublime the track revels in its own simplicity whilst showcasing its intelligence in an assured style the serenity of the original is paired up with the more agitated energetic remix from veteran german producer tobias freund the bass manages to conjure up a sense of restlessness well suited to dancefloor business philadelphias acid virtuoso josh wink sums it up on the tracks promo: tobias mix rolling groove so just as seamlessly as secretsundaze patched the uks long-standing passion for deep house together with the innovations in european techno so provide a soundtrack with the same sentiment with house in resurgence from erlin to ucharest their time is surely now
gets another diverse ep heavy on big tunes with s but as with many of the labels releases the most effective cuts arent the hardest ones s knack for slick sounds means the best tracks have an interesting flair that doesnt come from sheer intensity the highlights and are the eps most straightforward tracks but could easily do the most damage is the eps trippiest cut with delicate looped synths that create a mood thats disorienting and spooky is similarly stripped-down and also based on the repetition of a simple effects-laden synth claps and a shaker give it a sense of progression thats absent in the more idle the eps other tracks are in-your-face is the kind of a big room rave tune that ben klock founder needs most weekends these days it feels over the top compared to the classier and but djs with a big crowd in front of them will be happy to find it in their bag is an electro track with a broken beat and a searing-hot synth riff but will be harder to place than s more versatile options
logan sama (arguably grimes most prominent radio dj)s slow-to-start label earth616 releases new ep by ancient grime stalwarts j sweet and alias gasps are heard but no one is surprised the same could be said for the contents: the four tracks here (two solo two collaborations) stick steadfastly to grimes roots and yet still surprise call it blasphemy but id wager theres a little bit of dubstep bleeding in here you can hear it in the way the lfo basslines are just a little more prominent than they would have been otherwise and in the way they roll and commandeer the tunes but aside from that the duo provide four slabs of rudely clicking snares and gruff tones j sweets appropriates chintzy dirty south synth horns while alias is tougher arming its blustery strings and brass with serrated edges the collaborations are the big deal here and is a barnstormer: an unstable blend of melting vocal samples bristling mutant basslines and sections of snare-driven blitzing its the archetypal grime track dressed up in modern wob-wob clothes the duo also contribute a remix of spookys ubiquitous balling up the originals messy energy and batting the compressed fuzz between apocalyptic snares far removed from the other side of the instrumental grime revival the dayglo garb of butterz and terror danjah grimes oldest stalwarts show theres still plenty of stock left in throbbing greyscale minimalism
has weathered changes in the berlin house scene but his commitment to watergate and its glossy upmarket tech house has been steadfast however after being a staple of the mobilee roster for most of his career he turned to tsuba for quamarine which saw deep house influences finally creep their way into his productions years after he started including the likes of rick wade in his sets now hes breaking off with his own label named after scenario the parties hes been hosting at watergate and other venues around europe the guests kerri chandler djulz and melon to name a few reflect s turn from tech house to the deep stuff which the first 12-inch on this new imprint makes clear enough with its bouncy drums vinyl crackle and spacey spoken-word sample is an almost too-convincing kerri chandler impression though does it with feeling all loopy melody and plink-plonk percussion is like vintage given a deep house makeover once again the results are pleasing enough with an addictive chord sequence bubbling at the centre but the most telling part of the first scenario release might be the presence of connecticuts deepest ever deep dj he mashes up both tracks into a breezy remix that weaves in the best elements of each making the originals feel a little basic in the process but the appeal of has always been simplicity and reliability and thats what he delivers on his new label
the task of reviewing an anthology of music so virulently steeped in socio political context raises two problematic questions first: should a fair appraisal of artistic merit ever draw upon historical reference in order to justify present relevance econd: if it must can one ever hope to do so accurately without first hand experience of the juncture to which it is so inextricably linked a conclusive answer to either is elusive fortunate then that mandarinen tr ume should present enough of an aurally visceral experience in itself to avoid getting bogged down by such post structuralist digressions to disregard background circumstances in this particular case however would be to ignore a story of calamitous fascination the police state known ironically as the german democratic republic (gdr) held an iron fisted grip over most if not all aspects of its society like all other artistic endeavour music was subject to heavy regulation with draconian rules governing its production sale and reproduction throughout the country there was but one record label state controlled of course and only artists deemed worthy by the stiflingly oppressive government could obtain the licences required to release records and perform concerts legally radio stations and discotheques though few and far between were also strictly monitored lest they fall short of their obligation by law to deliver at least 60 gdr music at all times original thought and creativity were at a premium the fall of the wall and with it the gdr itself was still another nine years away when the west german electronic band tangerine dream were invited across the border to perform a seminal concert at the palace of the republic thus becoming the first pop group from the west in almost thirty years to do so uch a rare opportunity to be exposed to sounds that were free of state shackles inevitably attracted considerable attention and for those in attendance whose minds were still creatively astute enough it proved to be the beginning of a brave new electronic era; an era all but forgotten by the annals of music history yet one which thankfully provides the focus for this intriguing compilation from the increasingly multi faceted munich label a quick glance over the track titles hints at the vast scope invested here: planetary winds time machine olar rain galaxy one cant help but imagine the boundless reaches of a cosmos where walls and checkpoints have no place an ethereal flight of fancy which is embellished to grandiose effect by audacious composition take for instance s opening track w chst das nicht ber alles as this sprawling ten minute journey through an arpeggiated psychedelia of locomotive beats and synthetic haywire moves seamlessly into an epic soundscape of vangelis proportions it is hard not to feel somehow transported s ( time machine ) pushes the mental engagement even further: the hurried tick and chime of a clock beset the eerie stand off between bombastic bass and delicate guitar giving an impression of the dystopia from which this delorean is presumably fleeing its not all far fetched close encounters though while and provide the compilations more cosmic moments it is left to artists and to bring us back down to earth or at least thereabouts with more dance floor oriented numbers that flit unashamedly from the melodramatic to the dynamic as all good disco music should the pulsating moroder esque bass of tro for example is punctuated by interludes of serenely hammy female vocals and is as danceable as it is droll pecial mention ought also to be reserved for the gdrs most commercially successful electronic band whose three contributions here epitomise the rewarding naivety of mandarinen tr ume their track which sold an astonishing 100 000 copies upon release flaunts all the eccentric irreverence of escapism in a typically space gothic nutshell a country of impenetrable borders it is plain to see why this was so successful complete with era defining photos and engagingly extensive sleeve notes by groove magazine journalist florian ievers have delivered a poignant package that is indispensable for any electronic music aficionado whose interest spreads beyond the confines of the club this is not kraftwerk nor is it depeche mode there will be no place in the pantheon of influential achievement for the likes of or rather it is a music so blissfully unaware of anything bar its own mental transcendence that in a day and age of shallow commercialism and trend obsession is as reaffirming as it is self effacing
argentina has long been a hotspot for all sorts of techno producers a small but thriving club scene has a lot to do with that but its also down to not having a ton going on either fewer distractions means theres plenty of time to hunker down and get to work knows this well and has seen his work heralded by a number of labels over the past few years his latest a 12-inch for elgiums curle imprint is yet another solid entry into his catalogue is all metallic bounce glistening chords cutting through the irrepressible rhythm flinger meanwhile paints a darker picture its kick drum built expressly for cavernous clubs kopps built in what sound like gun shots and metal scraping metal at nine minutes its charm wears away quickly no matter how many bits of microscopic processing are going on underneath but itll likely serve as a perfect tool for the likes of dettmann and others like him finishes thing off offering hope and dub in equal measure (the wonderful melody in the tracks back half is a treat as well ) like its predecessors theres nothing new to be found ut kopps attention to detail makes this ep highly useful a testament to all the time he hasnt spent in clubs lately
keiran lomax has an open-minded approach to making music as befits a man who released drum bass on moving shadow before making the move into dubstep of late hes concentrated on styles along the 4/4 continuum and a return to finds on house and garage manoeuvres rather like he did on last years ep for aus on that means using the full breadth of uk garage tropes a bassline so wobbly it practically topples over spinbacks a spitting 2-step rhythm synth stabs and a vocal that rises from deep baritone to falsetto and back if that sounds too much like something from a 1998 todd edwards mix the rich rounded percussion firmly sets it in the now and is definitely where is at it wallows in the sort of luxuriant growling bassline favoured by huxley and maxxi undsystem finger-snapping beats and italo pianos feed the meaty bouncy rhythm with the track radiating a height-of-summer glow
blackdown aka esteemed journalist mart clark has always utilized a jumble of ideas and themes from urban sprawl to ethnography to the science of rhythm and the music he makes with his partner dusk is just as dense and overloaded with formation these are artists who saw (and chronicled) the spr g of dubstep and have often through curat g the keysound label helped to nudge it along to further adventurous places their debut lp marg s music was a stunn g portrait of londons darkest corners someth g that hybridized grime dubstep and garage their second lands a drastically different landscape and sees the group expand g their horizons beyond london dusk blackdown have an idiosyncratic grip on texture and structure which wholeheartedly emphasizes melodies are spired by the mischievous gr of classic grime tracks playful pann g is heard on the title track vocals are chopped to m uscule chord-like bits blaz g zed bias style their peculiar taste vocal samples only creases the albums circus-like atmosphere from the gruff exhortations of a t begg to the surpris g and familiarly funky gasps on dont here they take pages from the latter days of speed garage before dubstep had adopted its new moniker and sort of plays out as a parallel universe the same way that lhfs work on keysound h ted at pre-garage darkside drum bass these tracks have the aggressive little lfo revs and the coke-and-champagne bounce of turn-of-the-century uk pirate radio as well as the open-m dedness of two guys who have heard it all so you get the madden gly disorient g acrobat tricks of in alongside more traditional workouts like vibes all doused technicolour of the soundcloud-era explosion of bass music that palette is also the albums weakness though: no longer honed on their close-to-home urban jungle they occasionally sound out of their element nonetheless tracks like the rollick g where chipmunk vocals ride rattlesnake snares prove the duo still have the flair for drama that def ed their debut album and the albums opener a seven-m ute waft of cardamom and cense grounded by tense bass drops and s semi-spiritual moans ranks among their most rivet g moments tak g us from there through 11 tracks of twist g s ew and scrap metal is an adventure any way you look at it even if some junctures are less spir g than others the album ends with a no-bullshit garage workout where the snares break out to occasional rolls that sound like woodpeckers all sat atop an impossibly funky shackleton bassl e s one of the few moments on the album where they sound completely content with be g themselves emphasiz g the meat of their sound rather than the decorative garnish

s ongoing streak of prolificacy is almost frightening not for its voluminous output but for its superhuman consistency and unflagging quality with new releases coming from all angles its hard to trace the lineage of his latest the ep for the netherlands resident psychedelic grime specialist rwina despite falling between the equally excellent and career-redefining eight-track power grid ep on planet mu and the upcoming undeniable lp on hyperdub lacks the expensive sheen of those two efforts excuse the pun but you might say these three tracks are extra grimy toning down the hypercolour playfulness and rhythmic elasticity in favour of a decisive thrust frequent collaborator dok appears on the barebones wallop amplified by doks characteristic ha soundbite instead of terrors usual melodic tangents the synths are forced to seep out of the cracks and craters created by the punishing beats if is relatively unfriendly practically bears a keep out sign anchored by an ugly dissonant thump as the synths are again forced to worm their way out piecemeal of the ensuing destruction towering over the b-sides the title track is a lengthy six-minute trudge cycling through movements (dare i say prog-grime ) with a sort of begrudged alacrity; theres eager energy here but theres anger too a forcefully-descending riff splinters into atonal screeches and malfunctioning bass before catching a luxurious ride on nearby floating clouds airy noodling synths are quickly punctured by a nasty low-end falling back to earth with alarming velocity as the elements catch fire until the flaming wreck hits the surface and begins anew itd be folly to pick a best out of a career as unpredictable as danjahs especially at the rate with which he seems to one-up himself but theres no doubting that the striking stands near the very pinnacle of his career even if its attendant tracks seem simplistic by comparison considering its release date it will either get caught up in the wave of hype or swept under but no matter the result thisll be one you can dig out in a few years time and wow an audience with as either a rinsed-out anthem or long-lost deep cut
when we talk about big dance records its often a measure of emotional impact in case these emotions can feel conflicted the -side of lost scripts recent 10-inch for the labels edit series seemed to portray a wounded ego s o p s melody made your chest swell but the sour notes gave it an air of defeat the duo of john talabot and marc pi ol delve deeper into these moods on the record sleeve has a quote from philosopher smiths the felt meanings of the world : this world exists nonnecessarily improbably and causelessly it exists for absolutely no reason at all in the same way that smith goes on to explain what he considers unexplainable talabot and pi ol evoke the ambiguities that can make this sort of euphoric-yet-worn-down club music so compelling has been a mainstay of the hivern crews sets for some time and you can hear why the synths and bass soft and insistent stack onto the arpeggios in thin layers some of the sounds a mouth click a stringier synth give an earthy tone and those bits keep it from sounding too syrupy you could accuse of being overly sweet but it depends on your taste in vocals when given room to breathe the sultry r b singing sounds great but when loop the syllables for emphasis its like adding icing to an already finished cake
is turkish producer yunus guvenen who s release on bedrock records earlier this year had to rate as one of the finest release in the last year or so this time he makes an appearance on recordings with his with two new tracks to add to his impressive discography underwater is on the a-side and this is where the ep shines for me the track builds in the early stages with some impressive intricate drum patterns as well as some high-end sounds and effects that set the mood early on not before long yunus is working his magic yet again with unique melodic structures and a beautiful uplifting vibe the breakdown midway is a shining example of the beautiful sondscapes yunus in capable of with a stunning goosebump melody and lovely broken beats the track then lifts up another notch with the drums coming back into it in full force while the bubbly synths step up a level don t be fooled this is definitely one of yunus finer moments while take a breath of you on the flip may not be as impressive as underwater (in my opinion) it still is definitely a great production it is perhaps a little chunkier on the face but the melodic patterns early on have a mid 90 s progressive feel to them a feature that is magnified in the breakdown midway in further magnified by the addition of deep emotive strings who knows many will probably prefer this production to the a-side as it is another stellar piece of work by the turkish master if music with a strong edge of melody is right up your alley then i see no reason why this release shouldn t be added to your collection for fans of yunus invasion ep this is quite simply a must purchase
the name calls to mind powerviolence an extreme strain of hardcore punk which isnt far off from the sound of milo smees label everything on has been hard and direct especially smees own productions as dipping in and out of acid over his two releases so far the best bits have been when hes at his steel-toed-stomping hardest thats the route he takes on live* locked a fast-and-furious lp of live jams that get right to the point the drums on the record are mixed so loud they could have been sampled from a metal band a distinct thump that you feel right in your gut opens with brutally fast rhythms and a screeching melody that sounds like its being forced out most of the tracks are based on this formula of pounding percussion and simple melodic accents like the bleepy synths on unlike a lot of dance music where pads and chords are timed with the beat here they spurt and splatter seemingly at random its that live feeling again that being said comes about as close to traditional techno as ever has hurtling forward like a lost planetary assault systems demo cylinder bop arguably the records best tune sees him taking a more electro tack loading the tracky beat with frantic ur-style arpeggios though live* locked could have made for a blistering 7-minute workout pulls back for the records two closing tracks feels like a tossed-off hip-hop beat while lambience is just an uninspired limp to the finish line its usually commendable for an artist to bring in some variety like this but on live* locked falls short of the mark still five out of seven aint bad
nd just like that were back with kieran hebden this limited remix 12-inch coming hot on the heels of the original joy dubsteps man of the moment continues his upward trajectory with his lovely 130 pm take on the infectious techno track that once again cuts up the human voice into the melodic and sometimes rhythmic heart of the tune gets a rinse so does bits of love but its the lovely synths that undergird and overlay and window dress that raise this to another level roskas brand of dubstep meanwhile has been more ritualized and his remix sounds less immediately arresting nonetheless the producers slow and leering take on s source material works because of the usual bass magic the lead line here is fluid before breaking out into the sort of thing that makes you approximate with one hand the relative height of your dad then your mom and then your sister three times in quick succession while continuing to rotate your body in time to the beat oth tracks here dont scream anthem but theyll provide plenty of reasons to pull stupid dance moves like the aforementioned nd often enough thats what its all about
over the last couple of years has been a stalwart of the slow burning and its limited offshoot is typical of the sound he is developing an unobtrusive take on house with enough specific detail to keep things interesting to isnt the most arresting track but it has depth the fundamentals are simple: a mournful moan a melancholic swipe of strings a circular beat and an omniscient bell that eventually heralds a fuller sound theyre further developed in the digitaline remix which turns things tribal by toughening up the percussion the results are predictable but satisfactory it was just what the track needed has taut strings that rub shoulders with amorphous voices under which are placed brisk pads like the other two tracks its a disciplined sonic excursion hasnt offered a huge range here but his attention to detail is admirable: its a less-is-more approach that succeeds
and are both artists and labels whose fascination with disco predates that of most current producers and also takes a completely different form (aka erik and fiedel best known for donna a weird but brilliant electro style edit of donna summer from early this decade) and (best known as half of smith n hack) both like to chop tracks up into tiny pieces and then process and reassemble them into harder harsher forms albeit with a strong sense of humour that sense of humour is the defining characteristic of this release if you think that techno like the internet is serious business you need read no further s side is the harder of the two and is strongly reminiscent of early dj sneak on devil s a galloping two note sample is looped and stuttered teasingly before a galumphingly heavy kick drops in you constantly expect that he s going to release the full sample over the next phrase of the song but it never happens is apparently an unreleased track and is full on pranksterism with it s unspeakably jolly guitar loop creating a countrified knees up feel though god knows how he managed this because there s absolutely nothing country esque about the sample on the other side s and is completely ridiculous it s as if the pair have deliberately used all the corniest ideas possible and jammed them into one song re s a plonky metronomic bassline and farty sounding synthetic horns playing a tune that s halfway between a fairground and an exercise video and of course there s cowbell in the classic dunk dunk da dunk dunk pattern speaking personally i love small parties in small rooms where everybody s drunk including the dj and this track is perfect for those moments particularly when the brass hits on beat one give way to a eurodance organ playing the main riff is probably the winning jam on the ep however and is another one from the vaults according to the press release like donna this feels like disco source material twisted into electro shapes re s a roiling one bar bassline and acidic squelches and that s pretty much it but it s a stunningly effective groove and a true exercise in minimalism you ll need to be a great dj to bring out the best in this but these artists have always made challenging music and there s no reason to expect them to change now ten years on
there are enough dense rain-forest adventures coming out on cadenza and its ilk these days that there seems to be a kind of widespread werner herzog moment going on imagine luciano on the decks in room one at fabric with herzogs amazon fever dreams projecting on the walls: ethereal pan flutes and feverish drums swirling while fitzcarraldo drags a boat over a mountain and aguirre loses his mind on the terrible river or imagine ricardo as fitzcarraldo in a white suit on his quest to bring a temple of music to the jungle depths another standout in cadenzas recent salvo keeps the fire burning in the south american wilderness the tune unfolds in a cinematic expanse that crescendos in three parts it begins by building a lush bed of percussive flora including ominous rattlesnake shakers then elegantly withdrawing in order to introduce a mindlessly hypnotic pan flute riff under which the drums swell once more then in part three yes its another stirring tin folk-dance vocal a female lead with some gentlemen on backup painting the dream of some hot saturday night in a decadent cabana hidden deep in the forest in full swing the tunes an impassioned burner trippy and exciting and over the course of twelve minutes it doesnt lose an ounce of steam offering up more than one good lose-your-shit squall the flipside dub is equally solid showcasing dizzying drum layers adding an extra rolling bass gearshifting midway for a sudden flute loop burst if the soulful tin folk vocal has lost a bit of its novelty in the past year its only because its a good enough of an idea that it spawned a small legion of suit-followers so much the better perhaps the one complaint here is that you can tell the vocals a sample one reason stimmings una pena was such a face-melter last year was that the violetta parra vocal floated so beautifully unmolested atop the minimal house-groove you could be forgiven for not noting it an appropriation the singing on in contrast bears a bit of a time-stretch skidmark baring some of its digital artifice rgely a home-listening concern to be sure its a quality most likely indiscernible when jammed late night on the main floor
some disco thunder from down under: ussie sidwho releases his big catchy tune of the year on compatriot last time around the mans vote bowie for president found good traffic among the prinses terjes and sweeneys of the world this year sidwho stretches out on a breezy midtempo groover replete with an 80s white-funk heartbeat and infectious vocals slightly far-off oddball warble gives the group-sung chorus a goofy rthur-russell style warmth and underscores the incongruity of the question: have you paid for love tonight well arent you always paying for love in some way or another jamie s edit opens with this curious choral call and stretches out over 13 minutes paced so it moves like an extended workout snaking through instrumental bonk and additional vocal lines the tracks got that unique combination of hooky elements and spacious rhythms making it ideal to be grandly woven into the fabric of a mix first surfacing with a big chorus then disappearing under currents of rhythm only to bubble up again and again as the track shifts through its various gears the other two tracks here might induce a bit of customer confusion while the words zari remix might catch your eye their version hews close to the original muscling a bit more low end and adding some cosmetic flourish the distinction between this and the edit will mostly be noticeable if youre weighing them based on mixing potential s such its s other version here that does the heavy lifting swapping out sizzling funk-punk live drums for a percolating roland palette dont be surprised if you see more where that came from in months to come as the 303 squiggle continues to enjoy a bit of resurgence
fans have been waiting for some time for michael mayer to break his production silence and grace us with a shot of summer brilliance and sadly this collaboration with reinhard voigt isnt quite it not their first collaboration for and theyve appeared together on various total compilations - their fondness for one another was most touchingly displayed on voigts early love poem sex mit mayer transparenza opens sweetly enough with a trademark syncopated mayer bassline in a key both mournful and yearning as hollow pops reversed samples of rustling paper and smart kompakt percussion move things nicely forward reinhard unsubtly nudges in with a pair of duelling sirens and here it locks into a hardly euphoric though enjoyable groove where it chugs to its conclusion serving up both voigts pummelling crunch and mayers seduction lazily diluted switzerlands davidovitch meanwhile should have been served the rejection slip as cellophane is an unpleasant seven and a half minutes of nostalgic everybodys happy acid house based around a horrible static keyboard lick and filled with irritating breaks and whistles noticeably absent is the kompakt production gloss leaving this sounding dry flat and amateurish mayer/voigts contribution wont ruin anyones set but it wont enhance it by much either davidovitch meanwhile will have them guessing what old relic youve dug out - and why - rendering shock to all who view that sacred cologne crest
this new one-sider finds at a new crossroads hes taken the neo-rave thats rocketed him through the past year as far as he could: pineapple crush once in a while emerald fantasy tracks and echolocations is a hell of a run for anyone in such a short time recently he told me in november kind of out of nowhere i jammed out this really strange tropical thing with loads of percussion thats the shit im working on now lives up to that description perfectly led by a vivid dayglo synth riff so absurdly springy its like a slinky going berserk but it doesnt recall any older era the way s (and others) synths often have lately his neo-hardcore took pains to present its instrumentation as purely electronic but here hes gone organic that lead synth sounds both woody and cyborg and so does the percussion: woodblocks and skintight snares building steadily and rolling in tandem over a basic house pulse with itchy accents and subway-sweeper bass details keep coming to light over several plays; like all of his work it keeps opening up with time the biggest shock comes at precisely the third minute its a sample of a little girl saying i get it; i just go back past all those weird things again until im home thats it followed by some crunchy percussion the percussions source takes a second to peg: its from ultramarine off of emerald fantasy tracks that album was released all of six months before time flies when youre reinventing the past not to mention reinventing yourself
from the two dubstep-rooted rollers yesman and elevator that kicked off s eponymous series of self-releases the london veteran has polished his brand of funky floor-fodder with a string of anthemic tracks that have found their way onto many a mix 3 was probably his most succinct work of hybrid bass to date and with this in mind its successor is disappointing innocently approached is catchy enough built upon a solid 4/4 pulse and growling sub-synth the hypnotic vocals and ticking array of percussion quickly lure you into its zombie groove fine the first few times round but with repeated listening feels closer to brainwashing than bopping with following a similar suit while repetition forms a significant part of s signature up to this point it has been coupled with an element of surprise like more of you entering a breakdown that it then never rises from or the continual climb of elevator that has you wondering where youll finally end up there is no trace of build at all in 4 both tracks remain glued to a constant plateau that in the end turn his signature stamps into something increasingly wearisome even irritating

ive only seen butler perform once when she opened for laurel halo at trans-pecos in brooklyn and despite about a five-year gap in experience the two were a perfect fit butler a floridian ex-ballerina who now calls the bushwick neighborhood home seems to have a sort of spiritual connection to halo theyve both spent time in new york and came to electronic music from more classical formally-trained backgrounds unlike halo didnt make synth pop and ambient before arriving at techno but shes wound up in a very similar place on her debut ep carries the hallmarks of an artist with much more music to her name and a natural understanding of movement with five tracks s first release thoroughly carves out her own operating space she uses straightforward rhythmic figures that nonetheless feel loose and experimental the way prostitutes unabashedly clings to the grid comes to mind albeit tempered with say stellar om sources slyly alien sound design it doesnt always work: is a bit flat and overly frigid and the least exciting of the bunch despite the burly bassline that occasionally sneaks in to add some swagger tracks like (the big banger here) and however show just how good s approach can be she sets up their muscular unmovable foundations to give meaty basslines and percussion something to tease at and spin around it works well with pared-down arrangements too both and highlight pt rely on staunch beats and atonal whorls to get their subterranean grooves out the latter only using its slippery bass sequence to lure you underground before disappearing altogether whether its with that sonic sleight of hand or a rhythmic stunt wants to trick you its best one is making such rigid austerity sound so damn funky
do you know when you go well im going to go to uni and im gonna have this job n im gonna buy a house gonna meet a boy settle down i wish i could have followed that but i havent says an interview snippet on s third album its spoken matter-of-factly but the sadness is evident a reflection of the melancholy associated with the north of england economically beset region where bandmates idan whalley and james young hail from is the focus of ir earliest records were preoccupied with the dark corners of londons dubstep scene north was more introspective and news from nowhere recorded in yorkshire embodied a pastoral tradition of english pop for the pared-down duo made trips to huddersfield in yorkshire a sort of halfway point between where each of them grew up y met and spent time with residents whose perspectives form the backbone of s arresting portrayal of the area prominently features interviews with people around huddersfield (read more backstory in f der s making-of feature ) far from exploitation or class tourism the clips they include are respectful sometimes heartbreaking and other times hopeful saddest moment comes early on in which is a press release from the kirklees council website read aloud this account of funding issues and the drastic measures needed to get up to snuff is chilling and highlights how bureaucratic decisions affect the people and their communities though is tied to present day the conservatives re-election in may hangs over it directly inspiring two tracks its also a way for whalley and young to revisit their cultural and musical roots y seem to have learned from former vocalist james buttery how to write strong hooks and now wrap them in the stately loneliness that dates back to idys girl is computer occasionally they dress the music with ornate strings and the kind of chamber instrumentation heard on news from nowhere but now it all sounds more sad than uplifting has some of s best songs and the tones are varied considering the downcast subject matter a slice of peppy and orchestral electro-pop is the odd one out while the acid-tongued recalls slinky post-millennial r b in its mechanical herky-jerk with concise often poetic lyrics the duo address the grind of daily life in a society moving towards austerity ( ) and the plight of a new generation born into it ( ) sung through whalleys reedy high register the words are powerful but ephemeral at one moment his voice hovers above the electronics only to dissolve into them the next saving their boldest turn for last is the most overt reference to david camerons government written in the days following the general election its foreboding boots-on-the-ground march signals a bitter turn for the record and the north in general s with the rest of however theres still hope woven into the albums closing section s tale is neither damning nor particularly optimistic yve become powerful songwriters since they focused on the craft in 2010 and shows it off more than anything else its a loving fair and uncommon look at everyday life in places like huddersfield that are typically underrepresented or just completely ignored is preceded by the gorgeous lullaby javans which is a glimmer of positivity that casts a shadow over the closer the albums final interview clip the man (presumably javan) says i dont think id like to leave going against the notion that the north is somewhere to escape from just because of the people my friendship group my family i do think theres future here
delft artist - made waves back in 2011 with his planet mu album presents kentjesz beatsz whose dutch bubbling house style ravey syncopated strange caught ears attuned to uk funky kush in da sound is that albums iong-overdue follow-up in the intervening years - has entered his 20s but he doesnt seem to have lost any youthful energy he has however homed in on a particular aspect of his sound this time around the synths gloopy melodies wrought from crude trance presets arent pushed into such weird shapes and the drums stick to a sped-up dembow rhythm (like uk funky with its shoelaces tied together) s a result kush in da sound has fewer bewildering moments but its not without its thrills: whose synths are just a little more seasick is among his finest spiced up with kalimba-like melodies kush in da sound s other innovation is length previously opting for short sharp bursts of the bizarre - now makes his tracks longer equipping them with explosive intros and extended nauseating breakdowns (in case we were at risk of getting lost in there the occasional airhorn helps mark the way ) not every track merits the extensions but when they work its golden as on fack whose scrambled breakdown propels us to yet higher levels of rave delirium
hes a hard one to pin down that throughout 00s he was best known as a trickster some bastard spawn of gg allin andy kaufman and negativland who recorded wry antagonistic electronic music as v/vm alien porno midgets orious p i g and a passel of similarly skewed monikers (among his antics was a fake pole track that fatcat pressed up in good faith as stefan betkes legitimate work ) then in 2009 he seemed to have a change of heart with sadly the is no er what it was a sextuple lp / triple cd of some of saddest ambient this side of william basinski somewhere in between those poles of sacred and profane res the caretaker which offers a particularly british take on nostalgia via music he terms haunted ballroom and n res this apparently first in a new series of four 12-inch eps his label the title he attributes to a remark martin hannett made regarding tony wilsons factory theres an awful lot of incest that goes on intrigue and stuff but it may not illuminate much in truth it doesnt have to; music is a relatively straight ward affair dense with detuned syn sizers and creaky effects the opening is most surefooted and declarative thing here eight minutes long with heavily overdriven syn sizers glinting above a 100 bpm drum groove; it sounds a little like boards of canada thats been run through meat grinder (in a good way) the o r five tracks are more oblique their ragged analog sound seems intended to evoke a range of early syn sizer music from delia derbyshire to british electronic foundation an 80s band with ties to human league and heaven 17 but kirby never contents himself with pure electronic abstractions; his songwriting is grounded in much more conventionally musical ideas sounds a little like one of raymond scotts blippy childrens lullabies and is a fugue charred music boxes; storms sounds like a windham hill midi file thats been fed through a bank of junos recorded to tape and left in sun the most involving selections and are slow-moving chordscapes somewhere between brian eno oneohtrix point never and an ensemble of haunted bagpipes distorted to point where frequencies chafe and blister
return after their great release on bedrock breaks with the release of their hidden truth ep on the gravitation imprint first up is midnight on the metro a pure thumper 4/4 track from the word go good solid beats are joined by a nice deep baseline that drives the track throughout it is accompanied by some nice effects and mellow sounds creating quite a lovely track on the whole turn it over and you have the earth dueley remix of cloud harvester nice work here from dueley as he delivers a pretty smooth house record with a nice bouncy baseline intricate percussion and some nice warped out sounds and effects another pretty solid production from earth knot myself follows and sees unleash some more broken beats with a very smooth production very smooth much like their release on bedrock helped by nice deep baselines and smooth atmosphere not a bad release here from but for me it s a bit short of their release on bedrock breaks
if youre one of the many who think that growing up is best left to other people you mightve enjoyed s last year its glistening bell motif felt like a coloured mobile but with a laidback in white rooms shuffle on paper youd expect comfort from the three remixes lots of warm deepness and airy pads well-suited to the otherworldliness of a torchlit beach party ut what really heightens them is their introverted demeanour: they make you feel safe and open to possibilities josh s remix is led by a carefree deliciously psychedelic digitisation of the lead riff with just a whisper of the kick and some pattering congas it builds to a climax but then drops completely out at last though were given the kick coming in as if on a whim its dead smooth glitching the spasmodic carnival from dormant to grooving in a split second in dairmount eradis mix were given space to play in a familiar environment; its the most straightforward house here with cerulean washing and throwback rave stabs done solidly and with a subtle distinctness with ripperton weve made a den under the covers and weve got a torch a short melting acoustic bass loop and lucid synth tones: as is often the case with ripperton the musical ideas are simple but completely homogeneous with the richness and homely disposition of the sounds the literal english translation of glockenspiel is bells play its got those too

is a purveyor of stripped-back cybernetic electronics moving through minimal synth industrial ebm and cold wave sounds to form a dystopian human-meets-machine aesthetic (the visual design is worth a look as well ) the la-based artist has been at it for years but has just recently gotten busy with physical releases after a contribution to last years humongous nation box set and a tape for las nostilevo s first vinyl release arrives on scrapes a chicago label run by alex barnett (aka champagne mirrors half of blackest ever blacks barnett + coloccia) comprises six greyscale productions of varying tempos and a lean concentrated quality each one employs little more than a spidery synth line or two a bare-bones percussive framework and (on most of them) voices pushed through a distinctive hollow reverb is an arpeggiated call to arms replete with dispassionate vocals and clever key changes sounding like a skeletal electro cut amps up the gloom with woozy minor-key pads setting up s minute-long drum outburst on the flip and the title cut are standouts the former is a 90 bpm mini-epic thats heavy on breathless intonations and rapid-fire synth squelches the urgent 16th-note rush of the latter would work perfectly in a film noir soundtrack listen to it and you can almost see a cinematic zoom onto a car racing down some fateful highway with yet more sinuous synths metallic vocals and fragmented drums closes another strong effort from this intriguing artist
is prolific an unjustified word to describe carl and his slew of quality remixes over the years i don t think so and now a by the canadian electro pop duo can be added to the output list their ritish counterparts hot chip the oys have crossover appeal to both ravers and rockers alike i m always a sucker for some quality vocals in my house music thus a lends itself well to the remix treatment with jeremy greenspan s sultry whisperings leading the charge strips it all back to great effect speeding things up for the dance floor and leaving only a continuous loop of the opening melody while the original is a slow dreamy melodic number creates a building intensity really stretching it out fter working you up for a good four minutes the beat finally drops and you are left with a sense of satisfaction that carl has come through again; all that s left is to shake your ass and ride it on home south london via glasgow s kode 9 admirably represents the dubstep sound with his reinterpretation of this is actually kode 9 s second go-round with the previously reworking stalker back in 2004 i say reinterpretation rather than remix as hardly any of the original elements of the song are present except for a single guitar riff (with the proverbial dubbed out delay added of course) and the sinister utterings you re two-faced your lost twin you re my double shadow delivered to great effect by a vocal that sounds more like vintage massive ttack than this track has a really sleazy element to it and i could easily imagine myself cranking this out while cruising down the street in my 5 0 with the rag top down so my hair can blow t the end of the day dubstep is dubstep and this track ticks all the archetypal boxes dark: check low pms with lots of delay: check sinister vocals: check whether the ravers and rockers will be willing to make the jump to the dubby dark side is another story
k lex green and damon kirkhamduo have been causing a buzz in the drum bass scene with a fresh sound that clearly pays tribute to and is influenced by what has been called the golden age of drum bass (1996-1998 give or take a year or two ) the duo had their first foray into production with the legendary source direct around the year 2000 but after only a few releases they went on a hiatus that lasted until 2006 since then their releases on the mysterious darkestral label and on marcus intalexs soul:r label have felt like a breath of fresh air in the polarised drum bass scene this 12-inch sees them at the top of their game delivering a dark and brooding halfstep number and an electro tinged roller with swirling retro sounding synths starts with tension-building pads that are unleashed with a fierce almost tribal backing beat the percussion is intricately twirled around the drums and hints of the bass to come are teased before the tune drops with a pounding bass line the flipside is based on the same ingredients but is in another vein altogether multiple pads and synths are layered around a tribal rhythm that feels slower than it really is the bright synths and stabs contrast with the brooding bass offering new elements for the listener to discover each time the darkestral label has emblazoned its releases with a motto: 170 bpm respect the speed limit its a barrier that most drum bass crashed through over a decade ago but looks back with a rose-tinted glasses employing a warm and rich sound that still somehow feels unique and are a treat to drum bass heads but also to dance music fans in general dont miss out
hot off the press comes digweeds new imprint b_rock records with a tight first release from brancaccio aisher featuring the vocals of lanni - suicide sports club and is the first track off their forthcoming electric mistress album due for release in october last ghost in town has the b a stamp all over it from the beginning as tight percussion together with rezing synth line winds its way around the track while an almost disco-punk groove has been set vocals are added along with snare rolls and distorted guitar chords feed that swirl around till what comes next completely stopping briefly as the pressure is eased off and gradually building back adding a sublime piano sequence that lifts up the mood the production is cool and crisp on this long awaited new material from luke brancaccio and bruce aisher which is more than likely going to be making an appearance on a dancefloor near u soon the a side has a redanka remix andy colt keeps the dirty edge of the original and smooths out the beats to an almost billie jean-esque form using the parts of the original to create a heavier concoction theres a re-work from the duo too which kind of fits in-between the other two takes with not such a dirty groove but satisfying all the same
falling up crew members and jay l have been responsible for some of the most overlooked house singles to come out of bristol in recent years jay l had his moment in the sun with a 12-inch on brstl last year the gorgeous looking up pt 1 / try slung and mac debuted the year before with everytime both explored summery dusty grooves more indebted to detroit house than many of their bristol peers although macs productions in particular sported weighty basslines befitting of their punch drunk home this double 12-inch package from is the first weve heard from either producer since and with the exception perhaps of detroit-ish house number (a collaboration with fellow falling up founder typesun) there are few audible ties with the his past work instead regular irregular s five tracks are patient and sparsely arranged compositions that explore a variety of styles but revel in their own simplicity generally this approach works nicely sun-drenched desire wavers in intensity as if seen through a heat haze; at the other end of the thermometer s sparse chords peer out from a bleak landscape of halftime percussion and ponderous sub-bass in nonchalant electro number nowhere on which both jay l and typesun lend a hand the payoff comes several minutes in with gorgeous twinkly synth chords only the techno-leaning s drags a fact not helped by its abrasive flanged hi-hats which quickly tire the ears se tracks could arguably be more succinct but their simple almost live jam-style construction is part of their charm
certainly no strangers to funky breaks moston malente have been releasing electro and breaks tunes on labels such as moonbootique and unique with malente making a big name for himself with genre defying electro b-boy funk and breaks monsters such as we came to party and the law is wrong - tunes that have found themselves in the record boxes of any dj whose sole mission is to rock the party australias nick thayer has been roped in to provide a remix and this should only further cement his place in the international breaks scene following on from remixes put out by streetwise hot cakes and his breakspoll award winning remix of the drumattic twins feeling kinda strange the 2 only gets its name from the slowed down hip hop vocal sample laced in the tune but the real essence of the tune comes from the infectious breakbeat which sounds like the beat from blurs song 2 at the beginning and then morphs into a party rockin groover during the first breakdown the pair introduce a funky synth sample which pays homage to the synth sounds of old skool breaks and is teamed up with a growly bass line to fatten up the bottom end on the flip nick thayers remix starts off with a deep and sinister tone starting off with a solo hi-hat subtle synth work and a techy hook the intro slowly bubbles up and breaks out into a highly energetic piece with a bassline thats easier on the ears climbing sweeps and wicked percussion work its certainly a busier sounding tune than the original and is made for more energetic dancefloors the vocal sample is cut up and reworked into the background so much so that its unrecognisable from the original tune and to top it all off nick then lays down a synth melody of his own interesting
next up on the always interesting french based f-communications is another solid release from the label favourites 2 reworkings of this production are packed in this release including a very tasty swayzak version on the b-side first up though is the serious rework on the whole it is quite a chunky yet quirky tech house cut a very weird computerized vocal rides over most of the production while trippy sounds and warped effects trickle away in the foreground as the track builds the sounds get a little more warped really making this record quite unique and not for everyone s liking very twisted stuff on the a-side the james swayzak back to 92 dub is also quite a unique production throbbing retro baselines pulsate throughout while a very chunky kick gives the track a big room appeal again some quirky vocal effects feature throughout and as the track progresses some eerie effects make their way into the track becoming more prominent a very tough track to write about and like many other f-communications releases words do not tell the whole story well worth a look this release with the b-side for me being the better production
f there once seemed a certain contentment from indie oriented listeners to let labels like df or maybe smalltown supersound serve as their only loci of crossover dance musics certainly gained another potent voice in munichs much of this appeal lies in the labels ability to straddle the admittedly ever shrinking home/club divide n four short years the has established itself as one of electronic musics most diverse and multifaceted imprints significantly in terms of drawing the attention of more traditionally album friendly stratums the labels nailed the dance lp not once but twice on the maurice fulton helmed kathy diamond album miss diamond to and on the lovelorn electro pop of s guilty pleasure but what began as ostensibly a more classical house and disco affair has lengthened its sonic arc dramatically in the intervening years drawing in hairy prog rock soundtrack and library music balearic and blue eyed alo like that of label chanteuse with blog spotlight cuts and floor dynamos like the fizzy piano romp of s the sunny diterranean haze of s matildas and especially and s infectious 90s radio house throwback the last year or so has brought the label even more attention thankfully for the neat and tidy amongst us s summarizing that period by issuing the second edition of selected label works a series quickly summiting the annual label comp pile t two discs and total tracks is just as with the first admittedly a lot to take in frankly its probably a must own for the home listening set just for collecting the tracks mentioned above but these are tough times for those of you looking for a little more encouragement its safe to say the comps loaded with hirsute little escapes and dance floor delusions ( and is strutty wide eyed balearic disco of questionable vintage while jacques s excellent remix of s that mounting paradise garage bassline that chicago piano assault and most importantly that sultry vocal vamping seems potent and persuasive enough to argue as a classic in the make s night with guest vocals from is sadder and more lonesome a bit of slow pitched first morning pop more appropriate for rainy nights indoors than dance floor hedonism s with last years edition the boys behind m bioly and benjamin fr hlich arent content just manning the comps assembly most notably they turn in a compelling original the pummeling string laced funk of which churns into a stormy blast of horns and a remix of s drenched in echo and heavy hand drumming s ndian also gets the remix treatment from brits mock of who imbue the cuts bouncy house with a midnight forest vibe thats partly spiritual and partly just kind of spooky s such its sort of the ideal representative for a label as simultaneously zany peculiar and persistently engaging as irs is a brainy kind of delirium as focused on floor release as on those 3 m detours on routes one recognizes only in daylight
its best not to read into the concept of marvin guys inspired by an automotive theme as old as the highway tarmac kraftwerk first drove on might sing like an engine moving through the gears on but the ep is notable for its more straightforward qualities as well as being impeccably produced the music draws on offbeat-yet-accessible disco mutations of late 70s rock clipped kosmische and lindstr m-style electronics the feedback-laden guitar chords and glassy organ melodies of tune into something between skatt bros walk the night and pink floyds another brick in the wall if its s most distinguished track then its followed closely by which secures humming synths and glinting arpeggios to crisp percussion and s wafting voice breezy and pastoral those epic 13 minutes seem to drift by in half the time another lengthy piece sounds faintly threatening beneath windswept synths and light squiggles of electric guitar but its meandering transitions and excessive runtime ultimately feel aimless

warren harris has his own guidelines governing his exploration of the deep throughout his work youll find noodley keys exquisite vocal samples a tendency not to quantize and a penchant for sounds that might be called dainty synth-flute filigrees soft pads etc i dont really listen to house and electronic music harris said in a 2001 interview im more of a musician and into the harmonics im more of an artist im not into it from the dance perspective im into the chords and real deep stuff its appropriate that he wound up with a 12-inch on whose label head theo parrish is known for finding funkiness in the most unlikely bins of the record store its also fitting that would a decade after its initial release find itself deserving of a repress anyone whos ever tried to mix these loose and jaunty tracks can tell that harris didnt have the djs best interests in mind when he made them though most djs who hear these tunes will want to play them out and both beautiful and funky are the best candidates makes this record a sensible summertime repress its an expressive groove whose principal melodic elements are acoustic guitar somber piano and a riddle of a fretless bass here harris found new depths of deep and people need to hear it
i tend to like l i e s best when its in loner mode artists like terekke and florian kupfer understand club conventions but their music sounds like it was dreamed up in bedrooms with the curtains permanently drawn add to that list hailing from somewhere as with plenty of l i e s artists you wont find many good leads at this stage the producer displays a keen ear for body-moving rhythm on the third record for ron morelli while theres plenty to get your feet tapping the drum programming elastic and slicing is stellar across all three tracks theres teasingly little to whistle along to theres melody here to be certain but stifles it for as long as possible on most of the synth riff sounds muffled as it climbs higher in the scale though a few full-fledged screams slip through the woozier keeps similarly mum until an epic swell in the second half theres very little that suggests its coming and it doesnt exactly lead anywhere but the section is gorgeous in the context of an otherwise bone-rattling rhythm track comes closest to a massive tune with irresistible electro drumming carrying a hands-in-the-air hook s weird add-ons crunchy field recordings from what sounds like an inner-city park will make it a hair too damaged for most record bags morelli of course isnt averse to signing straight-up floor-fillers but as close as comes its another ep for shut-ins by shut-ins
is the brain child of jeremy sylvester whose releases/remixes have been seen on various 2-step cds and most notably the stanton session where be bop became known as an underground 2-step/breaks classic with this release jeremy follows a similar formula and also creates another track with some interesting old skool elements thrown in side a the fearless track on a similar style to be-bop this track is a much slower breaks song and lifts vocal samples from old kung-fu movies just like be-bop did the overall feel of this track is basically a song that could be used in the fighting scene of any movie with its aggressive bassline and synth samples that you could swear were used in a bruce lee movie soundtrack side b the fresh stuff not an entirely new concept hip hop and 2-step make an interesting team up in this old-skool throwback and work quite well with samples lifted off an old breakdance movie and another asking the crowd to turn it up this is the sound that the freestylers were doing back with their we rock hard album but with a 2-step attitude totally fresh - werd
in his review of s first album for this is always where youve lived justin farrar observed how like a faded memory teetering on the verge of dissolution singer and producer ryan martin sounds as if he could cease to exist at any moment same could be said of what would come two years later martin has said that for his second vinyl full-length he took himself out of the process as much as he could in order to let the music play itself north carolinians light touch is felt in parts of these six synthy mutations particularly when a distant voice or noodling melody appears but desolation surrounds it all seems curious to discover what little human presence is needed to explore the unknown corners of its creators mind martins songs favor loops and drones set well below 100 bpm which he gently nudges and alters with effects as they carry on for the likes of and that means a narcotic drift through dark hollows while uses the method to uncover randomized pop ideas sounds like s most intentional song a sullen centerpiece that spreads post-punk gloom over a drawn out verse-chorus structure martin strums a bass riff so slow and simple that it almost doesnt sound like a hook and the plaintive synth chords in the chorus are so bright you almost cant hear him whispering the vocal theme serendipity of martins unconscious music is mesmerizing but reveals his underused ear for avant-pop songwriting whatever the approach is from track to track delicate source materials tactile textures and sparse layering make an immersive record as in groupers ruins or even certain moments in joy divisions music martin makes isolation feel both inescapable and enlightening by the time he ends on m an emotional revolution has occurred echoing the noisy awe of jefre cantu-ledesmas a year with 13 moons the closer plays like a slow billowing ascension it could evoke an out-of-body experience as much as an internal epiphany or some combination of the two disconnecting himself from the outside world and unravelling his thoughts through incidental music martins creative process for was like a form of meditation and in its final minutes he allows himself transcendence
francis harris is making the best music of his career right now and anthony collins can take some of the credit for that parisian producer has had quite an effect on harris (including convincing him to co-found the scissor thread label) and the music they make together as frank tony is some of the best in either artists discography ahead of their upcoming debut album they release an ep that towers over the six already excellent 12-inches theyve put out so far when i interviewed harris earlier this year he spoke of his very personal connection with terre thaemlitz aka after a series of remixes harris and thaemlitz finally collaborate properly on which is as touching an effort as you could hope for from those two and collins easily stands up against recent tracks it digs a tunnel of reverb for distant gospel vocals to reverberate through and perfectly matches thaemlitzs gift for smouldering melodies with harris and collins slinky rhythms its a tough act to follow but the two other cuts both of which are taken from the upcoming lp do just fine sounds like it couldve been a holdover from minutes of sleep harriss standout solo album again the duo show an uncanny gift for slow-burning drama pairing s pained vocal with low almost funereal synths where you think it might get melodramatic it stays stoic moving with the same restrained poise as deep house producers like traumprinz is a smoky house track that shows harriss recent obsession with layering listen closely and you can hear what sounds like multiple levels of granular texture all held up by a heavy reassuring house music heartbeat
theres been at least some overlap between dutch producers steffie doms and martijn deykers but these days the former tends to lean on electro and the latter has continued his interest in uk sounds but one thing they both excel with is big striking basslines evidenced in full on ostgut ton zehn where they delivered the goods on solo tracks and as doms deykers that collaboration whirling was a step forward from the pairs first ep fonts the people tapping into a more balanced blend of the distinctive styles involved and the sound continues onto whose three tracks mix dayglo synths punchy basslines and breaks with touches of acid and techno doms deykers establish a solid formula here but they fail to find a range of uses for it everything on the ep clocks in around 130 bpm and aims for a well-worn kind of melodic euphoria with tight-rope-walking strings and warm familiar pads flanking the tough rhythmic elements t all works best on the nimble and sharp gets a little messy on ts and sounds drained of some necessary energy come they may not all be of the exact same quality but they all have the exact same qualities is said to be an introduction to doms deykers debut album set for release later this year hopefully by then theyll figure out what else to do with their shared interests
if you re a fan of electro music then chances are you ve heard of dj hell and his label international dj gigolo records a label that has hosted many of the worlds most famous electro dj s and producers such as miss kittin and fischerspooner e of the up and coming artists on this label is matt sims aka originally releasing his 20 album ultrasex on international dj gigolo records is back with his newest offering titled this new album is straight up electro with some new wave and dark wave influences any one who is familiar with late 80 s new wave will recognize many of the sounds on this release much like new wave artists of the 1 80 s a considerable amount of the vocals in the tracks are heavily synthesized and the kick drums hi-hats and snares that comprise the majority of the songs are all familiar 80 s and 0 s electro sounds album itself is diverse enough that it would make a good asset to a dj or also be welcome in the collection of an average listener re are many upbeat tracks that lend a very danceable sound but there are also very interesting atmospheric soundscape style tracks mixed in with slow down tempo electro re are not many electronic artists that can produce entire albums of original material that are enjoyable throughout however this is one of them much like a tremendous amount of other electro albums a lot of the songs sound very under produced although this may sound like the true case a majority of electro producers like to give a minimal sound to their tracks so basically if you like a lot of stuff going on in your song this may not be the album for you i do have to say however that has much more groovin baselines and atmospheric pads than your average electro producer some of the better tracks on this album include s and volts for a fan of dj hell s international dj gigolo label this is another solid release if you don t know too much about the electro sound then i suggest that you try and give the album a listen before you pick it up for fans of tiga miss kittin hacker blackstrobe felix da housecat tiefschwarz and devo
for a while there i was worried that was becoming complacent with his first record for the swedish label since last years smoke mirrors lp proves otherwise mostly its a record which pursues the same consistent grooves that the imprint favours so highly but with a few detours along the way for instance near the middle of in something like a grimy trance lead arcs suddenly overhead briefly stealing the focus before sims drops things heavily back into place opts for a more lopsided cadence stomping menacingly forward like a infantry column 8-bit notes swarm over this foundation like bees on a hive overwhelming with sheer numbers rather than individual power on the flip sees sims puts all his eggs in one basket concentrating almost solely on a ringing metallic sequence which is suspended halfway between melody and percussion its entrancing enough that the simplicity of the tracks basic structure hardly registers last the title track heaves with rage positioning 4/4 bamboo-on-concrete claps under a taut bassy synth former propels the track along while the latter shreds it to pieces with furious intensity shimmying through a lengthy sequence like a convulsing electrical wire at its core isnt a major departure from s canon its still extremely functional extremely big room and somewhat anthemic but by dint of sims unusual timbres its one of the labels most interesting singles from the past few years
the label run by daniel martin mccormick aka has thus far been almost exclusively a vehicle for the new york producers own work this four way split ep presumably heralds a widening of the roster it features two tracks from label debutants and alongside cuts from himself and the only outside artist to have previously released on the label martin mccormick is at pains to emphasise that this is still a family affair however with all the contributors having either worked or lived together jacob long aka who used to play bass with in mi ami gets things started with a mellow meandering ensemble of glowing keys echoing hats and muffled kicks it sets a broadly ambient tone that prevails through much of the release magic touch turns in a beatless spiraling tumble of synths on and closes with the glacially paced wafting clank of despite the signpost that is its title s comes as a surprise given the woozy loveliness elsewhere a buzzy club banger somewhat redolent of drop the lime its bass pings and chaotic snares arent unpleasant exactly but nor are they compelling enough to justify breaking the records blissful spell
despite being only a young label itself illusion recordings already has an offshoot: innercircle taking charge of its second release is one of the umpteen hot waves associates with something that feels a little too plastic to really warrant excitement its ably put together but feels staid in its clean lines predictable arrangement and overly long nine-minute duration what makes the package worthy of your attention though are the remixes dogmatik boss and resurgent producer lex rnout goes first removing the manufactured tension of the original before layering it up with bubbly drums and a pixelated melodic hook then comes the package highlight: a mix from uzuri boss lerosa that burrows deep goes slow(er) and wallows with a sense of sensuous self-satisfaction mild acid gurgles break up the smoothness but a very real human heat remains firmly in place throughout each gentle undulation
s debut might be built from a minimal palette but there is a lot going on surprisingly it arrives on dj pinchs bristol-based label tectonic a label more associated with speaker-crushing dubstep than the almost bass-less percussive experiments found here strips dubstep down to its core on the album: gone are the decorations and almost all of the bottom end instead the damage is delivered through the brutal weight of the kick drum interleaved by simple sonic textures that slide freely around beneath the surface in slick fast-running oily tides it is a sound first heard in 00 on well-received random trio ep and two of the cuts from that record appear again here formed random trio with omni in 00 and after stints at the legendary rinse fm and ingrained with the eternal spirit of south london s pirate radio scene now seems to be branching more out into his own sound world to great effect his music has often been compared to burial s urban melancholy and at times there are parallels with photek s drill n bass or shackleton s ethnic percussive pressure particularly on the most emotive track on the album but overall such comparisons are misleading almost comes across more old school more breakbeat science but at a slower pace you wont find burial s sensitivity has instead the lucid urban dream/nightmare qualities of aphex twin s selected ambient works ii particularly on tracks such as and and where photek and shackleton are sculptured is almost completely modular: there is a strange absence of fluidity in its place a pure construction ethic with parts of beats put together like lego and even though the tracks are built from similar pieces the overall effect is strangely diverse gathers pace and intensity as it moves on such that by the end it seems almost frantic key to this effect is the space and detail in the snare sounds which add gas to the kick drum breaks as the album warms up and while there isnt much bass to be found its not completely absent for example contains a signature dubstep bass yet it is played almost like a fat pulsing drone than a real bootylicious bottom end tracks such as and are underpinned by traces of bass warble too indeed if you listen carefully youll hear yet beautiful waves of almost invisible deepness in every track which is why is not really music for the ipod it is an album of almost inaudible sounds subtleties inflections and sleight of hand headphones will give you a clue where to listen but the volume knob certainly puts the physicality of this music in its rightful place you could do a lot worse than give yourself some ear damage by turning this one up
do you like maple syrup on your bacon how about salt on your mango or pepper on your strawberries if you ve never tried any of these things you re probably making a yuck face right now but you d be wrong these flavours might seem worlds apart but they complement each other perfectly i don t know who first came up with these combinations but whoever did was some sort of culinary genius nd being a genius dj is essentially the same thing making musical connections that no one else would make the walls between rock and dance have been breaking down for years but for some reason the same thing isn t true for dance and hip hop (jay haze s street soldier posturing excepted) but it s a missed opportunity because the two genres have been steadily getting more and more similar electrohouse is of course founded on electro which back in the eighties was hip hop by another name electro built its rhythms with the 808 drum machine while dirty south hip hop is still all about the 808 and it s been getting faster and more electronic sounding for years in both genres are over their respective artistic peaks and are now utterly populist club fodder nd populism is great the essence of dancing in a club is that everyone their loves what s being played and feeds off of each other s enjoyment to create a sticky explosion of pleasure but it s also hard how many truly great djs are there that can play all the hits in a way that works and doesn t feel clunky very few because most djs feel this is somehow beneath them so the thing that makes this such a fucking amazing mix cd is that - has found a way to put all the most obvious tracks on a mix ( e talking hustler ) but make it all sound new and fresh by putting southern rap vocals over the top and by producing his own custom remixes of old favourites it s infectious even if you hate poppy electrohouse normally you can t help but smile at how friendly and fun-loving it all is i remember when scratch djs were all this goofy and enjoyable something weird happened in recent years when cash money jazzy jeff craze et al all figured out they could make big money by essentially phoning in the same identikit mixes of the big hip hop club hits du jour - is a different beast though he harks back more to the stoned shenanigans of qbert and kid koala not that he doesn t have his own chops he s won a dmc championship and he s kanye west s tour dj and although this mix isn t about scratching he gives a little taste of just what he can do at the end dirty south dance does of course owe more than a little debt to the fusion of italo and hip hop on some of diplo s older tapes before he got so infatuated with mi and carioca funk - s skills however are far superior this isn t just an incongruous mash-up of different styles it s got that same magic as spinbad s rock the kasbah (a scratch mix of eighties pop classics often heralded as the best hip hop mixtape ever) in that it spots unexpected connections between tracks and makes them flow musically in a completely surprising but utterly perfect manner i m not going to call out tracks because you ll know them (well okay just one: get on my pony blows the er roof off the sucka guess which songs it combines ) just know that this mix cd is perfect perfect in that it absolutely captures a moment in time from not one but two genres if you want something to put on to start the house party or to rev up your energy when you re getting ready to go out you won t find better this year nd if it makes a few dance fans go out and find out a bit more about hip hop so much the better

the duo of orde miekle and stuart mcmillan that make up slam sure know how to make a bit of a classic record tracks like positive education and life times live well in the memory and the destiny of their latest single looks set to walk down a similar path featuring the vocals on ann saunderson this release is set to make a big splash first up is the slam vocal mix and from the word go this track kicks into gear good solid beats merge early with nice hypnotic melodies while effected string patterns intertwine with a deep trademark slam baseline ann s vocals soon kick in giving the track a delicious vibe helped with the drums getting a little more intensified as the vocals lift up a gear the baseline then gets a little grittier late in the track creating an anthemic piece of work helped by some stunning string tweaks and the fantastic vocals the slam dub on the flip is also the perfect antidote for those looking to exclude the vocals in itself the production and musical elements of are fantastic it is often true that the musical elements take a back seat when strong vocals are present but this is definitely an exception as this dub is just as addictive as the vocal a fantastic release here by slam and a healthy taste of the delights to expect from their forthcoming album on soma
to my ears (aka david koch) works best at the murky end of the minimal spectrum over the years hes dabbled in many of the genres forms feel-good selections like the ones on his 2012 album haunt rolling peak-time house for vakant and piano-laden stompers on his own label have all helped make up a varied but unflashy catalogue kochs latest offering is the six-track in it he explores deeper textures and the result is one his most accomplished works so far is available in two parts the a-side of part i is upbeat getting underway with the records shuffling 10-minute title track its all about drums on the flip the wonky bass-heavy is the kind of track youd hear at the tail-end of an extended get perlonized or club der visionaere session trippy but skill kicking hard is the releases best cut though gloomy its big broken beat and buried vocal pack a punch part ii begins with another expansive and bottom-heavy track despite its fluttery keys a chunky low-end gives it a dense subaquatic vibe zero point continues the foggy theme with chugging percussion and hazy stabs the retro finale is another highlight its glistening mid-range is begging for afterhours plays and it caps off an impressive release from one of the hardest workers in minimal house
trax endures for all kinds of reasons history some great tunes assiduous positioning on part of copyright owners while contemporaneous dj international has more or less disappeared but one of strongest is its sheer fucking weirdness does a normal person make a record like to ide or or cid trax (i mean 13 minutes of that ) traxs personality was both campy and severe; its glory years were few but early stuff has a hungry obsessive quality with few equals in any era of dance music edited doesnt try to match that disruptiveness even a little: se edits are very thats both ir making and undoing most of whats here is very streamlined which is odd for music that was originally so uninhibited t for nothing is justin s version of s to called edo with updating beats for xaviera golds vocals to ride over and thats one of better tracks here (ditto similarly reverent treatment of s to ide k greatest prince rip ever by bubba t bone ) if only way to accurately judge a remix is by whe r or not youd toss original over boats side for it only a couple things here come up trumps rest is merely solid and sometimes stolid ay s take on s sets a template many o rs follow and which transcends; its a modern slow build that eventually works up sparks many times those sparks are spare in arriving el s endless circle 12 minute version of s a is exhibit but sometimes remixers imbue things with a bit more heat by and version of doniss ockin gives it some juicy disco flair isolating suspended synth chords and freeze framing m to mirror ball like effect leo turns obert right out concentrating on a sublimely jackin groove that keeps twisting thanks to his endless filtering interrupting and bounding of central phrase ( let em fall ) ll that gimmickry though is exactly in trax spirit this compilation thats a rarity
such is ibizas overarching influence on global clubland its all too easy to pass over music from its neighbour mallorca the tortuously-monikered 1000smiley faces angel mora are a frenchman frann delice and two mallorquin producers enrique xuzav sitjar and angel mora who state a pretty solid case for further investigation of whats happening on the balearics largest island that said its a dutchman david who is given lead-off duties on debut release his take on is a jacked-up slab of skippety east coast house that doesnt quite fire the imagination as much as the original does here 1000smiley faces angel mora we promise thats the last time well mention them adopt a classic approach from the outset an insistent piano lick straight from the dubtribe sound system school of uplifting organic house sets its controls straight for the heartstrings with heavily-treated testifying -style vocals simmering in the background before they are brought fully into bloom the leix remix of strikes out on an original us garage tip although some intriguing beeps and boings are added along the way it somewhat pales in comparison with the original however whose trippy pads phase in and out of the mix in a display of stereophonic dexterity on this evidence we suggest that future releases give second billing to the remixers
harry agius recent output most notably safi the percussive-heavy track he gave to the african charity project hes involved with have increasingly focused on stripping away excess melodic fat in favor of nailing the groove while this remains the case on much of s latest ep for aus hes hardly engaging in raw minimalism theres light to counter the shade all three tracks feature dense drums and bass the most melodic of the trio proceeds at a steady gallop with pulsating pads garagey snares and a lovely bass pattern what really elevates it however is when agius subtly introduces a rousing string vignette fizzing with energy wanders into deep jacking territory an area that agius remains in for here he scrunches up an alarm throb heavy breaths and a twisted feline whine and throws a juddering simple beat at them the results from a man who shows little sign of ending his impressive run of form make a real impact
in 2003 terence fixmer and nitzer ebb frontman douglas mccarthy teamed up for the first time as fixmer / mccarthy their destroy / freefall ep was the amuse-bouche to the duos debut album etween the devil off that teaser destroy was heavy-fisted and full of hate spiked with an aggro technoid streak that felt more hardcore for the dance floor than the e m-indebted techno fixmer made solo freefall on the other hand sounded like depeche mode doing an international deejay gigolo hit dark electro with pop appeal the record transcended what each artist had been known for individually without straying far outside their shared gene pool it also established the two polar extremes that etween the devil would journey between fixmer has since weaned himself off e m on his solo outings for electric deluxe and clr typified by the two albums with a strong sense of space and sound design mccarthy also struck out on his own notably as part of djm/rex a new modular synth-based collaboration with l artist cyrusrex and others marks the duos first studio reunion in eight years and its a timely reanimation of the sound they first plundered the titular -side is a great big dirge its strummed bass so low and guttural snarls like a beast as mccarthy wails the songs only two lines: many words so many lies and i cant take any more nguish spirals in the vocals and fixmer reciprocates ramping up the background din in the closing quarter the drums stick to their leaded clomp however like an interminable death march once it boils over the track evaporates in a mist of breathy vapours on the flip fixmers instinct mix is a stinging spitting hissing rebuttal to the original delivering the digital angst of destroy with a modern cadence
though most attention on vancouvers increasingly prominent underground focuses on mood hut the launch of a label from a burgeoning online record store run by friends of that crew proves that others have just as much to offer the new imprints first release rhythms of the pacific vol 1 is a local affair that showcases the increasingly distinct sound of the canadian riviera (as they affectionately call it) featuring tracks from mood huts hashman gear wizard and one of vancouvers most promising new names it shows that vancouvers dance music scene is as healthy as its ever been s two tracks take up a whole side the first is an extended mix of a highlight from his excellent debut album on 1080p earlier this year and its a welcome reprise epitomizes the vibe of vancouvers new wave of house music producers its got a loungey bassline a daydreaming melody and luscious samples perfectly capturing the dazed feeling that unites so many of the citys producers his other contribution 2) shows a tougher side relentlessly funky and rinsing out a stoic chord progression on the flipside who has appeared on mood hut and black opal in the past offers up another slice of dance floor catnip with sitting on harsh oddly detuned drums this ones all about crunch from the acrid acid lines to the raspy chord stabs hashman s remix of an unknown quantity rounds things off in grubbier fashion: trigger happy delay smears a vocal across the jittery rhythm section for something that feels both pointed and psychedelic
juan atk s first album 16 years is as sh y and old-fashioned as a t foil spacesuit thats not to say its cheap or th is sumptuously produced but rather that its vision of the future feels dated in the same way sci-fi evolved from star trek s space-age optimism to alien s forbidd g dystopia so techno has moved on from atk s sleek computer dreams to someth g darker much of sounds like it could have been produced on the same equipment atk s used on the first ep 1985s no more ufos in fact most of the record sounds even older than 1999s m d and body forsak g that lps soul and techno fusion to zoom right back to the pure robo-funk of mid-80s tracks like drive (thru-babylon) with its brittle electro beats and synthesised vocal isnt a cous of that tune so much as a sibl g separated at birth of course its actually a very good th g to sound like classic many artists have spent their careers aim g for exactly that and if youre not expect g anyth g groundbreak g here then what youre left with is impressive s low-end wump suggests atk s is on at least nodd g terms with bass music but the best th g about it are its str gs and the c ematic flourishes that recall old tracks like urban tropics fellow detroit pioneer mike banks had a hand produc g the album and - sounds as good as anyth g from his outfit galaxy ii galaxy but its perhaps the guitar solo which makes you th k more of jimmy page with his foot on the monitor than any futurist adventurer that says the most about solution s place the current scheme of th gs like technos equivalent of 70s rock legends on a reunion tour atk s is past his prime but still perfectly capable of satisfy g his fans he may be trad g more the glow of nostalgia than the shock of the new but he can still deliver the goods
fred ps techno alter ego deserves to become a regular fixture if is anything to go by s a producer renowned for melodic ultra-deep house it comes as no surprise that the new yorkers brand of techno is up to a point melodic and deep is the most serene thinghere straying only slightly from a feathery bed of pads and pinging synths that despite their fluffiness overwhelm the driving kicks things become more interesting when the hostile locked groove of moves into view linear bassline and tapping percussion square up alongside clanks and a trippy subtle drone if you recognise bove thats because it closed fred ps 2011 compilation c o m e phased synths pulse and recede across its length helping offset thrusting kicks s with the rest of the ep it grabs your attention by gently flicking your ear rather than whacking you across the chops
paul boexs rotterdam-based imprint has heavily featured a collaboration between boex and label regular dave miller recently the duos first two form function records drew remixes from a cross-section of techno talent (milton bradley dasha rush delta funktionen and ben sims) and the third entry in the series features one original track alongside three reinterpretations its probably itself thats the most impressive here or at least the most unique with that one boex and miller provide just enough little flourishes a fuzzy modulated riff at work in the low-end or the sirens that occasionally swing in from above to keep things compelling mike s remix stays true to the sound of his loop-based analog productions where otherworldly hiccups are endlessly repeated to reveal subtle fractal effects next up is norman who suppresses the originals gurgling bass and stuffs the rest of the space with typically -like flurries of hi-hats both and keep their tracks near the driving floor-ready tempo of the original area on the other hand pitches his remix down its pleasantly airy and i like the sounds (especially the little twists on elements pulled from the original) but the whole thing comes across as a bit too subdued and formulaic overall nothing spectacular but a diverse set of tracks that techno djs will surely fit into the mix
dub techno isnt often a party-starter but dont tell that to one of the founders of brooklyns famously sweaty turrbotax nights after releases for dutty artz and local action the michigan native returns with an ep for san franciscos label paper its a dub techno record with all the murky minor-key chords and focus on atmosphere that entails in practice its something else entirely anyone whos been to turrbotax will be aware of the partys fondness for fog machines and s music evokes the thickness of the air there is meticulously constructed but listen carefully and youll hear nuggets of painstaking detail occasionally pushing through the hefty pulse the dub influence is especially apparent on where expansive washes of windswept sound float over neatly interwoven drums finding room in the mix for some moodymann-style flourishes ghosts clears the air and lightens the mood with his uncluttered and thoroughly unpretentious remix robert s masterful take on also streamlines s sound but only to make room for a powerful kick drum that grows more menacing by the bar
britton has a unique position in electronic music like many of her ibiza friendly peers she spent much of her early career as a bastion of house purism representing for the likes of panorama bar and perlon in dingy clubs and afterhours across europe se days though youre more likely to find her inside dc 10 than berghain and this change is reflected in her sound smooth low slung minimalism of her stellar panorama bar 01 mix seems to have been largely replaced by a more hard hitting and accessible palette more suited to the festival stages she now frequently finds herself on it comes as no surprise then that is glossy and upbeat staunch monologue on artus gets things underway with a bang and is followed by s choir sampling mix kicks into gear courtesy of from followed by a string of loopy groove led cuts from italo son and each transition is long and smooth creating a no frills ride to the mixs first big room moment: pachanga rework of s this is when really gets going s slamming is one of the mixs choice cuts heavily swung and full of energy digitised melody of s gives way to another standout selection from its a track thats been doing the rounds since its release this time last year and despite its toughness it slots in nicely here ensuing 20 minutes are the mixs most varied with britton stitching together the square waves of s piano house and subaquatic minimal of todd rework s 2008 track lon despite the large scope of the selections here feels completely coherent if anything it proves that regardless of context can put together an impressive set it might not be the timeless effort panorama bar 01 was but is an enjoyable ride nonetheless helmed by a jock who very clearly knows what shes doing
are nick chacona and controller sasse and their latest 12 is a slab of turn-of-the-century funk thats bound to please it s a slab of nyc-inspired deephousedisco that both recalls the reckless hedonism of dances embryonic golden age and then fast-forwards into the bowels of the modern day basement where the sound of residual italo and its hybrids still provide many of modern houses more uplifting moments original mix is my personal fave it keeps things moving with an effortless electronic throb that subtly modulates and occasionally breaks down into a filtered panorama of disco bliss finding room for a sinister voice that intones the title of the track prophetically darshan mix isn t quite as loveable lacking the warmth of the original it is very evocative of metro rea in their prime but apart from the arpeggiated synths (which for some reason always sound medieval to me) im not really grabbed dub is great rising and falling like a case of bubonic plague and all the time guided on its way by an ethereal synth that glides in and out of the mix its possibly the most driving of the three versions on offer ll three cuts subtly differ from each other this music is all about nuance and ive found myself listening to all four versions again and again deciding on a favourite is really not an easy decision at all i ll stick with the original but i may have changed my mind after the next listen
if the title of james harmon stacks debut album seems like a plea it might be because the brooklyn producer doesnt fit into any particular scene having moved around the us he doesnt slot into any geographical sound either starting out as one of many young producers pilfering ideas from hip-hop before techno stole his heart stacks idea of the genre is sleek and accessible fusing the harder rhythms of european techno with the more tuneful elements of his north american counterparts his debut album takes that idea one step further preferring brief bursts of melody over drawn-out grooves tell i belong takes influences from a range of dance genres and squashes them all into a compact 31 minutes stacks smooth workmanlike rhythms are the focal point of the record he folds in elements of garage dancehall and techno for a fusion that never feels flashy take its basically just pounding kicks and brusque vocal samples with all the fury of a fachwerk record but delivered in a skewed wonky cadence on the percussions perky drive lifts an otherwise dreary array of synths and pitched-down vocals while the giddy recalls the fizzy rush of what used to be called future garage that melodic streak is tell i belong s other hallmark late album highlight is built around a killer vocal hook worthy of a rihanna tune while the ribbons of silk soft organ sounds and ethereal female vocals of steer it in the direction of early 00s pop trance the first time the vocals match up with the twirling synths in its a near-perfect synchronicity tell i belong is full of moments like these but theyre always fleeting which means the lp falls short of true greatness s such easy listening that the uniform smoothness becomes a double-edged sword so breezy and lightweight it can float by without calling attention to itself if youre not listening closely that feeling is compounded by the shorter tunes which make an already short record feel shorter maybe stack prefers brevity; double the length of these tracks and youve got an hour-long lp as its presented his debut album is hesitant merely hinting at a strong aesthetic that hes been fleshing out in his dj sets one things for sure though: tell i belong makes me want to hear more
is an interesting genre with it s roots coming mainly from 2 styles techno and house tech-house has come to embrace elements from other genres lately such as breaks thanks to labels like kingsize whole 9 yards and fingerlickin to some extent and tribal elements come into play as well enter the new 12 from side a disco hit definitely dancefloor oriented this one is sure to become a disco hit utilising the usual 4/4 house beat (bass drum snare bass drum snare) it quickly builds up throws in some extra percussion (conga drums) also throw in a very familiar bassline which sounds like something from an s express song done years ago and add in vocal snippets possibly taken from a movie the title of the track says it all side b who are you starting off more percussive than disco hit and with those film-like vocal samples this b-side is some fine deep tech-house the bassline gets down low and the song quickly builds up adding more percussion a bit of reverb yet maintaining a sense of danceability even the parts where the beats cut out sound good this is the second release to come out on new tech-house label terry francis who recently mixed a fabric cd did their first 12 release with people like that on your roster how can you go wrong and this release confirms it very nice

keysound sometimes divides critics but most can agree that when it comes to new grime interpretations dusk and blackdown have been right on point wen and logos were responsible for some of the labels greatest moments in recent years records that have kept keysound a constant curiosity has already seen two fresh grime signings lamont and oil gangs jt the goon and now veteran steps up with the original production is sparse and primitive with just a hint of whimsy its the perfect accompaniment for jamakabis quick-fire verses which he reels off like automatic gunfire logos version is more ominous similar to how his tectonic album with mumdance proto revisited classic sounds with mechanical precision his remix is a plutonium-plated reanimation shot through with bullet holes blackdowns big size 12 remix is a vigorous shake up with syncopated claps chopped vocals and the only bassline here you can swing your hips to in its closing minute the remix is stripped bare except for the dissonant chords that have quietly spelled doom in the background the whole time a few hits bleeps and smears of jamakabis reverberated voice float in the void a strangely fitting end for the record
was matt werths good fortune that in 2009 brooklyn phono shipped the wrong test pressings to his rvng intl label he was instantly enchanted by the minimal yet evocative music of bing ruth an ensemble conceived by upstate composer david moore that particular album city lake was released on moores happy talk label in 2010 but bing ruths breakthrough album morrow was golden age came out on rvng intl four years later come bing ruth is on the renowned with their third album gone are the cellos that underpinned morrow was golden age and the guitar vocals and feedback that punctuated city lake moore strips the sound back to the core of his group: the entwined bass of greg chudzik and jeff ratner jeremy viners winding clarinet lines the subtle tape manipulations of mike effenberger and moores piano combining the beauty of harold budd and terry riley mesmerism the piano resonates front and center on on the first few listens one might think the album consists solely of moores undulating sustained chord clusters so closely do the other instruments shadow them among the coruscating piano lines of the stunning you can just make out the dual bass and the slow skyward arc of effenbergers tape delay slows things down as effenberger dabs washes of color into the open spaces between moores notes like the colors on the cover art the albums individual pieces flow into one another s a blurring that might mirror the way in which moore composed the album on his travels across the us uk and europe writing it on 17 different pianos at times his playing reminds me of the sustained clouds that keith tippett conjured on his free improv solo piano albums and lubomyr melnyk whose style is speedy to the point of stillness but theres a directness to moores playing and his ability to summon infinite space in a matter of minutes that sets him apart strikes a chord without uttering a word and while it was composed across so many pianos a wurlitzer spinet in california a nine foot-long steinway d in belgium sir elton johns red yamaha at londons royal albert hall bing ruth make them all sing as one voice
is a young producer who calls berlin home his third 12-inch the arrives a little more than a year after his promising debut on bt im that record showed his knack for swinging percussive dj tools and received widespread dj support ( night chime was picked up by pollonia for their fabric instalment) his latest effort hosted by is a long way from the stripped back sound of his maiden release but is every bit as good the melody-rich occupies the -side like the rest of the boston catalogue its loopy but strings and pronounced keys give it a vibrancy not seen in his work before ction channels digitalism with a vocal sample plucked from hakan lidbos 20000-relased walk way its the releases most jovial moment and is the pick of the bunch the closing track cid has a bass-heavy squelch but probably wont be the one djs reach for
the next release from gets unleashed on the imprint and this first disc of love song includes the skylark vocal and dub the vocal mix is first up and from the word go the production is nice and upbeat solid beats meet a quirky looped melody that keep the production bouncing along nicely expect the usual solid flow that skylark tend to have in their productions the dub mix follows a very similar pattern musically with many of the sounds and bouncy melodies used again to good effect perhaps a bit unfortunate that the formula wasnt altered as much as it could have been not a bad set of remixes from skylark but perhaps not as sharp as the remixes on disc two
s ends in a lurch in the midst of an impossibly complex series of harmonies the voices of lift off an uncertain chord and never hum another one the moment brings the album to a close though you wouldnt exactly call it a conclusion which as jarring as it may be is actually just fine because doesnt require much in the way of explication: its that rare experimental album thats nearly as easy to wrap your head around as a pop tune perhaps its because her concept is a fairly common one in electronic music herndon a former berlin club kid who now studies composition and music technology at stanford is one in a long line of producers and composers teasing out the humanity latent in machines herndon comes at it from the opposite direction though: instead of making her circuits pump with blood she presents humans as bit players in a particularly complex ableton session the primary sound on is the human voice but herndons main instrument is the laptop that gets them hissing buzzing clashing and pulsing (it seems like no mistake that the albums abrupt end feels a bit like a macbook dying mid-email ) although there are probably more organic sounds on this album than on the lions share of electronic records released this year its one of the chilliest youre likely to hear so while there are some beautifully transcendent moments on the title track where loopy acid sits beneath mile-wide vocal melodies is one such standout the results can feel more like data collection than truly compelling music her arrangements are constructed a bit like vocal warm-ups which has the odd effect of making the records workhorse sound underutilized and a little hackneyed still these freeform-feeling but deeply constructed exercises find herndon at her strongest; her beat-driven work like the knife-channeling is undercooked by comparison then is more a proof of concept than a fully fleshed-out thought though herndon brings enough passion to her sound to suggest one is coming
is the debut album by the duo of gerd janson and phillip lauer two talented individuals who have done fine work on their own lauers phillips lp released on jansons running back label in 2012 was a breezy and infectious collection jansons recent fabric 89 mix once again proved that hes as well-versed in the ways of house as anyone as the pair has racked up a discography of top-tier productions and remixes ranging from low-key melodic house charmers to tough acidic workouts the duos debut album features solid workmanlike house tunes with a few outliers tossed in for variety fuses stomping kicks and boogie-tinged low-end to soaring synths and percolating percussion while gets its drive from a propulsive bass and an array of blips and bleeps the throb of is punctuated by flitting fiddles (courtesy of tro areas go-to string man) while something that sounds like a synthesized accordion adds a touch of quirkiness to the tuneful theres nothing bad to say about any of them but knowing that theyre produced by janson and lauer they feel somewhat lacking a few songs stand out but none are flawless fans of 80s throwbacks will enjoy the big gated snare and eighth-note bassline of as well as the twitching electro of but the formers strained baritone courtesy of will be a turnoff for some and the latters big boilerplate melody sounds like it just missed festival season with on vocals fares better its syncopated kicks sinewy percussion and staccato synths give the song a slinky feel the albums biggest outlier might also be the biggest highlight the bouncy bassline synth pop melody and annies cooing vocals make for the records most sparkling moment surely have a great album in them isnt quite it
is next up on the very seductive sex on wax label and they deliver a very nice release in on the flip label favourite 16b provides his interpretation on a very good original mix it is that fine original mix that gets things going with some solid chunky tribal beats soon enough a smooth driving baseline enters the track while nice percussive elements ring the percussion then takes off with a good set of high hats and by this stage the track is well and truly in full swing some nice atmospheric effects towards the middle to end of the track give it a nice soothing aura and they add quite nicely to the overall track which is very nice on the whole on the flip i must say that 16b keeps many of the original elements that worked quite well on the a-side the beats are very similar as are the baselines however there is a noticeable increase in the mid range sounds and atmosphere not a bad mix by 16b but one could blame for asking for something slightly more diverse then the original mix overall it s quite a solid release for the ever consistent sex on wax label with 2 pretty solid productions that offer very smooth chunky house

what makes a good disco edit we might hope to hear something more than just an extra emphasis on functionality some personality perhaps or maybe the fruit of some particularly successful digging or perhaps sounds that would be too rare to procure in a cost effective manner otherwise japanese record fiend s first volume of edits for italys glenview records inc certainly feels like it stemmed from some serious time spent in the crates what made it onto the 12 inch beefed up slightly extended sides from the latter portion of discos pinnacle sounds pretty great too in terms of value and rarity though is a bit of a wash: using discogs as a guide none of the inclusions look especially pricey or hard to come by and this editor doesnt tweak the tracks out so wildly that the originals wouldnt do you just fine so take as a calling card of sorts for s dj sets if not a prompt to spend some time trawling through dusty vinyl yourself
theres a studied vintage sheen that coats the debut of michael rintoul the iridescent faux-script of his logo alone suggests much careful consideration of cheesy straight-to-vhs soundtracks and miami vice re-runs but similar to the electrofunk-indebted debut of kinnegos other young discovery space dimension controller rintoul succeeds in something more subtle and more significant than pure retro pastiche words like elegant and evocative arent usually easily applied to digitised harps and tinny handclaps but in the neon-lit noir world of rintoul finds beauty in the singular sound of fairlight-era synthetics echoing the blush of the title washes of reverb and layers of talkbox vocals flush with luminescence and blanch to barely-there ambience and could easily slot alongside the calmer moments of jam city; they lack his grimy druggy edge but share an ability to penetrate a purpose-built urban pall with the barest of beat sketches guitar chords plucked strings and synth choirs radiate from the core of mitigating its juddering sub-bass and the talkbox harmonies of are positively upbeat in comparison and are particularly memorable forming a hot-blooded intermission of break-up tears and make-up fumbles set to snaky slow jam grooves the two minutes of are split between a hissing analog interlude and a brooding mood piece that ought to be the theme song of the rain-slicked film that is seemingly concocting in his imagination is a striking debut for the young glaswegian and one that becomes more involving with each listen its also a hats-off moment for kinnego head boxcutter although he may only curate occasionally for his passion project label he always seems to do so smartly
under his own name and in projects like scuba death and perispirit brazilian-born boston resident has quietly released a stellar run of albums over the past few years his work displays a knack for intelligent sound design and engaging environments that brim with synthetic noises though never one for aggression in his music donoso opens his latest album with an explosive gesture that sounds like a cleaned-up dusted-down version of a tim hecker climax but s distortion and grandiose tendencies never feel particularly powerful its an attempt to burst out of the blocks with captivating sonic gymnastics but it sounds like a dolby surround sound ad all bluster no danger this initial shortfall colours the rest of donosos history of scoring audio/visual works best captured on his 2014s a song for echo plays a big role here tracks often feel like background music from a video game bubbles like a first-person shooter and is frozen like an rpgs ice world penultimate track is a welcome break from the half-baked tension that pervades the rest of the album allowing for a brief but bright polyphony that feels radically different its the one time the music breaks the surface and breathes in some air has the shape of drama but not the heart of it thing about it never sticks maybe its the sounds which seem a little lifeless and a little constrained re is no danger of them breaking out of their lanes spilling into each other or causing any kind of rupture re are neatly delineated paths for each melody and rhythm to follow and the results are all too stately textures can be pretty in places the rhythms interesting but they dont feel like theyve got blood in their veins for all the work thats clearly gone into something important is missing its title suggests the album is all about machines but its more of a middle ground machines put in service of human patterns made to reflect and reiterate traditional harmonies and structures sounds have no autonomy; donoso remains in unquestionable control at all times
for the 2nd release on sentinent label manager justin garrett has found the services of a bright new talent out of holland by the name of stijn halfens and his anigye guise he is joined by the audio architects who combine to deliver this new release called the original mix is first up and it really is quite a solid production it s a classic progressive production that builds and builds and gets better as it flows along very nicely thanks to a moody baseline and very nicely arranged percussion nice melodic riffs come in late in the track as does a nice subtle eerie effect quality stuff on the flip is a remix that unfortunately isn t as strong as the original despite this the track still does have some good points with a strong baseline giving it a good groove as well as the melodic touches that feature throughout look out for the a-side here as it appears we may have a new talent to watch out for in the future
the second in stefan goldmanns prototypes series s is yet another obscure record rescued from the dustbin of history and presented in a decidedly different context from which it was originally heard complete with a remix tacked on at its end by an avant-garde leaning producer (for the initial prototype release p p radock remixed pete namlook ) is one of the many musical identities adopted by composer stephen nester throughout the 80s a solo project abrasive tonal experiments and decidedly noncommercial instrumental electronics itself is a top-shelf sonic oddball summoning the great experimental irreverence that was the trademark of groundbreaking industrial-electronic acts like throbbing gristle and cabaret voltaire its a self-contained short film: an urban rainstorm police sirens a dark jazz-noir of wandering bass warble and evocative trench-coat sax then the raymond chandler motif fades out into a claustrophobic tunnel of overlaid radio transmissions and hauntingly warped vocal samples only to culminate in a coda of bass flutter and the deep-chested panting one might associate with the cathartic conclusion of some sudden unspeakable horror the other tracks here are visceral minimalist workouts mintas is a relentless two-tone resonant bonk-fest while in and a menacing cluster of aggressive analog-noise bursts has all the warmth of a haunted siberian oil refinery in both nester jacks into electronic musics capacity bare sonic assault the kind of hostile provocation that the gristle and others picked up from the dadaists and surrealists as ricardos role here what might on the surface seem like as likely as say the chance meeting of a sewing machine and an umbrella on a dissecting table turns out in practice to be a seamless intersection of older and contemporary creative energy the moody meandering of the original fits with silken couture precision into a distinctively skeletal groove the disorienting soundspace of spectral voices are here reduced to incidental cursory bursts in order to give things over to a pulsing bubbling mid-frequency ambient-dance remake of the originals dark fedora sonata while staged in one song a mini-three piece urban narrative of suspense hallucinatory climax and unsettling aftermath update sounds like an extended ride aboard the elevated train rattling across the background amid all the usual casual brilliance of ricardos production technique the sonic highlight here is certainly the beautiful layer of shifting hi-frequency hisses in which samples of rainfall become indistinguishable from layers of brushed cymbal taps as a whole the track follows a side-winding cinematic build that doesnt reach a steady handclap-centered groove until almost nine minutes its one of ricardos more free- m compositional ef ts and it recalls in a silent way -era miles davis in its lush organic atmospheres and limber burbling virtuosity makes one wonder what a minimalistisch tribute to lade runner might sound like seriously can we get this guy and lindstr m some soundtrack work
with last years visione steered his ghostly techno onto more varied terrain this single returns to firmer ground not only in style but by reprising one of shuttles bigger successes avoids being a tired rehash by stripping the original of its most recognisable element only allowing the vocal to surface as the occasional reverbed tone it acts just as another component in a piece of distilled psychedelic techno as fine as many shuttle has released the wandering modal melody that replaces it puts a gloomier slant on the tracks hypnotic groove on the flip s reverb haze and chirruping synths suggest nocturnal journeys through sinister jungle landscapes fter a while the quiet arp stutters are joined by thoughtful piano tinkles shuttle can make huge monochrome techno when he wants to but these daubs of subtle colour suit him best
is pretty much a byword for genre-hopping these days on his six-track ep daniel fisher adds breakbeats to his playbook with the same brio as his past experiments with jungle electronica techno and ravey house berlin-based american is also known for the fun he has on his records and it continues here from the punning title onwards you can imagine the grin on his face when he produced these tracks despite the warehouse-ready darkness of their ingredients title track sets the tone with a colossal distorted beat which fisher liberally peppers with drill-like flourishes and frantic cowbells a good deal of s fun comes from the drums is a straightforward banger before the beats grow squelchy and a ragga vocal appears evoking old kid606 spooky synths are fishers other go-to: the title track the rubbery clatter of and all feature eerie high notes standout has a compelling chug that sounds like it was recorded in a roaring gale a bonus beat version of further underlines the percussive focus of fishers impressive ep
as thomas mullarney iii and jacob gossett wrap their music in melancholic introspection that quality made the duos 2013 debut album the ways we separate sometimes feel heavy and dismal songs dealt as much with the sensual shapes of r b acts like the weeknd as trip-hops sleepy crawl s second album continues the move towards the dance floor heard on last years ep where the lyrical themes of the ways we separate dealt with distance and isolation mirrored in the musics sparse arrangements is preoccupied with time and entropy (the title itself is a reference to clock mechanics) set those ideas to music with increased energy drum bass in its lightest possible form gives a jittery sensation the breakbeats provided by tycho drummer rory oconnor hit pretty hard in youre ending the album with s version of a dance floor crescendo also suggests the duo arent strangers to club music with its clipped house beat and a structure that has more small peaks and troughs than their earlier tunes but if theres a new sense of release in s music the same cant be said of their lyrics a familiar atmosphere of heartbroken reflection and pent-up frustration prevails self-absorbed as they may sound these songs of love lust and loss can be affecting occasionally sending the heart aflutter with the same quiet trembles in mullarneys voice its a silken and seductive thing even making lines like no matter how i try to stop / it only gets worse sound like a come on if this is bedroom music though its the solitary kind at least with theres a sense of the world outside
first time i saw gavin russom play live as lack meteoric star it was boring sit-down affair that would have seemed academic if he hadnt been performing in a club year later he had transformed the set into a headbanging dance party that was one of the best live shows i saw in all of 2009 russoms new project takes the lack meteoric star evolution even further adding vocals and amping up the energy this second df single pops along at a breakneck 135 pm wielding a furious acid line for nearly 14 minutes tune is a tour de force and not just because its ridiculously long russom takes the listener through a few different movements sometimes were listening to a woman talking in spanish in time to the beat sometimes were treated to two-finger organ soloing that resembles the same sort of minimalism that he offered as lack meteoric star near the end we get what im betting is russom himself repeating im on fire over and over again heres hoping no one bothers to put him out for a while
soma has never been just a techno label looking back over years it seems as though scottish imprint has always retained and subsequently exhibited its desire for releasing music with a bit of adventure about it this year perhaps more than ever has seen imprint delve deeper than usual into that leftfield realm (look no fur r than the black dog for evidence) s continues this trend a rare release on label best described as dub techno with ep german duo follow a ra r strong line of dub cuts to have seen release so far this year they hold ir own just is a banger theres a short and heavy analogue bassline that controls show with a continuous loop paired only with a stifled kick drum theres no doubting tracks dance floor functionality and whispering vocals and clanging digital samples should keep most attentive headphone listener interested but in september of a year that is already looking like one of dub technos best it comes off a little flat rod of deepchord provides two reworkings (with one more to come in 2011 apparently as well) the first labeled mix extends original and takes it deeper eliminating thick bassline and chopping vocals to beyond recognition the second interpretation mix does away with whatever club friendly element first contained putting toge r a kick less excursion into tribal dub
youd be hard-pressed to find a better representative for dre skulls label than the new york-via-texas producer who plops dancehall ideas and sounds on top of rhythms that hop-scotch between house hip-hop and baltimore (hes also got a semi-secret alter ego where the tracks get even clubbier) cloud club is his most seamless genre cross-stitch yet the obvious hit here is which is based on a drum break that throws itself down a descending bassline before climbing back up with a triumphant chord progression its a deadly club tune that effortlessly switches from misty-eyed euphoria to down-and-dirty mayhem pulling in air horns and cheesy brass along the way (a dub mix removes the voice for those who find it irritating ) that same sense of trembling wonder permeates which squares the good-time melodies of dancehall (its a cover of sorts of 2007s riddim ) with trance motifs everything pitched-up so the track inhabits a candyland of chirpy voices and overdriven synths the other two are more in tune with the climate pulling grime into the mix is a canvas of watery splotches chanting patois vocals and pulled-apart breaks (and one hell of a synth lead) while brings in the fake brass of the vintage stuff and pumps up the drama more ryan hemsworth than wiley
when berlins killekill label first hooked up with over the internet the experience says the promo material was like meeting an old friend its not a surprising sentiment: with a prolific output stretching from the early 90s through to the present his name should be familiar to anyone whos spent time digging through the bins in the last 20 years or so this makes him a great fit for killekills relatively new sublabel house trax which as the name suggests evokes the dusty aura of the era from which yusufs earliest tunes came im his latest and the sublabels second release is nothing if not old school the title cut rattles with overdriven drum machines and a grimy undersampled vocal chop ffodils offers the sort of quasi-tongue-in-cheek cautionary tale green velvet used to bring to the dance floor over stomping basement beats both are quite fun but the records at its best when it calms down a little the soulfully meditative ll with intricate keyboard work and airy atmosphere has an appealingly light touch nd the digital-only inclusion bring you techno is no throwaway: splitting the difference between the eps hefty and placid moods it stands to do subtly intense work in an up-tempo set
the first time i heard s was at fw gt; gt; the seminal club night run at plastic people home to possibly the finest sound system in london when its tuned and tweaked properly jackmaster dropped it fully testing the regularly assaulted bass bins and confusing the ear drum responses of every regular ravegoer there the tracks main ascending riff is of anthemic proportions squeezing synths basses and pads wobbling up; and then all the way back down before the process begins all over again with a new sound or squiggle making the same journey was born to test systems and stop dances dead nd when you first wheel it out it does just that; and it does it incredibly well; combining the outrageous dubstep bass wobble with the new contemptuous breed of bastard house music thats infecting pirate radio waves comes from the combined hard drives of label leaders rackles and s if to match the bonkers lead line of s drunk as hell wobbler they unleash possibly their most gloriously demented work to date fusing snatched samples of strings lounge pianos and mutilated synth riffs with tough constant rattling snare drums they manage to perfectly back up the tempo and dance floor workout of the side
the last time we saw jersey-based analog-house outfit they were self-releasing a gritty bit of slow-mo sleaze called the six an ostensible ode to the thrills and spills of public transportation like its predecessor handily captures a spirited meeting of old school and new school vocalist joey washington who cut a number of memorable tracks on strictly rhythm in the early 90s rekindles his collaboration with the group and the deployment of vintage gear in bonky drum patterns and analog swoosh feels simultaneously retro and edgy the biggest difference is that stallone have cleaned up their act for the better sounding certainly poppier but also generally more streamlined and focused and showing a more judicious use of embellishment exudes the off-the-cuff charm of early vocal house with washingtons falsetto bobbing in and out of a winding groove composed of fragmented disco drums and fuzzy synthesizers and its agreeable feel-good nature make it about as easy to resist as free beer no s remix is both sexier and dancier yet they manage to maintain the originals rough appeal: both the bass and the big bright synths have a rowdy hand-played feel to them mugwumps remix comes off shined-up and sophisticated with a round dubby low-end and classy piano chords a tuxedo and martini version where the original sticks to hi-tops and hot dogs washingtons voice sampled and replayed in angelic chords is a nice touch the last remix features another old-new team-up in the form of stallone mastermind arbarosa together with washingtons old strictly producer paul scott a cranked-up tempo and a bricklayer rhythm section all chunky drums and slap bass provide the backbone of the tunes heaviest rework turning the originals hang-out vibes into disco carthasis
t the end of 2015 a new record store called opened on a quiet street in kreuzberg berlin selling ambient jazz and reggae along with the usual house and techno since then theyve expanded their operation to include a label records which over the last year reissued two scuzzy gems of underground club music: dj doves god o mighty and instincts mindsearch now theyve moved into the realm of new music with an ep by sex tags cofounder dj fett burger (listed here for some reason as ) having said that the best track here is not exactly new j vla is an extended take on a remix fett burger did last year of a track called speil-egg a fine bit of modern disco by the norwegian artist olefonken whose misty pads might be the only thing that made it through to this version it makes sense to give this track a proper -side release long lazy and kick drum-free its a near-perfect manifestation of the balearic kitsch thats a cornerstone of fett burgers sound complete with psychedelic hand percussion and the sound of the surf rolling in the b-side offers more straight-forward club jams n y is a sunny house track with the kind of winding unpredictable arrangement thats becoming a fett burger hallmark (a la his remix on club no-no from last year) the stripped down version does pretty much what it says on the tin s dj tools theyre nice enough but after that ultra-lush -side you might wish they had more of fett burgers offbeat flair

sound like they are enjoying themselves during this stop-off at a chance et-up between m and andy with label boss jamie russell at space two years back has culminated in this ep of analogue funk and bass-drizzled house with a decidedly old school nuance lets make this clear this isnt ga in big room mode although co s closest morphing midway from its bouncing b-boy origins into italo house complete with ham red pianos me is a more understated affair all hissing percussion parping bass echoing handclaps and musical tics like an oddly-strangulated cowbell the quaintly-titled settles into a deep plink-plonk groove early on and stays there around which ga build fuzzy hi-hats linn-style drums and a beat that sounds like its rattling your mums best china luv opens with doleful dubsteppish swells topped by a pitched-up vocal sample but then in saunters in-period keys that bubble about with a pop and ping rather than a case of big boys trying to show off all their weapons to a young label no knock proves that are just as happy being foot soldiers
is labeled a dub techno producer almost as often as hes called a deep house producer and those arent two genres usually mistaken for each other ut one listen to a track like makes it clear where the confusion comes in sputtering to life on barebones percussive elements subsists on a single chord that sounds like a sawed-off accordion as weisemann orbits earthier elements around it: bongos finger snaps and a gently slicing kick actually initiate the tracks graceful ascent the chords fragmented and unpredictable stutter is reminiscent of rendon moeller but all bets are off when the rhythm section dissolves and makes way for a stirring string section rewired completely the chord progression maps out a firmer more resolved course and its all manner of cheek-caressing bliss as a piano floats in to complete the stunning arctic pastoral less emotional bobs on a dubby skank and finds melody in delayed echoes and outbursts the repetitive reggae ripple proving hypnotizing as solid bits of wooden percussion worm their way out of the tracks constantly melting core quite similar to his previous releases on the label that has arguably housed his best material these tracks are icier sparer as if clouds have rolled in on weisemanns otherwise imperturbably gorgeous world maybe its the influence of more self-serious projects like the ambient piano experiment of his xine album but you wont find the disco inflections of kiss of bana here however the core of weisemanns sound hasnt changed all that much and that the erlin-based producer can still make such brilliant tracks out of the same building blocks hes used for years is beyond reasonable expectation never mind that he employs the most saccharine and obvious melodies and new age sounds without provoking the ever-present cynic we all have buried deep within: weisemanns techno wizardry remains all his own and his greatest feat is not the blurring of genres but making them seem immaterial in the first place

ralph cumbers the bristol artist better known as bass clef started the project as a blank canvas for modular synth doodles on his own magic + dreams label but something odd happened along the way just as his usually danceable bass clef releases have become dense and tangled the material has grown clearer and cleaner like he finally wiped the eraser dust off his scribbles some friends i lost to bedlam others i abandoned re completes the transformation taking techno as its muse and delivering 40 minutes of pitch-perfect modular play landing on some friends is the most widely-available release from yet and it comes with a newfound focus on melody and composition cumbers has a tight grip on his machines weaving space rock melodies on and emphasizing the unique textures of modular synthesis magie moves like an organism that lives breathes and grows at their most basic these songs develop through the modulation of sounds that dance and jiggle across the stereo spectrum but they feel practiced rather than improvisatory over its second half some friends wobbles in the direction of techno albeit the cosmically-inclined kind nine-minute closer this does it best loading up a sturdy foundation with seismic pulses and erratically twirling synths it has all the brazen unpredictability of a live jam but it squirms in place as if pinned down by cumbers own hands swarmed by angry tea kettle squeals is driven by a zig-zagging bassline like shackleton in slo-mo as with bass clefs recent material on pan some of these tracks (especially the drexciyan depth charge of and ) could work on an open-minded dance floor album is short digestible and split into two neat halves without a wasted moment this above all is the hallmark of cumbers recent hot streak: the more out-there he gets the more confident he seems in his surroundings some friends he sounds right at home

some people are just insane collaborators take sascha ring the dude your ipod knows as pparat: literally everything the guy touches is way better than it would be if the other artist had gone it alone if i was building a house or making a sandwich i would totally want pparat up in it being like definitely put crown molding on the kitchen cabinets man or like whoa buddy dijon im pretty sure you want english mustard there ring just seems to know how to bring out the best in others to wit: his collab disc with ellen llien orchestra of bubbles showed us a side to everyones favorite berlinette that was warmer and sexier than she usually allows likewise pparats bff track with luomo off last years convivial revealed a sasu ripatti that was pleasantly conventional comfortable working within an almost verse-chorus structure with vocals that had time to breathe before getting chopped into wisps of syllable vapor enter the name given in to the pparat-modeselektor team up first seen on 00 s glitchy uf kosten der gesundheit courtesy of bpitch now after what the accompanying press release claims was a battering of verbal abuse ring has reunited with fellow krauts gernot bronsert and sebastian szary for a self-titled full-length the music that pops out the other end of the sausage factory is messy at times grating but for the most part a tour de flavor worthy of the english mustard opener is a warm chromatic splash that keeps adding the right bits until its ready to explode with stomping rhythm and brassy synth pulp soon after takes the same set of tools and sinks them to compelling benthic depths sounds more like what i expect from modeselektor: dubby beats grime-smeared vocals from old-school basic channel accomplice st emerging from the shadows all cartoony batman posturing not too much substance benefits from pparats sense of mature texturing but still not much in the repeat listen department here later tracks like no and with (with vox from someone named eased who is apparently famous in the fatherland for being in a band called seeed) show the tug-of-war between pparats minimal embroidery and modeselektors pirate radio shenanigans sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt and frankly its mostly both compelling string loops battle with canned dubstep gestures and oftentimes both sides sound weaker for it sheds the fat and finds its stride in a huge way laying down a foundation of martial drum loops and a lapping wave of white noise under a soaring sky mansion of far-off vox and strings the last 0 seconds dissolve into an unexpectedly moist digital realm the whole thing is the balls lbum closer of pickpockets a burial bass-drum stumble and rides it to moantown on pparats own wistful musings of (what sounds like) we were pushed into pieces / we were scattered into the night comes across as a bit of a thesis statement-cum-apology for the record is a collision of two somewhat incompatible aesthetics it is a marriage of varying levels of maturity and volume sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt my bias rears: i think pparat makes much smarter music than modeselektor; however there are times when he certainly benefits by getting his hands dirty with party music fans of happy birthday will find this disc a little self-serious and boring like a lecture on semiotics and fans of walls will be like kids keep it down its a weeknight but if youre somewhere in the middle like er a moderate might be porridge thats just right
sebastian mullaert began an especially prolific streak just over a year ago when he announced a new alias and label called the swedish producer and minilogue member made sure to explain in his announcement that meditation improvisation and dance would be integral components of his upcoming music and that way of thinking bled into his outher work last years collaborative album with eitan reiter reflections of nothingness was remarkable for its looseness and extensive scope and his upcoming live mix with ulf eriksson seems poised to bring that vibe to the dance floor it all illustrates how creative this mindset is for mullaert 13 months after 01 was released its follow-up has arrived without skipping a beat these three deep nuanced tracks range from 16 to six-plus minutes in length and mullaert doesnt waste a second his textures pads leads rhythms and samples are in constant motion and frequencies often materialize from the ether to sound as if theyd always been there and could conceivably and rightfully go on forever folding together their melodies and nudging their grooves until all possible configurations have been exhausted its immersive stuff and likely to bring to mind voices from the lake or even a seminal ambient/techno shapeshifter like gas mullaerts improvisational touch gives 02 a candid edge; on-the-fly mixing and sneaky micro-experiments feed the palpable tension of music being realized as you listen in that respect may be the least satisfying though only because theres less ground for it to traverse due to its dense ambiance still taken as a whole the record continues a thoughtful thread of techno teeming with life

terms of releases has kept pretty quiet the freerotation resident hadnt put out a record between 007 and this summer when let two of them loose in quick succession as the names suggest and subtitled coffee skits and waiting weather respectively work as two halves of a whole drawing out a nuanced sound on the edge of house techno ambient and experimental music the tracks feel warm and familiar even if they dont sound like all that much out there is marked by tension on the synths make toasty analog buzzes but the chords they carry are dissonant and sustained for uncomfortable stretches while drums shuffle aimlessly and the bass climbs up and down an uncertain scale is too slow to be proper techno yet too bleak to be much else its incessant drumming and muffled melody evoking a low-flying helicopter circling your neighborhood the oppressiveness lifts on where bubbly percussion pushes through ecstatic shimmers of ambience then folds back in on himself for though theres playfulness in his paranoia his half-step rhythm shuffles perfectly and his synth melody distorting and flanging in slow-motion over the course of the track hits all the right notes saved the best for last though from the off is brasher nervier and more assured with an even broader range than the twirl of synths on draws you up but the churning bassline pulls you down; hearing it loud is like watching your last breaths bubble toward the light as you sink to the bottom of the ocean invokes jazz sort of: drops syncopated rhodes chords between loose drum hits while a pitchy synth-stab blinks like a short-circuiting beacon recalls joey erson in its low-pitched wriggly melody and spaced-out sound design but the restraint is uniquely s the ep closes out with where the sound this producer has spent two -inches building seems to evaporate heres hoping it fades into being again very soon
cheekily describe lets go the -side from their fourth self-released ep as a crossover mega hit and in an ideal world this twisted italo-gabber anthem would be racing up the charts as we speak in reality its clearly aimed at the industrial techno dance floor where its preposterous theatrics supply a jaunty counterpoint to the sturm und drang found elsewhere its a sound that this pair of anonymous former uk garage producers (well thats the story anyway) have been working towards for a while re was me from from 002 ; then fash from 003 which sounded like a redlining new wave instrumental but here the stiff europhile synths and white noise washes reach even gaudier heights past releases have been solid but this is their first moment of brilliance tracks on the b-side are more business-as-usual is a jackbooted stomp through 90s belgium while lurid synth etude of eats soul within this decomposing establishment pain nd suffering (bollocks custard wheres suet pudding edit) is presumably a skewering of technos recent taste for high-minded gothicisms s is often the case with these fellas it might be a pisstake but its also pretty effective on its own terms (even if they seem to have er left the clicktrack running)
its hard to underestimate the year that tim green had in : his single for trapez mr dry was a huge hit his remix of steve lawlers st century ketchup was the pick of the litter and he even started working behind the scenes with lee burridge on some material that is sure to see the light of day sooner rather than later green capped off the year however in a low-key fashion with an ep on the fledgling imprint has primarily been the home to julian smiths october alias thus far showcasing his melodic tech house sound and greens contribution falls directly in line with that style has plenty of melody in its percussion and plenty of melody elsewhere too in fact at times its almost too much to handle greens obviously a talented producer but on this track he mistakes complexity for quality its a trap that smith also falls into often too much attention here is paid to the arrangement at the expense of drum programming the beats are rounded off bulbous rather than hard-edged blunting their impact especially the comically undercooked hit that appears in the bridge markus drops by for a rework and strips things back to focus almost exclusively on the elastic synth that features in the original is equally as talented which is why its surprising that this mix doesnt quite work either: the melody isnt all that engaging and neither is s unadventurous drum programming whose sole moment of interest stems from a slight stutter somewhere around the four minute mark luckily green original saves the day its mildly quirky in the same way that the best material is taking more than two minutes to properly begin on however the wandering is purposeful allowing green to stretch out initially confusing themes until they slot neatly into place
consistency and a diverse but functional aesthetic have kept ahead most labels operating in the same space the labels latest 12-inch comes from romanians livio roby and george g as a joint alias theyve been sporadically releasing under for the past few years colourful and effective exemplifies the continued appeal as a label devoted to delivering vibrant cuts aimed squarely at the club the stomping kick drum and mellow synth stabs s get the ep going they only stick around for a short time though interrupted by a rousing spoken-word sample the releases second original sits on the flip and is loopy as they come bottom-heavy swung immaculately paced and with a charming vocal snippet you could feel confident throwing this in at just about any point in your set remixes come from sons of and avatism the former take the digital-only into spacier territory while the latter disintegrate s into a mess droning stabs
one of the more in form artists on the house scene has been and theu have a chance to showcase their talents with this two disc on nick k and matthew dekay s imprint the title track goggles is up first and it gets the ep off to a very nice beginning with a nice melodic and uplifting production thanks to some great melodies and a nice subtle vocal hook surprise us early by delivering a very tasty progressive cut here i want to see the sun again has a bit of a melodic feel to it with some very smooth melodic riffs that combine quite well with some smooth baselines and latino like guitar riffs the flow is again quite smooth and uplifting creating yet another pretty peak time track nasty kicks start disc two in a very nice housey way with a smooth baseline giving the track a very good flow the production is quite eerie in parts as well thanks to some interesting sounds and effects that subtly ride the production this is our land closes the ep off with perhaps the chunkies track off the lot thanks to some solid beats and percussion as well as a chunky driving baseline some interesting ragga style vocals also help make this an interesting end to a pretty solid ep by
swedens have had quite a year after their understated chart-topper girl from botany bay 2006 has seen mark henriksson and sebastian mullaert move from strength to strength producing a string of jerky minimal hits for traum crosstown rebels audiobahn and silver planet their latest for mathew jonsons label could possibly top the lot while the title nods towards dj kozes clubfoot elephants is not nearly so brash or artfully clumsy rather were treated to a typically polite intro of minimal percussive tics pops and seasonal sleigh bells before the rabbit is pulled from the hat in the form of wildly zig-zagging bleep lines with little or no melodic basis while the boom-chkk powers everything forward it s these bouncing tones that captivate like nathan fakes dinamo pushed down a helter skelter as these lurch in both pitch and timbre as though driven on l plates families of high pitched arpeggios offer further titillation over its 10+ never-dull minutes is even better built around an instantly intoxicating swollen low-end hook and an almost unvarying rhythm track it has the kind of restless motorik drive you could happily chug away to for hours the cry of real seagulls supply the track its title while synthetic duplicates take over the break but this is mostly about a winning riff and bassline joyously recycled a welcome update on the basic channel dub techno template another feather in s plume-heavy cap with excitement equally thrust at both head and shimmying ass
since 2011 french label has been establishing itself as an outlet for deep dark and conceptually-inclined club music this is mostly owed to polar inertia and dscrd whose intriguing electronics make up the first half of the labels catalogue but in the last two years the aesthetic has also been honed by other producers namely s co-founder fran ois x whos released a solo record and two different collaborations (one with opuswerk as hiss : 1292; the other a rather sharp ep with antigone) now the producers latest shows him further defining the labels artful balance between techno and abstraction eps a-side is the more compelling is a pumping club track with a sense of longing riding an intense throb that never steps outside its elegantly upwards sweep on the other hand is haunting cinematic ambience full of cloaked chords glinting tones and sub-bass on the b-side two takes on shadowy techno bring things back to the dance floor title track is a nimble but broody chugger with loops and chords that sound heavy and somber is just as driving but taps into softer more melancholic moods synth wails that start out in distress become subtly gorgeous the kind of layered emotion that gives this music its allure
if the name isnt a weed reference then the italian producer has inadvertently made it seem like one dona basile who has released records under other aliases since 2013 debuted his project last year with a record called hifi which was adorned with little more than a green marijuana leaf those big acid-touched drum tracks were no doubt smoky and blurred just like the one he released on unknown unknown a few months later but the third record for cr me organizations sublabel goes further into the haze old video game samples dubwise effects hulking junglist bass blown-out breaks and a beatless mono version of you could practically get a contact high listening to title cut is subtitled tribute 90s which is either a little joke or another sign of basiles blunted state of mind everything about these tracks sounds ripped from the 90s from the glowing rave synths and breaks worship to the casual way theyre recorded and mixed purposely derivative as it all is the music is irresistible oozes atmosphere even as it drops blistering bass weight and goes wild with yappy samples while does much of the same swapping the euphoric pads for gritty street fighter clips only verges on overdoing it taking on more rhythmic patterns samples and synths as it shimmies forth climaxes are a bit messy but in the thick of the clutter and old-school references theres a heart and soul thats hard to deny

is the debut offering on underl_ne s new sub-label the brainchild by troy pierce underl_ne is one of the better new minimal labels with releases from pierce himself under his louderbach alias as well as a host of up and comers is drawn up along the same lines: primarily as a platform for new unknown artists to get their music out and into the crates of djs this first release comes from aka tokuto da a japanese dj and producer now residing in london the press release cites mike ink and fumiya tanaka as two major influences and this clearly can be heard in the four cuts found on this ep all are stripped back minimal numbers with glitches beeps squeaks cut up samples and an array of other effects bouncing over deep basses the four tracks really feel like variations on the same theme and all suffer from a similar problem to put in bluntly they just aren t that interesting the minimal cut-up glitch funk is aiming for is a very tough sound to pull off and he doesn t really do it on most of the tracks the closest he comes is on the a2 deep therapy which a good funky number in short has set himself a difficult task with this ep by choosing a sound that is really hard to make work the results are very mixed and the only way these tracks could really be effective were if they were used in ableton or a similar tool to give them a bit more oomph
the darkness in s techno is well-earned the french producer has long been interested in e m fusing the two genres for dj hell in the early 00s and forming a group with nitzer ebb vocalist douglas mccarthy soon after that in working with a singer though fixmer also has had plenty of experience with the dynamic tension between clean and dirty the push/pull of dank background and bright foreground you can hear both at work on the first official ep in advance of fixmers newest full-length his debut for speedy js imprint the repeated melody in is a squealer the sort of fire alarm bleeps that only make sense as pleasure within the context of techno despite the elements it bounces like a chicago house track but youd be forgiven for not noticing: someone is saying something like the title of the song in a masked voice that is pure techno the clean edges of a-side are almost too perfect which makes planetary -side remix almost necessary you can hear the core of fixers hypnotic and buffed original but only once youve burrowed down beneath layers of grit
it seems like its so much harder to be taken serious or taken legit said seth troxler in ras latest between beats film produced with his sometime engineer phil moffa might not represent the zenith of troxlers career but the warped witching-hour atmosphere the duo summon is some pretty serious business this is especially true of which begins with a hyperactive kick pattern before the americans increase the pressure with a nagging refrain that sounds like a nest of rattlesnakes it becomes darker still an ice-cold wind blasting through it before an operatic voice and portentous strings provide a further twist its like some deranged electronic version of a bernard herrmann soundtrack juddering techno of sounds straightforward in comparison but theres still time for troxler and moffa to disfigure it with alarm pulses and jangling synths at the breakdown troxler doesnt get to spend much time in the studio these days but this creative relationship with moffa is definitely worth further exploration

the samurai family of labels has become beloved for its turn away from standard drum bass especially via the adventurous (and excellent) horo imprint but one thing that gets overlooked is how great a source of dance floor drum bass the main label still is its traditional compared to something like horo though never boring or safe as part of an ongoing effort to streamline things samurai folded its other drum bass label red seal and relaunched its main platform theyre beginning things with homemade weapons a rising star who exemplifies the ethos: sleek clever drum bass that sounds modern but is orthodox enough to play at the average friday night at fabric on the seattle producer pairs with another west coast stalwart sacramentos red army the two go together well where homemade weapons prefers his beats clean and contoured red army likes to embellish them with big pools of reverb and dramatic chords the result is drum bass that feels perfectly sculpted and mysterious they work with a post-rock level of dynamics and precision all the drums in and are fastidiously designed heavy like anvils but never leaden and the arrangements are so taut they could snap the breaks return on the eps strongest track where theyre wielded like a spiked flail everything here is primed for attack but the duo arent aggressive about it preferring to marinate in the tension they tease out exactly what can make drum basss utilitarian repetition enticing instead of numbing which is a good way to describe what does as a whole records like likely wont grab fans of samurais more esoteric leanings but its not meant for them this is pure drum bass of the highest order
ir name might nod to new york city but 6th borough project are as scottish as a deep-fried mars bar scotland has long had a taste for the house and disco flavours of new york consider the glasgow nderground label the subculture nights or honeycomb club in edinburgh where craig smith one half of was a resident dj for ten years deed most of ss second lp would nicely soundtrack one of those parties: the sexy bassline of to oil up the dance floor the bump of f e e l just enough to keep the stragglers there is an album of slo-mo grooves the kind of thing andrew weatherall plays at his a from outer space nights and that bill brewster showcased on last years late tales like brewster clark in particular is an avid crate-digger as we saw on his 011 album of disco edits reekinstructions and snippets sliced from dusty old vinyl are draped across this lp you might say that s progress as a duo has the same crawling pace as their music nothing on would sound out of place on their 011 album one borough crisp beats and odd splashes of strings all turn up like clockwork granted this gives subtle shifts such as the way the bassline kicks into action on s a power that would be lost amidst more cluttered production like a hypnotist swinging a watch before your eyes they can easily lull you into a blissful state
the first track from five elements pt 1 has a pitched down bruce lee sample: empty your mind be formless shapeless like water house music of and (aka jan schulte) follows this advice with adoptions of new age and breakbeat with percussion that drips rather than thumps ep is fluid and fun chants and damp keyboard leads steer s bass and hand drum led rhythm while combines rave chords and croaks in a way that reimagines a dance floor as a cartoonish botanical garden two versions of falter schulte is usually a natural with chimes and birdcalls but the bufi mix is a touch overdone some instruments especially the ripe bass synth are too forceful like using a hammer to knock in a thumbtack n dub also has its gaudy moments a pan flute gets a lusty workout but its undulating arpeggios and scattered drum breaks gel more gracefully s skeletal array of chants grunts and breaks has an even better command of rhythm
the first an anonymous vinyl-only release quickly burrowed its way into record bags it had a simple but effective concept: take a rinsed-out trance anthem from the 90s or early 00s slow it down and slap a breakbeat on it you get trances epic euphoria without the dated qualities that turn modern listeners off somewhere between shed and evian christ that first ep had a slow-burning rise to fame culminating in a new live set from ejeca the producer behind it the second ep shows that theres life left in the formula even if it doesnt reach the dizzying heights of its predecessor an intense track like mauro picottos lizard which ejeca edits on the could be hard to swallow but he wisely homes in on its feel-good breakdown while slipping in a shed-style breakbeat on a rework of freefalls skydive (i feel wonderful) ejeca tiptoes around the cheesy vocal instead fixing on a buoyant arpeggio it turns the original on its head while keeping its bubbly disposition intact and the heart-in-mouth breakdown is the icing on the cake ejecas version of yves deruyters back to earth is the most radical transformation yet he splits the difference between trance and contemporary techno shifting the originals throbbing drive into a droning bass-heavy stomper that leaves taking on mobys go which strictly speaking isnt even trance for the records least imaginative effort but throughout the rest of ejeca makes an odd side project feel like much more than the sum of its parts
bj rn torske is the man so says fellow norwegian todd terje who switched him onto disco back in 1999 here terje returns the favour as one of three producers getting to grips with tracks from kokning torskes album of last year tt takes on frika not in his spangly disco pants but by taking it down to copacabana in a pair of tight speedos here its sets to a twisted samba rhythm complete with authentic cu ca percussion parping horns and a vocal slice from mas que nada for added nuttiness the horns eventually settle down into the refrain from lil louis french kiss honestly you sense the idiosyncratic terje has a kindred spirit in dj harvey the balearic colossus clearly enjoys himself on adding his unhinged vocals to a remix that sprinkles seagulls over the top of some gently throbbing disco-tinged electronica s ever with harvey it really sounds like no one else out there mid such competition crimea could have crumbled but instead the italian duo deserve a commendation for keeping up with the jones (and harveys and terjes) with their chugging kosmiche nu-disco take on
may not yet have become a fashionable italian name to drop ala donato dozzy but hes cut from similar cloth and produces similarly otherworldly music the essence of which is captured as much in the space between the beats as those beats themselves from a djing standpoint using music like this is all about creating a mood which makes a track like a piece of militaristic ambience much more at home in a club than anywhere else with its marching unrelenting beat it weighs in at almost twelve minutes and as such is perfect to drift in and out of the mix of course digital djing makes this an easy task and length is unimportant when one uses files and loops; vinyl has to be the medium that this piece and were primarily designed for is a much more tribal affair with a bubbling low end aligned with subtle percussion its got more going on than and is more evocative oth tracks are united however by a disciplined approach that results in a primitive trance-like atmosphere this is music that evokes the dawn of time as well as the end of the world deceptively simple approach is at work here but one heavy in detail and subtle distortion n intriguing balance of the abstract and controlled
last year ra hs fall of justice on morphine was a stand out record with its sinister jazzy edge now his label comes with just their second release since then the s if fall of justice was jazzy then this is just jazz first up is the title track a melancholy piece of downtempo dub with liberal amounts of sax its difficult to imagine dancing to this but of course thats not everything sadly though it strays a bit too close to easy listening at times with the impeccable production and real instruments washing away any sense of groove or rhythm you want to praise the process but the end result seems non-committal the next track is a little better its a tense and groovy piece of music thats quite cinematic it begins with jazzy chords and serious strings and like its dynamic as your average symphony its very far from the functionalism that usually characterises dance music but some may find it all a little directionless last up is ra hs remix of the title track he grabs things by the scruff of the neck and makes it a much more urgent piece of dub house bringing the tempo up and squashing the jazz-fest down to around six minutes however it still sounds a little unwieldy with so many sounds fighting for attention its blatantly clear that all the artists involved with this ep can make immaculate deep jazzy soundscapes the problem is they dont necessarily move the listener except perhaps on nd beautiful as they are you feel a remix could bin half of the sounds on offer here and make a leaner meaner record
now that her mum has reverted to popping round for a cup of tea in the morning instead of laying down tunes with her has had to seek out another collaborator on that means label mate who joins her on a wonky tribal-ish groove that has layers of disparate percussive elements competing with themselves lding the jerkiness of dancehall with deconstructed house its raw to the point of bloodiness goes solo on the eps other two tracks adopts a more traditional dance floor approach if could ever be described as such her vocal swirls around spitting hi-hats and snares that build ever agitatedly to an almost dubby intensity ut its the eps most discernible 4/4 moment that really grabs the attention she throws a pummelling bassline atop a piercing acid throb and galloping hi-hats incrementally notching up in potency its a thrillingly rudimentary tool that hops across the genres

s we know from his latest lp hardcourage never stands still for long with some nifty sequencing and a couple of standout tracks drew lustman made an album where coruscating pieces of electronica worked side by side with powerful clubbier cuts even if the overall impact was slightly fragmented on his first record since that album he looks to jungle and dub and the results are more muscular than ever the title track wields a danger vocal sample and some rough roiling jungle percussion but lustman also hints at dreaminess with tense pads and a silky bassline nevertheless its overall impact is blunt and forceful and no less enjoyable for its lack of subtlety rute is stronger with a greater sense of lustmans personality garbled and flayed-sounding its groove drifts in and out of focus like dance music only roughly sketched rute s main draw is the depth of its field and lustmans knack for bending the groove towards and then away from you by the time youve figured out where you stand in relation to it the tracks come to an end
uk heavyweights eats everything totally enormous extinct dinosaurs come together for which was produced exclusively for the latters recent get lost vi mix on beefing up the package is 4lux boss gerd who turns out two club-ready remixes original is an odd sort of record its intro sees a pumping kick play out beneath a patchwork of bleeps soft ripples and the sound of a woman drawing breath instead of the expected gut-wrenching bassline we get a set of solemn techno synths tracks composition is interesting even if its impact is slightly flat gerds interpretations are anything but sub tech mix builds a thumping intro before dropping into the infectious four-note lead line originals klaxon is put to good use adding flare to gerds tough groovy roll dub meanwhile drops straight into the action save for that feature its much the same track
unapologetically pro forma as it is drum bass has been an ideal outlet for it gives the londoner a rulebook he neednt fret over so he can get on with further refining the strongest weapon in his arsenal: sound design s expert way of crafting crunchy drums tactile atmospheres and formidable bass weight gives some extra mileage to the well-worn ideas on inversion his second 12-inch for quickly establishes inversion s mood after two minutes of eerie sci-fi ambiance clattering drums rise from the ether and a gruff mc (lifted from goldies sample archives no doubt) declares before the gnarled drop touching down its obvious is thrilled to be in this zone and that energy rarely falters soon after delivers burly soundsystem armament glazed with s charming deadpan but the song unexpectedly slips into nostalgic tedium halfway through when a sampled diatribe against tv culture drags on for almost three minutes working with lower tempos the vangelisian drift of is more engaging than s half-time bass swells and r b moans closer subtly updates a classic dubwise palette though the second half defaults entirely on drum bass tropes in favor of the producers own modifications as has explained his latest record is a nod to [the] sound of my teenage self and the conceit keeps inversion teetering between refinement and indulgence
heres a situation thatll be familiar to almost anyone with an interest in techno youre on a dance floor a few hours into a set you barely recognise any of the tracks playing but that doesnt stop you repeatedly thinking to yourself what is this mostly for me at least those tracks dont sound like much more than a kick drum bassline hi-hats and a flew bleeps which makes tracking them down almost impossible but these are the records many great techno sets are built on whether its marcel dettmann or dvs1 robert hood or r dh d quality tools form the basis of a master djs arsenal few people can pick out these tools like through his label the italian has released a trove of these understated weapons and the imprints latest batch comes from the studio of the founder himself compared to most dance music very little happens in each of s three cuts the two standouts are and the former is all bleepy keys hats and a subdued snare but somehow these elements combine to create true hypnotism throughout its six minutes the beat only gives way for two short moments making it a smooth ride from start to finish is a touch more energetic with bigger sounds but a similar palette stabs swirl around each other while percussion ticks along underneath again creating a disorienting but strangely pleasant mood another premium cut caps the vinyl off and though comprising similar parts is less colourful i believe is a timeless record but not in an obvious sense it probably wont appear in any end-of-year lists and there certainly wont be many people humming in a decades time but as long as techno is being played in nightclubs therell be a place for

quick whats the last thing youd expect from geoff the man who along with adrian utley and beth gibbons took a full 11 years to craft scupper and rebuild the third studio disc by portishead how about an album note that reads recorded live in one room with no overdubs or repair only edits to create arrangements all tracks were written over a 12 day session in soa studios bristol england given s perfectionist streak you might expect beak gt; his new goth-tinged trio with fellow bristolians billy fuller and matt williams to be pretty half-assed under those limited creative circumstances but if portisheads third was produced to within an inch of its life and worked magnificently for that reason beak gt; is reduced the same way and thats what lends the album its power this is haunted-house music an imaginary soundtrack to a cult horror movie that derives its dread entirely from its atmosphere no wonder it came out in england right before halloween kicks the album off with needling organ an ekg bass pulse and far-away awoo s a black-and-white nightmare whose reduced budget and one-take ethos give it an extra jolt even when things lighten up they stay ominous a couple tracks make overt nods to rock classics leads with a bass pattern reminiscent of talking heads psycho killer and ron rides a pulse straight out of neu s hallogallo but take them in more sinister directions: dwells on its repetition until it gets under your skin while ron crosses its krautrock beat with dubby echo and skinny analog synth meddling that recall the severest of circa-80 dark-sider prototypes even that corniest of traditional-prettiness sonic signifiers tweeting birds or at least their approximation via electronic means is the bed for the twisting and winding guitar-and-delay explorations of guerny is two minutes of guitar buzz and howl and squall as reminiscent of pan sonic as sonic youth while beak gt; s debt to krautrock and goth are obvious its less overly beholden to any one area than it might seem ts thrills are gaunt and hollowed out just like the last portishead album only without the comfort of layered production or gibbons maladjusted croon but it sounds more coherent every time play it just like the albums of s other group and maybe this ones no-frills approach will bleed into the work-rate of that one res hope in an album so seemingly drained of it
you hear a lot about how the internet has ravaged the music scene; how its killed physical sales cheapened the mixtape and enabled lazy bedroom producers with all the noise its easy to overlook the good it can do like plucking a 21 year old from small town germany and dropping him onto the debut 12 inch of a london based label raised from the multitude of aspiring soundclouders simon schilling aka ess y was first introduced by glyph back in january via the digital only that too was an internet marvel schilling doing over the panoramic ambient of a producer based even further afield new zealand this debut physical release from glyph presents four new tracks as well as offering on wax for the first time john talabot and tycho are two names the label has compared schilling to and theyre not far off the mark as talabot did with oro y sangre and tycho with hours the young german stands somewhere in the lush middle ground between ambient house and instrumental pop it canters on a gentle beat for instance at is subdued and atmospheric a feeling further enhanced by its meek bells and smudgy chords at channels a similar vibe threading sky sized gaseous synths around muffled piano as they press upon your ears with weary optimism both cuts seem to demand headphones and a comfy chair a collaboration with t is similarly emotional convincingly inducing nostalgia whether the title/idea came before or after the music is unclear but the tracks honeyed synths and homely beats render it as comforting and familiar as the previous two
milo smee launched his bintus alias and label in 2012 starting a new chapter of his career his absurdist rave hybrids have since gained recognition among a new generation of techno fans with a taste for the harder stuff but the other masks smee has worn over his two decade career were never going to stay hidden for long this is one of two new eps as kruton a name that has graced weirdo records for mark brooms pure plastic and andy blakes dissident it excavates smees hip-hop influences and does so by going to the source ep features rapper sensational whose bizarre and grisly 90s work on wordsound typified the leftfield spirit captured by early kruton new york rapper has since collaborated with a range of electronic musicians but rarely have these collaborations met sensational so close to his own turf largely comprising boomy hip-hop instrumentals produced back in krutons early days builds an intriguing bridge between old and new sounds are mostly live damp breakbeats played on a bedroom drum kit oily bass guitar and arranged into oddball loops over the top a reverb-fogged sensational focusses on style rather than content his lines shuffle crabwise over the beat switching between hip-hop braggadocio and something more unhinged he often riffs on the dance floor context of smees music : watch the party jump / beat bump followed later by the weirdly compelling refrain darlin im taken / im not into fakin bacon / cake cake release is crowned by its most substantial track it comes in an original version whose menacing house trudge is softened with forlorn melodies in the latter half but the updated version is the head-turner splitting the difference between old and new the tunes loping halftime is rendered with bintus-style ten-ton drums harried by angry synth lines and the odd rave chord once sensationals had his say the drums reform into a chunky 4/4 stomping gleefully into the present day
after an album (the white denim release scared ) that took his slow-motion gothed-out house dirges to new extremes of narcotic torpor viennas appears on the new l a label with a positively sprightly acid number this time there are no pitched-down leonard cohen vocals or death-gurgle bass notes: from the beginning the groove is given an upbeat push by clipped sampled congas (shades of new orders the perfect kiss ) alongside crisp drum machines tight delay on the acid bassline meanwhile keeps things tumbling forward while faint but pointed chords egg it all on expanding the harmonic dimensions of the track still theres an undertone of sadness: what takes from acid isnt its squelch but the innate melancholy in its drooping pitch bends donato s remix of excises the congas and suffuses everything in a layer of echo and fuzz flipping the originals perky outline into a wearier shape towards the end he unleashes a beautiful sequence of tones some incidental synthesizer puttering away far away in the distance; they flare up and are gone before you even know it but the whole mood of the thing has changed however imperceptibly on takes the acid line from and etherizes it slowing the tempo to 75 pm and concentrating on the frequencies that emerge from the lengthened decay time fleshing out the spectrum with synthesized strings and real-sounding clarinets it sounds like a combination of vintage plastikman and aphex twin trippy and bright-eyed all at once as naive as oards of canada on a cloud-watching jaunt after the anti-gravity anomie of space case on his last album its almost a relief to find out that can be such an unrepentant softy
re are times when dance musics habitual manipulations of the human voice can come off as probing and significant and genuinely philosophically profound; there are also times when the same can be just altogether too embarrassing to want to acknowledge or even bear but it must be done or at least cant be resisted and it shouldnt either: who doesnt love or maybe even need some embarrassingly tacky and/or just stupid vocal tweakage every now and then but still: love u so by french-house icons is too much with its helium-pitched assertions of a love wholly unconvincing and its slapdash arrangement of disparate sounds that points to the fine line between disorienting collage and just plain grating pastiche remixes here are a mixed bag too bowskis 2 am remix slots the track into a tauter and tidier house format but doesnt do well by a spot halfway through that drops everything out in favor an acappella turn that falls disastrously flat a mix by skream goes for old-school hardcore mania with revved-up rave piano and a splashy breakbeat but it doesnt get much further than the mere idea of it from there love u so gets a break with the rest of this ep given over to a spacey spangly gesaffelstein remix of and as reimagined by l-vis mostly as strangely sputtering disco with sloppy drums
wolfgang and reinhard voigt two of kompakts founding fathers have maintained a refreshingly simple musical philosophy down the years every weekend says reinhard the good old straight bass drum still unites the people on the dance floor their latest contributions to kompakts speicher series are almost puritanical in their make-up straightforward ingredients sympathetically employed in the voigts take a rising shepard tone and deploy it like a cluster bomb its like an aural hotrod hitting its top speed before the parachute kicks in slowing it down to a mere murmur dials back on the beats its wheezing synths sounding like a cats fallen asleep across the keys it eventually welcomes in verdi-style violins and like the a-side its directness and lack of pretension are a big part of its appeal
ever since we stay together when his considered dub techno gave way to a more abstract and grinding sound listening to has been a bit like picking a scab or poking a bruise: it hurts so good his trio of releases in 2011 and 2012 which culminated in the universally lauded luxury problems assaulted the senses like little else thats even tangentially related to the dance floor as good as it was though the aesthetic felt a bit like house music passed through a filter if you could calculate the precise coefficients you could theoretically reverse the effects of stotts brutal processing and arrive back at relatively straightforward 4/4 the music on however is too far gone for such an antidote whatever malady infiltrated his sound around the turn of the decade has now completely reordered its dna resulting in the most fully formed and wholly unique record in his discography s like were listening to an entirely new organism formed from the sludge that slipped off his earlier tracks thats evident within the albums first moments it opens with spacious silence then a growl then a sequence of bone-chilling horn blasts they lead to a track cut from the same cloth as luxury problems but woven into a remarkably different form alison skidmore stotts go-to vocalist (and former piano teacher) returns here but rather than provide ethereal adornment to hellish house music she fronts a full-fledged song albeit one played with instruments thrashed beyond all recognition weaves between moments of compositional clarity and spooky ambience: clarion calls reverb tails and breathy pregnant silences stott pauses in murky interludes as he lurches between icy electro swells those telltale stutters are the albums closest link to the dance floor but while may be body music (in the broadest sense) it invariably favors dripping pulpy atmosphere over the vestigial pulse of stotts earlier work exemplifies this approach: though a small army of drums gallops beneath the surface we only hear the rattling of the metal wall they seem to be running into subdued pads carry the melody and while theyre quieter than the stomping rhythms they have the power to dominate the mix smothering us with sweetness even at its darkest and furthest out is as warm and engaging as albums that make standard inroads to listeners hearts the title cut matches post-punk electric bass with unflashy rhodes chords and a crisply vintage drum machine its an incongruously clean landing for a record full of dissonance and noise stott throws us one last curveball with a blown-out hymn of mile-wide bass scratchy strings and a vocal line that could have been recorded inside skidmores skull with one last distorted twinkle the album trails off leaving you battered and utterly certain youve heard some of the years most distinctive electronic music

its an open secret that techno labels like are gradually establishing themselves on a brand of techno thats often fundamentally retro even at its most futurist so open in fact that the label has plucked a track from 1999 for its latest release updating it with remixes by label head perc and forward directly referencing contemporary technos roots it shows that clearly not all that much has changed in the ensuing years s original does sound a little dated but its a fine track with every element filtered and flanged to oblivion smoothed off and given a sickly grey finish the track hurtles down a never-ending wind tunnel at a blistering 135 bpm as the dubby liquid chords undulate under extreme pressure by the time it reaches the final stretch its exhausting claustrophobic and unforgiving a perfect fit for but the focus of this kind of reissue is usually the remixes the precarious task of updating a quasi-classic percs remix is a bottom-heavy precision march bolstered with harsh frequencies and bursts of static like staggered gunshots faint snippets of the originals chord progression waft in like a fuzzy memory until it embeds itself into the tracks hurricane eye on the other hand and bearing absolutely no resemblance is forward s remix which channels through grisly pillars of oscillating white noise over a trembling needlepoint breakbeat the duos comparatively leisurely grind almost overshadows the originals relentless propulsion but the fact remains that as remixes neither producer does anything to particularly expand on berkovis original vision for a classic techno workout and a few worthy contributions from contemporary admirers however you cant really go wrong
did you ever notice how great 80s movies involve either a) scenes of riding downhill (the waterslide in goonies the mine cart and the inflatable boat drop in temple of doom the shield-toboggan in willow etc ) or b) some kind of transcendental motif of soaring through the clouds ala flight of the navigator (rad metallic pee wee herman-voiced spaceship ride) and neverending story (atreyu falcor ) its the second trope that interests abakus aka aka russell davies i try to create music that gives me the vibe those classic films gave me as a kid says the kinks offspring in the press release accompanying this ep res a graduate thesis somewhere waiting to be written about how coming of age 80s movies were either about being swept downhill in an adult world beyond your control or being lifted to great heights by a benevolent deity/flying guide/protector disc contains four mixes of the same bouncing mid-tempo winner first version is a radio edit with clean vocals and more subdued instrumentals second iteration mix) adds some laser to the synths and thickens the low end cuz like its a club mix yo third cut seems pretty damned close to the first disc ends with busier keyboard arpeggios and a melody that searches slightly further afield as such mix) is the pick of the litter digging in the childhood vhs back catalog for a palette of affecting images is nothing new in electronica god knows enough has been written about anthony gonzales exploration of john hughes zeitgeist on the latest m83 record but what really stands out on this quartet of remixes is the total lack of irony the innocence of the snapping snare and winged synths sweeping skyward its not the smartest or even the sturdiest techno but if youre looking for the sensation of i dunno riding your bike through the air in front of the moon with a friendly alien in the handlebar basket this is probably the ep for you

is right: ive never been to his hometown in ukraine and im guessing im not alone the citys wikipedia article weighing in at four paragraphs doesnt mention a historical event there more recent than the 18th century and its geographic placement about 129 km from sumy the oblast capital which again will be less than evocative for most makes me realize ive never been anywhere close to that said s varied and texturally complex take on house music is the sort of stuff that makes you wonder where it came from nd youve en an album that brings together reworked and previously unreleased material recorded between 2009 and 2012 finds the producer born mikhaylo vityk at his most intriguing cross the three 12-inches in this sumptuous gatefold vityk paints a wonderfully detailed picture of somewhere using the entire range of his extensive palette: slinky jazz driving house meditative experimentalism vityk certainly isnt the first electronic producer to work with such a range of styles but hes one of the few who sounds on top of his game with every single one vityks stranger material makes for some of the collections highlights borrows some of the titular duos drama and ambition but the plush lived-in production aesthetic is all s the airy jazz jam which at just shy of ten minutes comes in as a kind of time-stretched version of a floor-filler has plenty of crawlspace to get lost in even the collections proper club tunes feel abstract the title track is at once a driving acid cut and a blissed-out bit of balearica and a new album dub of 2011s knocks s sprawling percussion section out of time with its heavy bass rumbles s which spreads out across most of the -side is the track most obviously in the mold with hefty cymbal hits skipping over epic synth swells piano licks and a wealth of sonic detail its pleasures are more immediate than those found elsewhere on the record but theyre no less potent has crafted a wildly diverse yet stylistically tight album made for burrowing into it might not take you to but it definitely takes you somewhere
although hes now based in amsterdam christensens music seems to reflect his danish upbringing the typically scandinavian qualities of mood melody and drama permeate his work hes an intriguing talent whose music often sits between house and downtempo s voice a cracked slightly stoned croon is central to it all ts a primary weapon on the first half of setting the mood for a two-step beat to drop midway through accompanied by a funereal organ sun-flecked synths and a dusting of percussion heading down a quirkier path the beatless uses a milk bottle rattle as its rhythm to which christensen works in woodblocks and daft electronic squiggles is easier to engage with ts an elegant slo-house jam with quivering mournful synths doing battle with stabs of electro-funk keys of the two remixes acid s reworking of is the more in synch with the original adding celestial hums and some itchy snares meanwhile the jon remix of is the purest dance floor moment of the ep he opts to get tough with a locked-on deep techno groove placing it underneath slabs of s cut-up vocals
operating out of rooklyn singer-songwriter jesse oykins iii and producer melo- make distinctively soulful hip-hop that sits somewhere between early outkast and d ngelo ack in early november dropped the newly formed duos superb debut album zulu guru perhaps due to the south london label wanting to draw wider attention to the project a four-track ep featuring remixes by jacques and travis stewart arrived in december se two remixes will now be rereleased as a limited 10-inch pressing oth reworks are of the albums lamenting and unsurprisingly theyre very different resisting the urge to ramp the stems into a frenzy of off-kilter percussion stewarts version under his machinedrum moniker is a light stroll through the jazzier end of drum bass oykins heartfelt vocals are suspended above a gentle assembly of extended snare rolls and looping claps to fluid effect on the -side jacques continues his recent run of form by primarily focusing on the originals depth maintaining the plaintive tones and glacial feel the parts are lifted into a stirring cut of vocal-led deep house with a timeless feel
in the space of a week this month i interviewed gilles peterson and joey negro both times came up both times it was agreed that the record is absolutely amazing that grizzled disco nerds such as peterson and negro are stamping their approval on it probably tells you all you need to know but stopping there would be a shame: has a remarkable story behind it the single was recorded in 1979 in trinidad tobago by a group of local musicians and released on the obscure kalinda label it was a rare blend of r b vocals and weighty west indian bass backed with a cosmic instrumental vamp that lifts the track into the stratosphere midway through there was only one problem: the record failed to get distribution so no one ever heard it until last year that is when someone found a box full of copies in a trinidadian warehouse the folks at then reissued the record and here we are today the b-side lypsco is equally impressive combining synthesizer warbles incessant beats and a face-melting steel pan solo (its not often you get to say that ) you would have thought a record of this quality would have surfaced earlier considering the sheer number of djs actively digging for this kind of stuff but the story seems to add up was the only record ever made bar a vocal appearance on michael boothmans equally brilliant version of what you wont do for love this was the lot thats indeed regrettable as its one of the very best reissues in recent years

is a lot of things a genre ironist a gender jockey a genius debatably but subtle he is not on his latest ciao he waxes obvious about information overload all i feel is in this data stream / i see the eyes in the computer screen /misinformation is surrounding me / it brings me down im on my knees but the big joke is that song itself ( ) is frenetically overproduced mess of purple one invocations basement jaxx snipes and inch-deep pop profundity enter loco with a dub that doesnt even deliver anything close to the songs hook until about six minutes deep into the cut a persistent little string flick and some mechanically feisty bongos building to himself exhaling are all that remain now i love taking something overdone and underdoing it for effect but this is the remix equivalent of garfield minus garfield parisian mnml producer kaine goes the opposite route instead of dialing back s enthusiasm he organizes it what was funky and goofy on the original becomes all new romantic lush and dark james sontags beep-beep-beep refrain stops being a reminder of technological interruption and starts to be the sexy pulse of the cyborg nightlife the message is lost but who cares this b bangs rounding out the trifecta is chicken lips andy meechan pumping up the bass as the emperor the third remix foregrounds the low-end and buries under layers of hammond sediment and synth detritus the original hook is completely replaced with an ornate little kraftwerk confection that vibrates like taut bungee cords again little to do with the original but happily interesting in its own right points for the tribal drum breakdown three-quarters through is a man who knows his 80s and likewise these remixes taken as a whole honor that ethos if the original is a happily disorganized linklater movie of half-realized influences and references each subsequent take pulls out a thread and weaves its own thing with it loco s remix is down by law kaine channeled less than zero and the emperor took a piss-take at the last starfighter if those analogies mean anything to you you should probably grab this release pronto
joe moynihan established himself as one of the more unusual producers of modern grime influenced club music his stuff stands out for its naive simplicity paying homage to the melodies of video game music with more honesty than irony its no coincidence he called one of his mixes spa theres something relaxing about his palette of washed out watercolours and plinky synths but before he was moynihan was an ambient artist with a self released album and a stunning companion piece for truants his drifting melodies and haunting instrumentation felt barely distant like a recollection you cant quite dig out of your memory this was humble music that didnt make huge waves and then moynihan appeared to abandon the project to focus on now with a new release on is back and more arresting than ever as the title hints isnt exactly a proper album: it compiles remixes of other artists along with originals but moynihans approach is strong enough (and the remixes are obscure enough) that every song feels like his good examples of the formula include the ultra sad centrepiece rent which embellishes its central figure with implacable noises and field recordings moynihan takes a william basinski like zen approach letting one loop wash over you again and again focuses on a single motif but it feels like there are a thousand moving pieces underneath his two remixes of play with baroque instrumentation submerging the samples in waves of fuzz until theyre unrecognizable whats most striking about is how moynihan has grown from 2013s where that one followed a formula across its 16 tracks this goes down a few different avenues addition the usual meditative pieces there are powerful melodic tracks like piano on that one sounds like it was lifted straight from depeche modes never let me down again punching through the serenity before moynihan takes it back to the land of fuzzy memories pairs its icy strings with new age touches while his remix of s sublimates his distinct grime melodies into fog all that variety makes more captivating than youd think for a record with its hodgepodge provenance if nothing else the album highlights moynihans sturdy songwriting and ability to find weight in the weightless re are many moments when he savours the texture of a single element or wallows in the reverb left behind another for fans of this will be a nice surprise a chance to revisit an old friend and for fans of its a chance to hear a different side of moynihan not a major work yet hardly insignificant is another welcome peek into one of uk club musics most guarded personalities
moves into dutch arenas for its next release thanks to the duo of le ron yves eaux they deliver the pretty interesting that comes with an original and a nocando remix the original mix is first up and the result is a pretty gritty progressive track that flows nicely with some pretty strong drums as well as a deep driving electro type baseline that pretty much gives the track its drive from start to finish expect some pretty tough late night driving sander k type material the nocando remix strips the pace a little and turns up the heat in the funk department adding a funkier electro baseline to the play the track also features a pretty smooth uplifting breakdown midway in that is very smooth and a welcome addition not a bad release with a nice and gritty edge on the a-side and a smooth and funky feel on the flip </b
kevin griffiths vinyl only continues with the second of its nite trax eps welcoming label veteran and tsuba debutants s pedigree shines through on t applies all the broad sounds from his palette: understated keys brisk handclaps shuffling percussion and a windblown chord progression that shines amid vocal samples and a flickering pad each element is hewn with skill and care ts nothing new for but its a characteristically engaging journey uk duo s cant is a decent statement of intent contrasting the sides depth with jacking house thats enjoyably frayed at the edges with all the obvious building blocks effects washed chords twitchy percussion elastic basslines and an aviary of vocals they create a track thats free of the standard production gloss t sits squarely on the dance floor with its elbows out but still retains an individual character with a bright live feel
19 has been out in stores for almost 9 months now however as there has been no review of this amazing mix on resident advisor i felt it was time to whip up a few words as to describe a mix that can only be described as a masterpiece there really needs to be no introduction into the man that compiled this album as always seems to be one step ahead of any other dj this mix then in true fashion from diggers is one step ahead from any other on the market now what can be said about cd1 other than that it still remains one of the greatest mixes from this year if not ever from the amazing opening tune supplied by pole folder and cp entitled apollo vibes the mix delivers a journey that persistently builds to a the wonderful climatic ending that is rui da silva s remix of brother s love dubs 1-800 ming what goes on between the opening and final record can only be described as inspirational madam s penetration although quite minimal in it s approach is devastating in it s result 16b provides his magic with 2 remixes the first being electric tease your lovin and the second his heavenly reworking of jamez music tijuana s groove is in the air (simon pearson mix) has been such an influential record that months after it s release dj s all around the world still find it an essential selection in their mix it is clear to see that digweed has an ear for quality this mix may not instantly appeal to many but its magic lies in it s timelessness which is a common feature in any digweed release the tempo is raised just a notch in the second installment of this fine release jimmy van m provides the opener with sanctuary and the mix begins its voyage with white room s brilliant strapped dj gogo then provides a highlight with his genius percussive record adyssa the magic of james holden is in there with his remix of roland klinkenberg s inner laugh cass provides a progressive funk tune with genesis while voyager rework one by aria the mix then closes off as only can with dj remy s remix of salt tank s the energy for those that question s ability to provide an uplifting experience disc 2 of la should eradicate any such thoughts pure class and pure class is exactly what gu019 is from start to finish having had the pleasure of attending the launch party for this cd bedrock earlier this year it is apparent that not only do the records on this compilation have a meaningful effect at home but also they are quite devastating in a club there is absolutely no excuse for any house lover as to why they would not have this cd in their collection it is in one word perfect
releases from have been sporadic but noteworthy this year with efforts from midland and toby tobias particularly standing out the same goes for jozifs latest song and it is a song initially pairs swaggering kicks with tiny polite chords and rounded claps nice enough to be sure but the tracks real pi ce de r sistance is an arcing dramatic sequence of well-defined stabby strings and key strikes which swell the whole arrangement up to epic proportions in the spaces left behind a plump and lo-slung bassline gently wiggles its flabby behind and the pure vocals of terri walker are allowed to swoon and soar in a way that to me at least recalls classic kate bush elsewhere theres a dub which isnt a dub because it keeps the originals vocal instead drawing out a one finger tinkle on the ivories for its variation while the casino remix trims some of the dramatic emotional resonance in favour of dance floor energy importantly both versions allow the string centrepiece and sunset vocals of walker (which also appeared on t williams heartbeat in case you were trying to place them) plenty of room to breathe

you neednt be intimate with the separate discographies of jay ahern and stefan schneider as respectable as they are to enjoy in fact its probably best if youre not so you can approach this studio-based partnership on its own terms thats likely what the pair were angling for when they self-released their first set of recordings together in 2008 incognito with no titles or track names to speak of coupled with aherns hard wax affiliation you had a bit of a furore on your hands albeit in cloistered berlin techno terms they eked out a further two eps (they seemed to be and still are in no rush) before went on hiatus when ahern abruptly moved back to the states fast-forward to and the partnership is revived in force two years ago the first transatlantic record mixed from recovered tapes from the duos last session in berlin was released on aherns label modular cowboy soon followed treading that subtle line between thinking mans dance music and something more clubby working over dub acid house and minimal nodes with a distinctly machinist signature now seven years from when they began have emerged with a debut full-length for the eponymous label that started it all if youve been charting shadowy movements so far then youll be familiar with most material here as is mostly a retrospective affair with that in mind its a perfect introduction for the uninitiated while less interesting for fans in want of something new yet the full spread is present and its a delicate feast of idiosyncratic electronics the album begins for example with one of the b-sides from the first ep now called and despite the passage of time sounding just as cooly seductive and enchanting as it did back in 2008 there are also a number of fresh works here but for all the skulking witchy moments its the melodies that really stick like in (a rework of haunts from the 2013 modular cowboy ep) and in particular the sense of song structure acts as a reminder that these arent just jam sessions made coherent each one has been thoroughly edited saying that the residue of their loose and improvised origins are everywhere in the weird and utterly unique soundbites that make tracks like and stand out you can almost feel the geek-out moments when ahern or schneider made that sound stumbled across that sweet spot and just ran with it theres life in all 11 of these tracks strangeness buried within the layers but its far from alien dance music most of it would work in a club on a dark night deep into a long and druggy afterhour remains versatile just as long as youre ready for things to get a little warped
following on from ewan pearson cadenzas steps up for to mix volume 2 in its compilation series sci fi hi fi created using only vinyl and his bare hands the mix illustrates s raw talents as a dj kicking off on orange by d:uni:son the mix begins on a head nodding feel; intense electronic music drenched in melody rhythm and intimacy john thomas basilic ups the groove with its punchy vocal sample and choppy short chords while the intense whistle build up and chunky strips of clappy chords on tadeos bateria lup prove knows exactly what rocks big sound systems the world over the groove dips a little balearic courtesy of exercise by samim michal which revolves around a short vocal chant two simple sirens and some steel drum percussion by the time the dark ghostly samples and old electronic melody of serafins starship discotheque arrive is really working the speakers raises the stakes a little higher via soliebs lovesong with its twisted short vocal that transforms around a smouldering attack of samples chords and punchy synths later followed by adam beyers big plus 8 hit a walking contradiction the transition from the tech/house/minimal/slightly electro las velas no arden by alejandro vivanco into ricardo villalobos ichso is one of the finest mixes on the cd - crushed strings and hi-hats arouse the senses in a subtle manner as awkward guitar riffs run riot on the sound system towards the end teenage prodigy of sorts john dahlback lifts proceedings with a schism of minimal/electro before closes out with earth beats from mule musiqs kuniyuki a real epic number encompassing all elements of jazz afro latin drums guitars strings and all things quantised and raw for once this isnt a big f*ck off im riding my k-hole kind of final track sci fi hi fi vol 2 is all about rhythmic emotion plain and simple moody and percussive with hints of soul and intimacy the tracks from start to finish really push an optimistic feeling strung with passion and energy my only qualm is that there is no cd2 and despite the brilliant vinyl-only mixing i would like to have seen the use of additional dj technology to really highlight s considerable talents people will over analyse and pinpoint spots of irritant here or there but book yourself a night alone with a great sound system and thats when you will really appreciate this mix

omar-s must really like to fuck ut hey who doesnt his new cd on fxhe has an uncomfortably extended porno sample smutting up its third track and the -side on s newest 12-inch for the label pumps a naughty sounding vocal throughout its length as well in both instances the music would probably work well enough without it in fact fines jaunty keyboard line would almost seem welcoming family-friendly house ut there she is again taking the track in another direction its a push-pull that serves the whole thing well still doesnt make it less awkward to listen to in an office though on the flip the woman just comes out and says it: yo bodda all night long (just in case you were unsure she repeats this at least 57 more times ) fine uses divebombing synths to garnish a simple house thump and it makes all the difference: they warp the forward momentum giving curves to an already shapely figure
why are the vocals on techno tracks pitched so low ask marc houle for house music youll have to go to the infinitely stranger who pitches someone saying house music and everybody gonna rock the party vibe down to frigid depths in what must be the least uplifting party jam released in the track is called and like most of wruhmes work it sounds like little else wruhme has never been much interested in the way that his tracks will fit into any dj set other than his own wandering journeys thats why he can get away with the forlorn foghorn coda to s or s impatient electro with a delicate side its unclear what the hell is going on with at all nominally techno it sounds like a successful take on what wolfgang voigt was attempting on abweichung scattered drum hits and industrial blurts arranged into a satisfying whole still one of dance musics most entertaining and surprising artists wruhmes work here reminds us of what happens when artists stop thinking about the floor and start getting indulgent clearly we could use quite a bit more of that
the dusty loops and open-shirted facial hair and turned-out obscurities of latter-day disco revivalism have been used up pretty good over the past few years by pilooski and pentile so together they vow to move on you can sense theyre a little anxious the self-titled album by the duos working name is clearly cognizant of its own lineage the music is ultra-classicist: sharp and refined like chic robotic and romantic like early cajual subtle and user-friendly as early-80s post-disco and boogie but its modest as well as ambitious; you find your way to this album rather than it going out of its way to knock you out which isnt to say doesnt have some knockouts i put on my r ballot when it came out as a df 12-inch this past december but time just deepens and sharpens it part of the initial charge of the song was simply the idea of singing zinging-strings disco at last and subsequent listening convinces me that the thing itself is even better than the idea is an effortlessly stylish cross between brazilian samba smith n hacks to our disco friends and something darrell calker the composer for animator walter lantz in the 1940s might have cooked up for a fight scene in a woody woodpecker short its fuse a hammering piano line played on the keyboards far left features on the albums opener whose synth-and- frican-percussion combo followed closely by the percussion-and-chant-focused fallkenberg sound together like a far more polished take on something youd expect from compass point studio circa 1982 there is by definition something slightly hermetic about this kind of perfectionism yes is a to-the-letter lan parsons project ballad but do we need another one of those (the title stands for drunken angel a phrase too embarrassing to spell out but singing it is ok apparently ) but that track does point up the blue streak running through the album; its slightly melancholy even when the track urges you to celebrate as on maybe its the massed buzzes that eventually become unsettling as they swarm about at higher pitches; maybe its the affectless ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah refrain unpacking it takes a while letting it sink in helps
what background info there is on newly formed duo ctepeo 57 is deliberately vague silly or both pair are choosing to remain anonymous for now but have previously been involved in multiple projects y share an obsession with 1950s culture have a massive collection of marlon brando memorabilia and apparently insist that the cold war isnt over and claim that russian astronauts landed on mars in the late 90s such a fixation on context is often a cover for less-than-compelling musical ideas and although it would be unfair to level this too forcefully at their debut ep doesnt particularly set the world on fire is the pick of the bunch blending swirling vintage synths with deep-in-the-mix vocal samples and a hefty beat title track chugs amiably along its retro feel compounded by tape hiss old film samples and vaguely eerie ancient-sounding synths closer is a little different ts cut-up samples and lurching rhythm give it an instrumental hip-hop flavour suggesting that ctepeo 57 may have ideas in the locker beyond the by-the-numbers 50s kitsch that predominates this ep
the next release on comes from producer and he digs deep into the studio and comes up with two mixes here that range from broken beats to chunky house first up is the headstatic club inferno mix and from the word go the track gets into gear with some solid broken beats and rumbling baselines a somewhat seductive vocal enters the track and echoes amongst the chunky beats that soon get more sinister by the minute as dark synths attack the airwaves following this is the original vocal mix where the beats go back into a 4/4 formation yet the chunkiness is still very strong the vocal of course plays a vital role alongside solid beats that are surrounded by a pulsating baseline a melodic breakdown deep into the track adds an unexpected touch and also adds a melodic loop that takes the track out in a bit of style not a bad release at all here with the both mixes providing pretty solid moments throughout perhaps nothing groundbreaking but nevertheless good fun moments this release is sure to bring
electronic music is currently awash with producers keen to generate unpredictable imperfections in ir work one-take no-overdubs sessions using hardware (not computers) live dance music corroded output of a label like l i e s se are touchstones for a significant body of new producers they still use laptops but only to send ir emails shows belgian techno artist trying this approach recorded live at in july on an all-hardware setup album is built on tracks written in a way that would let van hoesen improvise freely the album which presumably underwent minimal editing and post-production certainly bristles with raw warehouse energy whe r by default or design its sound is one of murky distorted bass and mid-range punctuated by crisp drums and clean looping synth lines that emerge that gorgeous gloom in clap-driven intensity of (its sequenced patterns like sped-up film of multiplying bacteria) or shrill industrial brutality of you can easily imagine all this going down a storm at but would you want to listen to it at 4 pm on a wednesday from electro-tinged through to splintering autechre-isms of onto punchy rolling epiphany of its central riff like a demented ca dral organ van hoesen crunches through gears of contemporary techno with aplomb but lacks any respite because its a late night club performance re are none of those beatless moments of quiet beauty and introspection that have made years best techno records such as marcel fenglers fokus so great ultimately in cold light of day it all begins to sound unrelentingly grey and one-paced can van hoesen rock a club clearly did we need a permanent record of that maybe not
i suspect that mark the enigmatic kurtz figure behind the uruguay-based label is less cosmic sage than hed have us believe im not talking about his taste in music thats pretty much as out there as the truth but rather his ascent from geographically-challenged never-heard-of-you (or have we ) to hyped must-have merchant in just less than a year following an alleged telepathic tete-a-tete with beach-dwelling disco shaman harvey bassett not that persuading the revered beard to wake from his studio slumber wasnt a galactic coup but experience and marketing savvy are more likely explanations for a roll-call that also already includes matt edwards ashley beedle greg wilson and daniele baldelli latest ploy in this remarkable rise is a new sub-label that will issue a series of limited edition (500 copies worldwide) 180-gram vinyl-only records produced in the oceanic idyll of punta del este s studio base first offering is a predictably far-out affair grandiose and leisurely its kaleidoscopic guitar solos and cinematic score evoke dreams of the ancient mysticism hinted at in the title whether its mark or one of his celebrated cohorts behind the track remains uncertain what is clear however is that a whole lot of beach beard and bhang have gone into it
a couple years ago while sitting on a dance music writing panel was asked why ra had declared new york house music back a few years ago person asking came from deep houses bedrock traditionalist end and the idea of the music mutating via new hands and the interests of a non traditionalist audience wasnt on his mind this was the music he called home t never went anywhere the man said clearly aggrieved wonder what that guy would think of presents athon maybe hed find it too techno: a group of berlin identified artists who play aro with a so bite like m the creator m the creator of jack as on s selection here might seem like arrivistes and maybe hed like it do anyway f the mandate on all this back to 87 stuff floating aro is to try and transmit that kind of giddiness then a lot of the artists gathers here do just that just to be clear this isnt a back to 87 comp res some of that on here of course most obviously on s by can erstand why someone might not like that track: its a little too neat a summary of the moment t took a while to come aro but now kind of love it not least because it works better as a final flourish (its the last track) than as a mission statement thats a good way to hear athon as a whole not least because its best tracks arent content with sitting in the past thats usually a function of the low end s in has the type of vocal sample stutters the minds ear identifies with turn of the 90s house but the high gloss he puts on his elements not to mention a fathom deep kick drum updates things sharply translucent organ at the heart of s the as well as the fizzy vocal lifts shouts 89 but rides a bass with more dimensionality than 89 allowed for most thoroughly up to date offering here is probably t which unfurls an early 80s r b vocal hook (big surprise there: its from the dazz bands 1982 let t whip ) over a tight strut heavily informed by that era but oubtedly living in this one t jacks eniably does that make it back maybe maybe not but sometimes its enough for it to feel like the present
every year around academy awards time some smart person pipes up with the same point people have been making approximately forever about the unfairness of contests to truly decide who is the years best actor or actress goes the argument have the nominees all play the same role thats basically whats going on with ts billed as a celebration not a contest commemorating the labels silver release with a couple of dj mixes from label founders and but a duel it is nevertheless: each mans set consists of more or less the same 16 tracks re are a couple of tweaks chooses s original while picks his own remix while sticks with s original subatomic particles as nabs the p p version mostly though the mixes fascination is in their very different approaches to the same material and make no mistake: the differences between the sets are big and manifest ts telling that kicks off with the track finishes with soft breathing slow mo the sound take your pick of someone waking up and/or going to sleep that gets at the mixes respective aims as well: takes his time revving into a comfortable middle gear that feels more like backdrop than spotlight does the opposite he makes you take notice from the starting gun his own industrial ambient (second up on s mix where it serves notice that things are going to take a while to get moving) while his sets second quarter makes an early quirky atmospheric detour (via the ricardo mix of s with its distant lonesome horn flickering beneath a quiet sturdy pulse) the patient metronomic bass and jazz informed piano of s of lifts things back to party mode albeit from a slightly crooked angle ts not surprising that has the advantage: many of these tracks are his and indeed began as an outlet for his production work ts a virtue of both sets that they showcase the same material to such different ends but like most duels this one isnt exactly a contest
few albums have been as misleadingly titled as s lucifer from american husband and wife duo the music crafted by aaron coyes and indra dunis was soft focus dub indie and electronica more gossamer fairy than angel of darkness equally at times it sounded lightweight and insubstantial as did 2011s predecessor 936 which inhaled similar influences broadcasts indie experimentalism amon duuls krautrock king tubbys dub 60s psychedelia of the silver apples and like 936 which was re-released with a package of reworks lucifer has now been given the remix treatment the 936 release called on the likes of adrian sherwood and dam-funk but here take a classic dub approach by remixing lucifer themselves losing the sense of surprise but gaining a feeling of coherency the first track cosmic shows that have gone a more reverent deconstruction of the originals than an outright dub demolition cosmic tides was already the dubiest track on lucifer ; turning the bass up and smothering indras vocal in reverb simply makes it sound more like scientist than be e but much of seems like a mirror image of the original album: it looks familiar but also reversed where be e the bass was buried in the mix here it rises above the tropic lia influences on the version of love and actually provides the melody on the s 4 u version of dream beat as the vocals are set loose from their moorings so the music slowly drifts into darker waters had an eastern psychedelic feel on lucifer but with the guitars more distorted and the skank more menacing on it moves closer to the atmosphere if not strictly the sound of gaslamp killers more infernal interpretation of similar influences it still smells more of skunk than sulphur but does have a certain sense of satanic majesty more fitting its name
from minimal deepness to ketamine disco has never shied away from poking fun at trends within dance music but with his latest release for moon harbour the veteran producer finds himself with a tune that fits squarely inside the sound of the moment thats no bad thing when youre talking about something like its a track that wears its c cille and arearemote colors loudly and proudly no doubt licensed by a smitten matthias tanzmann who spent the summer hammering tracks like it at the few parties that circo loco was able to pull off rhythmically its c cille-esque tribal minimal a solid deep groove that doesnt fuss too much but remains addictive nonetheless while a vocal remains hidden beneath the surface achingly out of reach for 12 long minutes (when pondering how it works so well mumbling yeah comes immediately to mind ) meanwhile is a hopped-up version of the material that agn s has proffered of late that familiar organ melody and vocal sample pop up mixed expertly with a double-time drum who this track is for though is almost impossible to figure out: deep house junkies who like it a bit fast minimalists who are afraid to go too slow maybe im just taking the wrong drugs but this one doesnt make a lot of sense
when it comes to mix compilations few djs have had more experience and success than his mid-nineties and global underground efforts are regarded as benchmarks within progressive circles and they still sound fresh after all these years digweed puts more thought into his mixes than most selecting productions that will stand the test of time as opposed to the latest fly-by-night club anthems on digweed again achieves this timelessness: from careful track selection to delicate mixing his mixes are journeys that listeners can return to again and again edgier and more uplifting than his last two compilations fabric 20 and mmii sees sparkling uplifting melodies shining forth between late night electrohouse numbers a quick glance at the liner notes reveals that digweed fancies his bratwurst as much as his bloody pudding these days with a heavy turnout of german artists and labels but this is digweeds not richie hawtins (note to hawtin fans: is the name of digweeds long-running weekly radio show) and digweeds taste in germans leans more towards electrohouse and tech house than minimal there are no fewer than four cuts from labels great stuff and kling klong out of munich while artists on kompakt italic and bpitch control also make appearances oliver lieb a staple in digweed box since liebs trance days as l s g also gets a spin the mix kicks off with two slabs of tough electro-infused tech house: cruising by partial arts (ewan pearson and al usher) and feelin by every (oliver lieb) the latter all r2d2 chatterings and buzzing bass digweed avoids his trademark deep dark proggy caverns and instead builds his first half with a sense of urgency he briefly romances the listener with the summery playful melodies of on the run by popnoname (prolific on kompakts pop ambient comps) before the chunky extrawelt rerub of torch hints at more familiar digweed fare: heads down and deep the first half ends on an uplifting high: the stuttering broken lightsabers of tigerskins neontrance suddenly spark and plastic rubberband bounces across the dancefloor - this is one of digweeds most adventurous introductions the moroder electro riff on david ks beautiful dead lifts the intensity as the mix strides towards peaktime dringers flake escape and the majestically trancey roots 4 acid by rocco (rodamaal) are more progressive territory electrohouse duo trick kubic go heavy on the horn and pull up traffic grand theft auto style on easy before digweed gives us a sneak preview of guy gerbers eagerly-awaited follow up to stoppage time on bedrock knights of columbus is heavenly then its back to the electrohouse of digweeds forthcoming 12 warung beach remixed here by lutzenkirchen like fellow dutchmen secret cinema and joris voorn michel de hey makes trance-infused bigroom techno and jetchi adds a superb euphoric edge unlike its namesake mcenroe by dana bergquist doesnt angrily spit any dummies: its placed on to bring up the lights revealing happy sweaty faces basking in bouncy upbeatness the mix finishes on the hard-hitting and industrial: gebrunn gebrunn is a production which sasha and holden have made into an opener but here it closes proceedings superbly from the first beat to the last fadeout is a compilation with everything in its place although the palette may be techy industrial and shot through with a sizable slab of electrohouse the flow and mixing still has that unmistakable digweed feel it might not be fully appreciated by fans at first but after numerous listens it all holds true revealing new sounds and drawing you back in as all memorable mixes should have repeatedly tried to recreate the magic of their mid-nineties sasha and compilations - theyve had some flashes in the pan courtesy of hernan cattaneo and dave seaman but you cant help feeling those early benchmarks were never quite reached perhaps its too early to tell but in bringing back may have struck gold again
the ever impressive return to the scene with another release from the duo of matt slater christian lewis known as this latest outing the sum of your fears features carmen on vocals and comes equipped with two contrasting reworks the first is the original mix which builds with some nice upbeat and quirky drum patterns calming effects soon enter the track giving it a nice flow while the subtle vocals from carmen soon make their appearance accompanied by a nice delicate melody in the background the track continues to flow nicely only interrupted by a nice soothing breakdown midway that features a somewhat distorted guitar riff as well as some smooth atmospheric elements a very nice production yet again by the boys on the flip is the tech edit the drums are reworked nicely sounding a little more raw and quirky but the track really kicks into life when the deep smooth baseline works a solid groove under the beats for the first half of the track the second half takes a nice surprising turn as some sharp piano stabs give the track a nice uplifting edge another solid production consistently good are the intrinsic crew at the moment with releases that continue to impress two nice contrasting productions in this release and another hit rather then miss

you have to have time to feel sorry for yourself if youre going to be a good abstract expressionist says a voice at the beginning of in the first track on s debut ep fact that its robert rauschenberg is kind of funny given the context because bells classy restrained take on retro-sounding house is the polar opposite of abstract expressionisms macho paint-spewing excess but rauschenbergs conclusion and i think i always considered that a waste gibes well with the records hangup-free attitude all five cuts are clearly aimed at making the most of whatever youve got to work with whether its a darkened basement at 3 am or a poolside patio 12 hours later record ranges from a skulking 110 beats per minute to a rolling 125 but its driven throughout by stubby basslines and slightly muted drum machines with watery analog synths adding faint color consistency of the palette lends a certain sameyness to the tracks but they sneak up on you in different ways: windswept counterpoints of have an absent-minded air while with its strong chords and baritone spoken word feels as grounded as it gets whoever is some blogs are claiming that its the duo of rub n tugs eric duncan and lovefingers andrew hogge but he emailed me in the first person so who knows he keeps it cool
joy orbisons hyph mngo seemed to set off a collective hunger for bright garage-inflected bass music; if the heady days of 2006 were all about dub and dread is all about neon riffs ecstatic percussion and clipped vocal samples is another much-hyped producer in this lineage an associate of joy orbison and is finally releasing his debut single for hotflush but instead of blowing the roof off fitzgerald is content to simply cop his colleagues styles without adding anything new titles dont come much more self-explanatory than : its not that the music is necessarily below par but its hard to find anything that sets it apart from legions of similar tracks t the least lets us down gently the way it slowly rouses to life on pulsing keys skittering drums and vocal gasps is nothing if not pleasant but when it finally hits its stride it sounds like a muted hyph mngo same progression same feeling same everything its vaguely mystical fluttering breakdown is intriguing but the track locks back into its sleepy main section too soon for it to make a proper impact on the flipside doesnt fare much better working in a similar pattern: building up from hushed tones into a complacent groove it meanders and relies on superficially pretty sounds to make its unremarkable amble more interesting res no denying that is a competent producer but his debut release doesnt go much further than that solid tools presented with little flair in a musical world where these sort of tracks seem to exist in an unfathomable multitude thats simply not enough
modern dub techno has become technos adult contemporary taking a pleasant and once experimental sound into the doldrums of repetitive formula brendon moeller has long fought against this homogenization (armed with more aliases than a fugitive on the lam) and usually sets aside his moniker for his most conventionally techno material his recently launched imprint has had no shortage of releases ranging from the powerful tech house of giant to the plundering dub techno of or the flowing ribbons of just a ride this flurry of activity culminates in a second artist album under the alias unlike 2005s explorations vol 1 a breezy journey through the kind of deep but danceable sounds you could expect from when you start youll hear some synths drone and gurgle to life and then wait for the beat to come in and then keep waiting and wait a little longer after that for the most part its a beatless pseudo-ambient record moeller has removed most of the conventional percussive elements leaving behind a record that often feels naked and vulnerable it erases the dub techno dilemma by plunging the familiar whooshing and sweeping elements into cliffhanging uncertainty so even though the album contains edits of previously-released tracks like and is like no other material youve ever heard while a soundscape record from a techno producer could easily be a snoozeworthy misstep the album recorded in one go carries the same burning energy youd expect from a live performance to say that an album runs together seamlessly is beyond clich at this point but does just that building while you listen sprouting new layers before dismantling itself and idly batting around the leftover pieces its equally unafraid of getting lost in fits of deep hypnotic repetition ( ) or challenging bouts of drone (the tracks that bookend the album) as it is in being perfectly accessible on tracks like the filter dub of which retains the originals distinctive skank what keeps from falling victim to polite dub syndrome (something not too common to moeller anyway) is its restlessness theres a distinct progression from the sputtering coughs that congeal into into the synth colossus that develops in closer celebration an arc of construction and destruction that renders it both a captivating album-length statement and sublime background-listening ambience perhaps most impressive of all is how moeller relocates the true essence of techno finding energy in billowing textures rather than a kick drum or hi-hat pattern it may be beatless but is a techno album avoiding the pitfalls of the classifications ambient and dub techno while sitting comfortably in both

for most of this year berlins dennis kuan aka has laid low as a producer which is a little disappointing given his pair of 09 stunners: love the nite away on rong/dfa whose fabulous tiedye yacht-rock remix ruled that summer and kosmischer ruckenwind on clone loft supreme series a 12-minute krautrock odyssey from late december those tracks are pretty unalike and so again is the first release on kaoss new label each side features a remix by a different artist and they ease the imprint in nicely together tvs aera call their version of the track the and in their hands acid means 1989 rather than 303 a bare rubber-bandy bassline and mildly reverberant 808 kick not to mention tense rhodes strings and 8-bit handclaps are the key ingredients but the middle makes it especially clear by bringing in some dawn-over-the-motorway synth swells they blend in with everything else in no time on the b dr dunks kaotic mix has its own kind of chemistry: its a steady-rolling percussion jam the focus on a stripped down live drum kit and rolling congas while a dubbed-to-fuck vocal line sways around the stereo field its space disco with little of the cliche that currently swamps the very idea of space disco and then it gradually turns epic itself a neat reversal it pulls off effortlessly
when david letellier aka released his first album stabil you could hardly have guessed he would later make something like with its keenly fashioned melodies and crackling percussion stabil made sense on but it was also surprisingly soothing for such a severe label since then letelliers moved closer to the german outfits greyscale palette albeit with enough melody left to mark out his own identity or his album from three years ago was a conceptual techno lp that questioned the mechanisms by which society develops is the next step in this evolution with four-to-the-floor techno tracks set among beatless synth-led passages this time the concept is more structural four arcs each comprising several tracks make up the album perhaps partly to honour the vinyl format judging by the way each arc occupies one side but letellier knows where the concepts influence should end he uses it merely as a framework and the arcs trajectories feel expressive rather than calculated march begins the first arc with sparse and murky kicks provides an interlude before the driving techno next sequence starts and ends with beatless passages and has the whirring stomp in the middle just as each arc has a trajectory so too does the album as a whole it starts with the anticipation the first arc goes through an evanescent second and climactic third finally concluding with the fourth arc which feels like the epilogue to a tragedy how letellier achieved this layered format has no doubt something to do with his iterative production process during which the tracks are repeatedly adjusted to realise an overall schema all this is complemented by letelliers cinematic sense grandeur synthesisers ten sound like theyve been taken out a vangelis soundtrack and played in a cathedral gritty rhythms meanwhile are deconstructed into sculptures static tracks themselves act as individual scenes ones that were led through with subtle motions and variations vague motifs recur throughout tying each part the album together letellier appears more comfortable working with the album format than with the single track it gives his statements room to expand and having moved through different styles in his career he brings a broad outlook to a genre thats ten treated narrow-mindedly with these things have helped him realise the full potential a techno album expansive yet engaging conceptual yet approachable its a remarkable achievement
music as physical and psychological relief isnt uncommon but its rarely as personal (or funky) as paul s in 2009 the preston-born producer was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis a neurological condition that affects the central nervous system and his latest ep was made during a particularly painful episode that left him housebound unable to do anything except turn to his computer genres such as say pop or blues offer more natural ways to express suffering but little about gives away the circumstances of its creation if only because s acid house and frocentric rhythms insist on being danced to clues to s state of mind may be in the frosty choral tones of (another name ms goes by) or in the squall of space invader synths that disrupt the meditative drift of regardless of how or why it was made is another excellent record

just how serious is its a question that hangs over like a pair ironic quotation marks la producers vocal-led second album is a quirky proposition: a suite horny late-night r b jams couched in language new age spirituality this search for enlightenment between sheets makes a refreshing change from r bs default dialogue macho arrogance and pornographic detail but frankly it is no less ridiculous musically may draw comparisons outr acts such as weeknd but lyrically it sounds more like gonzalez difference being gonzales is a prankster whereas david seems utterly sincere in his tantric manifes such hippy idealism may fly on but by time david tells us that we can only dream a dream thats dreamt from minds eye (on ) more cynical listeners will be yelling enough this loved-up bullshit thats a pity as sonically at least has plenty going for it s output can be harsh and fragmentary whereas this low end ory affiliates sound is mid-tempo fuzzy and enveloping whole album sounds like it was mastered from a chewed-up old c90 its post-chillwave music busy and glitchy but as relaxing as a soak in a warm bath woozy psychedelic hip-hop title track or s re are shades avalanches sample-mosaics and animal collectives rhythmic mania spaced-out is less convincing; its mimicking silky r b tropes comes f like a of conchords pastiche to a pleasingly perverse slice experimental hip-hop uses many same sounds but is far more irreverent likewise playfully far-out instrumental whose title is self-explana ry tracks like se present liberating transcendence kind that david tries articulate in his lyrics he should let his music speak for itself
showing off a new attitude towards making breakbeats is on this release coming off on a more tech-breaks tip and a little miami bass (i did say a little) thrown into the mix pulls off an interesting release side a in search of something different in a similar vein to efforts by us breaks dj icey this track has a nice west coast breaks intro complete with some vocal samples and a high pitched bassline in fact the bassline gets a lot of pitch put into it as it gets tossed up and down the pitch spectrum - quite simply its a melodic bass line however it does sound a little weird and it would be interesting to see a dancefloor reaction to this side b me leaning a little closer towards miami bass is this b-side with a very unusual bassline if you have ever used a cd turntable with a jog disc on top and experimented with the jet effect the bassline sounds similar to that an arpeggio synth line kicks in shortly afterwards and the aggressive feel of this track is lost to some tech elements sorry to say but this does get a little wanky and could have sounded better without the synth elements simplicity is always good
as one-half of noisy drone outfit fuck buttons benjamin john power makes music of mammoth scale that is martial in its zeal to assault the senses fuck buttons are all about the sheer thrill of displaying their own ability to pile up instruments and arrangements at 140km/h; is all about the twirling sensation of moving but not going anywhere ladies and gentleman we are floating in space alright and its really really beautiful makes the most sense in a car at night or any place that you can immerse yourself in its atmospheres in cocoon-like surroundings opener has an amniotic quality with its aquatic tones quietly washing over until it abruptly bursts into itself an intriguing exercise in frustration as fuck buttons exhilarating pounding is kept at bay while power privileges textures over structure: the song keeps you expecting something that never comes this tension is what makes so singular the rest of is built around the same kind of motifs is so shamelessly emotive that it wouldnt sound out of place during blade runner s replicant-on-replicant love scene while others could serve to soundtrack the preliminaries ( ) or the climax ( ) then there is the albums 13-minute tempestuous acme its a gorgeous piece of neo-classical electronica that channels henryk g reckis spirit via the sight belows artistry if you take m83s most elegiac moments circa dead cites red seas lost ghosts and remove anything remotely rhythmic (drums basslines guitar riffs even vocals) from them what youre left with is an amorphous er mass of suspended olympian synthesizers expand and intertwine those until they end up constituting some sort of aural shapes with abstract yet poignant edges and youll get an idea of what makes so special theres nothing blank or bland for that matter about it
s latest release comes from mcmillan tab and opening some new doors for who are predominantly a breaks label and one of the leading labels in the underground breaks scene side a original mix on a deep tech house tip almost leaning into progressive is the original version quite nice and an interesting direction for who are mainly known for the harder darker side of music side b remix atmospheric tribal breaks with a hint of electro flavour the remix of this track this mix does it for me compared to the 4/4 stylings of the original

whether making crisp microhouse for soundvariation or grooving on deep house for yore ndy vaz has long brought his own signature to established sounds be it a little techno heft beneath otherwise standard house or a soft touch to something more experimental so its disappointing not to find his usual smudges all over the surprisingly by-the-book dont his debut for over a wall-shaking kick and fluttering melody marks enters the soul mix with the sort of smooth authority that makes him a dead-ringer for robert owens on fingers inc s nother side unfortunately that becomes this records biggest liability: you may not have heard this precise groove before but if youve done your homework you may as well have vaz is again going through the motions on the house mix crafting the sort of stripped-down b-side youd find on any number of house 12-inches in 1992 chunkiness gets the best of him here though: employing an oddly emphasized beat vaz seems to be hiding the groove from the dance floor vaz and marks obviously know their merican progenitors as well as anyone but this time out theyve really only scratched the surface
s music has always explored interior worlds sure it evokes space but its an inner space solid things genres rhythms familiar sounds are shown at that level of zoom where they become sparse constellations of atoms with his last lp aka darren cunningham seemed to be suffocating on this interiority 2014s ghettoville we were told caught the artist slumped and reclined devoid of any soul acutely aware of the simulated prism that required breakout by ruthlessly downpitching his samples cunningham seemed to be scanning for signs of life in the microsphere mostly he found static and dead space doesnt break out of the simulated prism most of its tracks couldve been snuck onto one of cunningham s past albums but it sounds like the producer has found inspiration again album is named after a mundane space cunninghams studio and after the existential questions of ghettoville it feels unfussy and workmanlike which isnt to do it down: now that hes back to just getting on with it cunningham can once again produce mirage-like moments of beauty like nobody else feeling of easy competence is strongest in the first half where stabler techno tracks sit neatly end-to-end some are dark like the pensive but pumping fantasynth others perky like runner or lead track with its steamy midpoint breakdown pretty much all of them are vintage in their melodic intrigue textural richness and hypnotic repetition cool momentum is only disrupted by cyn an otherworldly electro track shot through with rammellzee samples albums second half follows this weirder lead tracks like falling rizlas are tranquil and near-ambient but theres often some kind of interference crackling across their burnished surfaces on dancing in the smoke unidentifiable samples are tortured and twisted with pitch-shift faure in chrome the product of a collaboration with the london contemporary orchestra pairs mournful strings with modem-like digital squeals with visa cunningham seems to be ending on a brighter note but he goes too far the tracks jaunty arps only compound the sense of unease if youre left wondering what it all means then youre in luck ghettoville s elliptical press release led everyone to assume cunningham was retiring so this time hes gone for information overload spirations on the album include: rammellzee the artist james hampton carl jungs shadow theory the death star and blade via a peckham barber juiciest of this pick n mix of themes might be chrome lp sleeve shows a gleaming metal hand pressed against a human one for cunningham the material is interesting both as a reflective surface to see the self in and as something that carves luminous voids out of any colour void and the self: those interior worlds teeming with life again

oth philpot and phil e have hit something of a purple patch recently with philpot releasing a few of s best eps (koze s cicely and reak sl s trombone spring to mind) while also providing the springboard for aumann to release his own material as if you haven t checked out the lackbox lp do so it s great phil e which lackbox was released on is the more techno oriented arm of philpot and here you have two really exceptional (and quite different) cuts on offer the concept appears to parallel that of liebe* etail with two strong sides (effectively a double side) by two different yet equally talented producers produced by with soupy sub woofing conspirator a decade or more ago has lost none of its impact the whole shebang is propelled along by some very metallic heavily filtered drum hits and a relentless buzzing insectoid bassline there ain t much to it but it s incredibly driving and atmospheric this is a track that seems to be yearning to stay out late candy flip then bug out in an anonymous field somewhere the contrast with s uccaneer is stark aumann s contribution begins with a dry skeleton of a groove that gives no forewarning of the direction it s heading in things seem to be building towards a slow dry hump against ghetto tech then suddenly a xylophonic melody chimes in radically altering the sense of the track and bringing everything to a closer s always aumann writes his tracks properly so both the intro and outro give the j an enormous amount of scope for moving in whatever direction once the tuned percussion has shown you its mallet and ding dong this is really excellent classy stuff what can i say two great subtle effective tracks by two of the best in the business top notch
its fitting that lewie days latest record comes via in keeping with the labels usual mo every arpeggio every shining horn and every chirping disco string on it drags you emphatically to the clouds it might just be the young ustralians most accomplished work yet is led by tinkling spoon-like percussion and the kind of rolling arpeggio often favoured by nick chacona the latter filters slowly downwards over the course of each phrase always getting renewed at the end with a flurry of glitzy string-work it takes a while for things to peak but its well worth the wait with a series of disco strings swooping melodramatically up and down the scale and partially obscuring the backdrop of downcast chords the s remix retains most of these original elements but adds a giant robotic bassline this in itself is a touch overpowering a frustrating blemish on an otherwise polished piece of work still having replaced the arpeggio with a more impelling hi-hat it should work well for djs looking for some more punch days other piece dont is very much in the vein of tiger woods n innocuous loop probably sampled spends a good two minutes filtering into place covering the simultaneous advance of a croaking bass sequence the final quarter is again where things get heated gentle soul crooning and guitar licks applying most of the temperature its really all about that bassline though which acts as a kind of logical counterpoint to the high-frequency noodling found on the -side
theres this incredible cover image from february 2008 issue of uk music mag the wire that has sasu ripatti seated delicately on a white cushion sipping tea in his ultra modern white-everything home studio space with a wall of vintage gear tastefully cabinet-mounted in background the headline of enclosed sherburne profile asks what makes todays techno different appealing that rt of sums it up for me right re: ripatti man of many monikers styles swa d in stylish austerity reserve sitting on his spotless bed having a black tea on his little break between composing tunes that are just damned different undeniably appealing im probably unable push off to a critical distance here the present lover is rea n i as a little grommet wanted to write about electronic music in first place i think lumimies off tulenkantaja is among finest recordings of anything ever there are many moments in ripattis catalog that startle that educate that prick up gooseflesh on my skin out of sheer tympanic gratitude nd i am happy to say ripattis return to his long-forgotten nom de gear does not disappoint opener is a bit like how a luomo track might und stripped of vox echo left to twitch mature like a grub in a chrysalis it starts with an undeniable two-note bassline married to a primum movens drum pulse he lets thing cook for about five minutes n out bursts a full-grown progressive house moth in its last minute theres a bit of a dry spell in next two tracks which are muscular if groove-less analog gear workouts in a rough richard d james vein but we find was just limbering up for a helicopter ride over a gray frozen coastline its how i imagine ripatti gfs isl hideaway on hailuoto hitting a smoky talk in a danger -esque groove early so reveals its sinister side about a third of way through dis lving into pitch-wobbling synths hitchcock string stabs only incidence of an identifiable human vocal on disc has a huffing little drum loop a rubbery bass figurine in background rt of seems like its ready to break into melody n falls back like nucleotides that never quite coalesce into dn ur-disco ritual seltzer-fizzing are idm workmanship tutorials like those pbs bits where y used to show little kids factory where everyday items like yellow crayons were made cue mr rogers asking can you imagine what this machine is for ripatti has an uncanny ear for flattening a snare to dry rattle of mouse bones in a matchbox to thicken a kick to lid thump of a 20-pound medicine ball on a cinderblock wall im talking about textures drum aromas patterns within patterns compression gating to make angels weep the good shit maybe only utechre shares his degree of molecular diligence nd alone still has audacity to paint pop music on top of such a sistine chapel of beats is this my favorite sasu ripatti record no i like him at his most elemental cavernous this is an experimental flatter- und cut (when everyones deep house zigging tech house zags ) but like 2009s vladislav delay lp tummaa continues to pay out new surprising dividends with each successive listen
recent releases on have gone from the guitar-driven post rock of charles-eric charrier to the immersive ambient poetry of machinefabrieks piiptsjilling collaboration and the modern folk-classical hybrids of l p and aaron martin but there is nothing like all of the aforementioned names sound pure and pastoral even the dark stuff when compared to s godless shadows and doom is a sort of mirror counterpart to recent debut in 8 movements ir respective covers would already seem to suggest this with the debuts obscure equine-like forms straddling the perimeter reflecting the musics slow strangulation and beginning in the middle and extending outwards like in 8 movements forms a whole with its climax cycling back onto the opening sequence way it gets there though is completely different here the focus is on the divide the space between tracks in 8 movements was by contrast more linear and ritualistic moving inexorably toward the void via a tunnel of ever accumulating darkness choral sequences the distant radio song the edgy voices and machine noises they all seem to penetrate and disturb the serene void rather than the other way around whats more there are passages here that are almost uplifting such as the richer runs riddled with vocals towards the end of the first side and the swooping almost oxygene -esque chords that open the way for the climax not that the anonymous producer behind the moniker is getting happy or anything taken alone would easily gain the same accolades as the debut but having arrived second its true power lies in its mirrored coupling with in 8 movements and their ability to shine different shades of darkness on each other
when i reviewed the bookbinders ep a mini compilation released last year on meandyou i described the music as giving little away but possessing a strange magnetism ive not yet found a better way to explain the odd charm the manchester label whose releases vary in style but all have the same mysterious x factor judging by the aramaic ep crew members known for appearances on smallville nous underground quality and others have that x factor in spades the best stuff happens on the a side bounces along at an unexpected 138 bpm and its crisp drums and arpeggio scrawls recall the sleek propulsion detroit techno but theres something ominous lurking underneath hinted at in the odd burst abyssal reverb and in the droning note kept low in the mix a deft arrangement keeps these two moods in precarious balance a trick repeated on the lower-tempo where clipped chords and a fulsome house groove are pitted against wafts ufo melody dominating the track is a looped voice much like that in kassem mosses immortal workshop 12 : indecipherable and tonally ambiguous have previously released on mosses label and in its obliqueness and clever use limited materials the whole ep has a mosse feel the resemblance is strongest on b side track whose low-slung groove and hypnotic arp make for the eps most straightforward track gets weirder again fidgety arps suggest anxious energy but the beat framing them is dead calm another those subtle contradictions you can never quite resolve
well isn t this quite a progressive heavyweight matchup 2 progressive legends john quivver graham and rowan breeder blades unite to deliver a pretty tough and exciting production in the result is two interpretations but does the high calibre of the two producers joining together deliver the goods the vocal mix on the a-side is very bloody solid let me tell you that much so far for the first half the track builds nicely and flows very smoothly with a solid drum pattern and a wobbly baseline that works its magic as the loop flows atmospheric elements as well muddled vocal snippets flow in and out of the track shortly before a second tier of baseline goodness makes its way into the production the track takes a well earned break midway that sees vocal snippets gain in intensity and a interlude of broken beats join with the vocals as well as the baseline which comes in and out in style the beats come back in quite subtly but with class as the track fades out nicely towards its conclusion with nice atmosphere and the vocal the topliner mix on the flip is yet again another solid outing the vocals are stripped slightly and the baseline is yet again is of floor rumbling prowess melodies are introduced into this mix as bubbly tones are put over the tight drum patterns slightly disappointing is the fact that this production maintains a pretty similar arrangement as the vocal mix but nevertheless the changes in the tracks are quite substantial a pretty solid release here for bozboz and a worthy follow up to the very massive space manoeuvres pt 3 release i suspect many would expect more from these two but hype aside the release is quite solid and well worth a look
roman fl gel is one of the most accomplished producers in dance music with a discography that spans decades styles and moods and an approach to composition and sound design you wouldnt confuse with anyone elses thats made for some consistently fresh and vital music and for long past the point when lesser producers would have mellowed out or hung up their midi cables completely so fl gels new double-ep for comes as a surprise its the rare example of fl gel sounding well off his game is still packed with expertly crafted sounds and an aesthetic sensibility no one else is likely to deliver s all just a little lifeless opener adorned in pitched percussion and twinkling piano notes exemplifies the problem track sounds amazing but in the ample space of the airy mixdown you can feel the compositions chilliness others feature kernels of good ideas that never sprout into full-fledged tunes is anchored by a finely crafted and wonderfully weird pad roughed up by scratchy noise but its hitched to a loping bassline that leads nowhere a low-impact drum workout feels like one long introduction punctuated by a breakdown of sorts the bassline drops out for a minute the drums continue apace and then the bassline returns meek and unchanged you might say that fl gel is engaging in a bit of minimalism but that would imply the paucity of elements have an outsized impact on the whole in the absence of an appealing form to hang onto think fl gels excellent sliced africa ep from earlier this year which employed similar bits to excellent effect these sounds are just lost final two tracks go some way toward redeeming with an idm-reminiscent countermelody playing against fl gels signature zappy bell actually sounds complete is hording an entire eps worth of production tricks heaving with melodically incongruous squiggles a propulsive low-end and unstoppable cymbal hits it feels bold even a little dangerous coming on the back of an otherwise bum release its a relief to hear fl gels still got it
has seen german dj/producer move in a different musical direction and is no exception best known for hooky electro influenced house and breaks with a rock n roll sensibility his recent work is more techno/electro i m really digging the new sound and with remix support from meat and guy this release does no wrong like robot soul released earlier this year is an excursion into deep progressive electro-tech but with a darker heart the hook is a squelching ravey type stab that continuously moves and morphs over the top a gritty synth and punchy drums that glitch and pop in all the right places minimal in parts but not in sound the track has a moody filmic quality to it that would be right at home in the soundtrack to some bleak futuristic art-house film hopefully we ll be hearing more of this from mr m guy s mix is a deep dark tribal progressive number reminiscent of his recent release the pilgrim while deep and dark is nothing new for guy he s really nailed the sound in this one s always the synth work really shines and once again his arrangement really make this one special particularly in the second half of the track ll the sounds have gorgeous analogue warmth to them and the overall effect is at once heady soothing and infectiously groovy meat s remix is a deep and dark progressive/electro stomper primarily known as a breakbeat producer this track does nothing but pound fours to the floor s hook gets hammered by several sizzling synths while the trademark meat sub-bass pulses its way through a typical electro style progression this is your quintessential peak hour stormer fit to send a floor into over-drive dial m for more like this please
with following deep for the second kern mix the names of those chosen for s new series have been almost as underground as the music theyve selected needless to say helmut josef geier has been tapped for his pedigree rather than his pseudonym: hes been a pivotal figure in european techno for decades this is something sometimes forgotten by those who know him more from the electroclash scene his label international deejay gigolos helped launch or for his prancing around with artists like p diddy indeed the whole aesthetic of international deejay gigolos and its fetishisation of glamour seems entirely at odds with the voice that announces no desire to go in the vip area and drink fancy fucking champagne on s which appears here however its hell the old raver rather than hell the preening playboy who has taken control here kern vol 2 is a no frills house and techno mix with a hard industrial edge from the second the beats begin beneath the swirling pipes of s to the moment the whole thing abruptly stops after hells remix of capracapas 8 70 odd minutes later pretty much everything is beefed up with colossal kicks unlike his body language 9 mix from 20 0 kern vol 2 almost completely eschews any big anthems kenny larkins classic under his guise is probably the most famous tune here in favour of the most ruthlessly efficient tools in his box but whether theyre old numbers like s or fresh cuts like s hell deploys them with equal precision in some senses then kern vol 2 feels both classic and contemporary not just because it places new producers like alongside old hands like kevin saunderson but also because its industrial sound is now dominating techno again it shows hell returning to his roots but is also the return of an idea that can seem almost quaint in an era when so many mixes are mere fodder to fill up soundcloud: that of crafting something youll want to play again and again rather than simply download and discard an idea that in hells hands feels far from outdated
is a longtime purveyor of oddball left-of-centre house and a man seemingly with more identities than jason ourne co-founder of the wonderfully schizophrenic and now sadly defunct label classic solomon is responsible for wave after wave of house bombs (check we dig you cid for a shining example) not to mention a recent solo mix album of original productions oh and this comes on one of the most striking labels at present nice title of should clue you into the sound: music for the beach this is not hypnotic bleepy and rolling it s all about the linear groove of the cylindrical bassline part vintage derrick carter and part stripped down techno that holds attention throughout track also drafts in the vocals of veteran reggae selector earl gateshead whose vacant spoken word ramblings about the horrors and conscience add to the brooding feel of the track an effect quite similar to jackson del ray s contribution to shackleton s next to nothing final touches are snippets of live cello and a warm humming sub bass which make this perfect 4 a m gear to get lost in equally pleasing to those with a techno or house slant ndomat pops up on the flip with a decidedly more germanic approach gain it s brimming with bass but is a far more techno cut with a dense thumping kick drum pinning it together percussive clicks and hops add some variety but overall it s all about the relentless groove it might lack the personality of but it s a solid dj tool music for freaks you bet this one comes highly recommended
is currently riding high due to some recent stellar productions that have gained respect from the industry heavies very quickly just recently phil made his first appearance on for their 100th release special which contained 4 hot remixes of some classic tunes ( click here for review ) the irishman has over a dozen solo productions under his belt with even more remixes to boot phil s has appeared on deep dish s global underground toronto the original mix starts off quite techy with tight percussion and low stabbing and looping sounds while the mix slowerly climbs then drops into a breakdown with a devastating bassline the bassline is now the main feature of the track as new elements are added into the mix including short stabbing synths which granulise over and over another breakdown comes in and this is wear the bassline exits and the mellow synths return for a solo run as it progresses the bassline makes it way back in slowly alongside muffled hit hats as the mix rounds out with the short vocal expressing the title the remix is a hold onto your seats affair as it accelerates out of the gates with a slamming bass drum and tough percussion the distorted bassline comes into play and then we are met with its full force as the mix takes a vicious turn into an almost techno arena sharp scrapping samples flood the senses as the breakdown takes away all the elements one by one leaving the sharp loops to their own everything is turned on when the mix comes out of the breakdown leaving a hell of a mess if that s any indication if you were thinking that the mix with tough then the adam beyer lenk remix really hits home with mind numbing bass booming at all levels with the rolling hit hats and layered percussive elements this minimal techno-like mix is kept grinding along with sudden bursts of the melodic synths and even in the breakdown it feels the track is never slowing down while feeling this was minimal the mix takes a sudden turn as it introduced the earth shaking bassline that i don t think i can ever get tired of the short vocal comes and goes but the main attention is the moving force behind the bassline and percussion as it rounds out the mix a very solid driving production from phil plus the remixes will keep you on your toes and out of bed
like a lot other dance music producers from western canada makes dance music thats so old-fashioned you could easily mistake it for a dollar-bin record (it makes sense that peoples potential unlimited a label that blends obscure reissues with like-minded new music distributes his good timin imprint ) the new york-based albertan has established a sound somewhere between disco early house and the best 80s synth jams jex is a veritable one-man funk band with the verve and vintage equipment to prove it he lists all the instruments used to make and there are a lot the ep his first since debuting on running back last year showcases his gifts well features two absolute barnburners at least in terms the title track is layered with bongos and some his trademark sunset-coloured pads as well as a virtuosic digi-flute that puts kygo to shame its the perfect jam because it feels like its doing nothing and everything at once; slow but remarkably groovy it subtly kicks into high gear for the second half without so much as a wrinkle in its velour at the other end the record sits the other highlight thats taps into the international feel vein with noodling jazz guitar and synth lines taking the scenic route through each measure in between those are two rock-solid cuts rolls a fat one from d m-funks stash while is a jaunty house number with a snazzy spring in its step and classic addictive synth runs that effortlessly catch your ear jexs best music naturally sounds so unbothered that it would still be enjoyable on autopilot its when those extra little pieces fall into place like the cascading pads on that his languid jams turn from enjoyable to transcendent
part of being a successful techno lifer is sticking to your guns continuing to produce a style of music even when it seems like theres a lack of support take dub techno while theres obviously a market for it it doesnt currently have the stature it once did this hasnt deterred melbournes from continuing to explore the genre for labels like brendon moellers steadfast or haul music which he runs with two friends is his first record for a melbourne label that started in september in atmosphere at least sounds like cio dor or giorgio gigli only with the terrifying dial turned from ten to two still theres menace in its plodding beats and spectre-like chords and use more traditional dub sounds the formers ethereal swirls feel like mcwhinney finger-painting on a sonic canvas and his penchant for mild crescendoes adds drama preventing things from feeling too generically dubby the latter is interesting if just for the rich timbre of its lead the final few seconds seem to suggest acid but the rhythmic dongs sound more like a bell than a gurgling 303
s principal points of reference will be familiar to anyone following bass musics permutations of late: here we have usual neon synth leads bone-dry drum machines and grime-inspired clicks and gun cocks; res even requisite juke track a hushed tumble of toms and whispers but ra r than ano r flouro knockoff which you might expect from an artist with titles like vhs nite ep bears more in common with extreme left-fielders like dro carey or young echo collective his sound is crisper and cleaner than irs with a brisk determined step; its colored with a fizzy kind of clarity that suggests oneohtrix point never covering night slugs crew especially given his preference for luminous chords and hollow-sounding juno leads aside most of records seven original tracks slink along at sub-house tempo lurches through swinging skeletal electro; is narcotic broken-beat house in keeping with pal+s recent ep for one eyed jacks understated pairs a sing-songy melody with scattershot hand drumming and booming syn toms a heady example of primitivist futurism meanwhile asks what would happen if wiley ever recorded a track for one of kompakts schaffelfieber compilations s though that werent enough to wrap your head around two remixes take things in still more directions greeen remix is a slap-bass disco-funk jam that illuminates s links to french club scene while qoso takes deep into blawans blackened territory with an overdriven techno stomp drowned in reverb
a large part of experimental club musics appeal comes from its confrontational nature the most aggressive aspects of genres like grime ballroom and jersey club are distilled into pure attacks at their best the results are addictively powerful but they can also feel one-dimensional like adolescent angst creating a racket land somewhere in between a collaboration between lit internet lit daw and lit eyne the project has racked up a healthy online following in just over a year the music is often extreme but it also shrouds the violence in dark ambience apparently informed by black metal with get their first vinyl release a modest 7-inch that packs a punch the groups sound varies from bummed to bludgeoning always with brute force tracks are short and sharp but they arent single-minded: opener moves from its dime-a-dozen grime intro to a vertical drop thrusting and flailing as it plummets has a similar kink in the middle moving from electrical noises and jackhammer drums into a slow-motion second half that touches on dark ambient in other words can fit a lot into two and a half minutes best of all is where the trio hook up with frequent collaborator who lends the music a sleekness shapeshifts every few bars taking in floating hi-hats dulcet chimes and twinkly synths borrowed from southern rap the way they use silence to emphasize every impact recalls records like jam citys classical curves and logoss cold mission arent reinventing the wheel but they set themselves apart in a world of crowded clanging club music by doing it that much louder
the original version of s indebted to daft punk insistently repeating its schmaltzy hook over a foundation of elastic basslines and spirited keys the la duo bring in three remixers to dismantle their tightly-strung disco and with at least one of them they outdo their original in the process parisian producer lifelike makes a gorgeous velveteen spread out of the track but waits too long to bring the vocal in forcing it to fight with the gaudy synth chorus for attention it tries hard to be anthemic but lacks the hooky appeal of the original losoul goes down a similar route but stretches into a shimmering eleven-minute odyssey its fellow la denizen jerome who capitalizes on the songs chewy pop centre crafting one of his trademark slow-motion disco jams its piano hits become lazy strokes of sun-dazed melody propped up by classic jerome jazzy drums the slowed-down vocal rides an emotional rollercoaster via sloping basslines alternately forlorn and perky
you can expect s to bring their game when they get the call to mix kicks k7s long running mix series is widely beloved 2013 resident dvisor named john talabots beautifully balearic edition the best mix of the year n of course there are those amazing contributions from james holden henrik schwarz scuba erlend ye the list of stunners goes on and on but is up to the challenge and his chapter of the ongoing kicks story easily meets the standards set by his predecessors has said the mix is a representation of his club sets in that its largely made up of tracks from his labels ( us and simple) his own productions and exclusives from his friends ( nd when your contacts list boasts the likes of xel and why the hell not ) throughout an overarching feel of grandeur merges with one of intimacy not an easy trick but one that s been perfecting throughout his career kicking off with the swooning beat free made by the team of kieren komen lomax and himself the mix begins with an aura of hazy serenity typified by produced by komen (again) and when that song drifts into the majestic deepness of s which in turn glides into the nebulous exoticism of s its sublime fter this swirling introductory passage the mix enters a new phase typified by s featuring alt soul singer l this one is graceful elegantly rendered and fully resonant track weds its shivering sigh of a vocal close miked and sung in a whispering falsetto to a yearning melody despite its relative sparseness its dripping with emotion that feeling of restrained grace is one of s specialties and the tracks that follow s melancholy for instance or s bleepy detroit tinged carry that vibe forward things toughen up a bit towards the mixs finish s weds airy synths to a tough breakbeat a spare ecstatic vocal sample serving as the icing on the cake s ethereal sounds pretty much as the name implies s is a nicely skeletal jacker finally the set ends with the truly gorgeous by all skittering rhythms and cathedral chords res a kind of serene stillness to s kicks ; its patiently constructed progressing at an amble rather than a gallop but pay attention and youll find a dynamic set thats expertly constructed and brimming with soul stirring music its a dreamland testament to s selection skills one that deserves a close uninterrupted listen
until now the resista label has stuck exclusively to edits with daphni m croose and keyboard masher putting their respective spin on frobeat brazilian music and contemporary psychedelia labels fifth release changes course with ex-detroiter (isaac delongchamp) delivering two original tracks of off-kilter techno literally off-kilter in fact: both sides feature elements panned so far to the right that your first instinct may be to check that your cables are properly connected (ill save you the time: y are ) both tracks are so gritty they could make ctress sound positively hi-fi in comparison but the noise floor is up on stilts for a reason: veil of hiss is an integral part of both tracks atmospheres begins with a flare-up of wild spectral strings before slouching down a path of super-slow house beats; choral samples faraway synth stabs and a down-pitched rhythmic murmur tug in three directions at once in its disassociated way its as dizzying as a fun-fair carousel on cough syrup is marginally more direct with drum machine chattering at a 125 bpm clip; high-pitched drones spiral above arpeggiated bells with the latter half giving way to a polyrhythmic tumble of kalimbas and dubbed-out noise squalls
it says something for a track when played the same way twice it can stand to sound either dark and moody or sunny and spry ( what it says exactly is hard to discern but its impressive nonetheless ) s plays that way with techy grey outfitting affixed to what is at heart a warm and luscious house track listen one way and it sounds leaden and contemplative; play it again and it sounds fit for a beach remix of the same by m in makes it sound like a third thing altogether: a more airy and spacious and elastic-sounding house cut that spends a lot of time barely registering as at all rounding off this one is a new timewriter track that floats and bobs a bit more relaxedly with an emphasis on floating that ultimately makes it dissolve into something less than very memorable
it is pretty safe to say that has been a pretty consistant producer over the years you can really always expect good quality chugging house from tony and with this release on hypnotic nothing much has changed as he delivers two more solid house cuts first up on the a-side is shifter solid chunky tribal drums begin the proceedings as the track flows quite solidly for the first few minutes especially with the introduction of the very smooth baseline nice light crisp effects stutter in the foreground as the track rolls on and they help give the track a nice overall aura the track remains pretty solid throughout without any real dips and leaps the drums get noticeably crisper in sun dreamer on the flip again quite smooth the track makes good use of intricate sounds and drum loops that work well with the bouncing melody and the very subtle talking vocals in the background overall this is quite a nice release by with two very techy but solid house tracks on display

and his respected label have been around since the early 90s so its reasonable to expect a bit of nostalgia for the labels 100th release a remix package of his classic vion from 1993 the original included with the digital package is a slab of peaktime 909 techno which despite its early 90s production still sounds sharp and is chock-full of bright dizzying synth arpeggios you could also describe it as deliriously fruity with some kind of sweetness in its veins and the remixers here generally extrapolate certain aspects of the tracks character while keeping a lot of the raw roland-ness and upping the weight the most obvious thing about the collection being its imminent club functionality marcel takes a beat thats gravelly and body rocking and overlays a smooth spaced out pad that contrasts with the irresistibly heavy funk in the rhythms underneath relative newcomer 88uw separates the heady weirdness out instead with his remix charging more as it gets going and ending up as a pummelling chaotic monster canadian peter sliwinski who has collaborated with wild under the moniker niteworks does pretty much what youd expect a guy calling himself echoplex to do it has more of a tight calculated feel than the others with maybe a bit less momentum but more piledriving; vibrating lower range unusually wide variation of the kicks and some cool sudden edits make this the most interesting thing here if its ones and zeroes youve paid your hard-earned for youll also get john s remix which is pretty much a focused celebration of the classic roland toys with charging 909 drums and a nasty acid line not much else happens though so although itd be heavy on the dance floor a bit more variation maybe some modulation of the synth swipe at the beginning of each bar or more defined sections would have given it more legs for its length but as a digital tool for shorter use it does well jurek brought up on classical music and scrabble unearths a loop and does clever rhythmic inversions with it in a modest and more chilled out way lthough showing off a bit more would perhaps have been more arresting its yet another fresh approach
is the latest project from pacific lue k relay k delete_everything k shifted k well you get the idea the uk techno producer evidently enjoys compartmentalizing and his newest project is reserved for letting his darker impulses thrash free shifted loose of technos leash heavens suicide growls like an angry pit bull occasionally kicking up ear-piercing frequencies and shuddering with the soul of phex twins ventolin it feels actively hostile not quite noise music but certainly not techno nd while theres hardly a dearth of blackened electronic music at the moment shifted has the production chops to lift it above the average angst dominick fernows vatican who basically had this whole idea down already does a role reversal providing the ep with its dance floor moment re-molded wholesale into a broken-beat framework it lands with a violent knock rather than the originals buzzsaw grinding the uglier abrasions are varnished over with one of vatican s most perfect chord progressions yet
jay shepheard is a relative newcomer releasing his first record in 2007 on compost black label his style since then has swayed between deep house and disco but on his new label he merges the two genres in brilliant form with the help from tad wily the strongest track of the release takes the classic vocals of disco and mixes them with the raw drums and percussion of deep house the result is a powerful number; jovial synth stabs are juxtaposed with a menacing bassline while subtle bongo work keeps the track flowing and are the more disco-inclined cuts of the package including funk guitar riffs and familiar bass sequences takes the crown between them though with interesting arrangement and progression t e c_ is straight out of the 80s meanwhile even hinting at synth pop it wouldnt be out of place in the middle of an episode of miami vice fter two strong releases prior to this effort it will be interesting to see where shepheard goes next
eleventh release on berlin label du jour arrives from who ve had a couple of releases on lan muzik (who have opened a caf in berlin by the way) and one before on the 16th bass notes in prove that the tranciness of united elements with donato dozzy was no passing fancy but the signifiers of minimal techno are all over this brittle pots and pans percussion detuned male vocals it s only when the former fades out that the groove has a chance to really shine this is techno in the sense that it s music made out of the effects rack the melody is a pitchshift but in the end it s too minus for home listening and too stiff to please the dancefloor please wiggle more on the flip flight cancelled the tranciness is gone and it slows down and shakes nicely but what s berlin s fascination with gamelans that shit is painful here there s less emphasis on upper register clangs and when they do appear they fold into a pearl of a groove phew it might be too slow for some but there s a touch of konrad black louche to this one with a nice stretched note giving it warmth and build before it settles in at around hip level which is where it should be nice and sleazy overall im a fan of bass tranciness but the groove on the b wins the beauty contest just because its sexier one for the after hours or perhaps slap it on at home when you bring your special friend over to play
kyos is another name in the crowded world of electronic r b rather than sing his own lovelorn paeans however gerus twists the voices of others with a disregard for song structure that recalls james blakes earliest work but where blakes 12-inches were sticks of nightclub dynamite and had the feeling that anything could happen gerus music is conservative and mild-mannered on his most prominent release yet and first for george fitzgeralds he seems content to splash around in the shallow end s is an attractive way to begin the ep its a waifish song where all the personality comes from a softly noodling sax and some vintage funk synths but even these ideas register as chic reference points rather than anything actually conveying emotion the same goes for and which feels like half a tune all the elements are there but not really in place or the title track which is basically an unfinished disco edit the funkier and love benefits from a stronger backbone but its undone by some overzealous filter work only feels fully accomplished with a lilting beat gospel vocals and smooth composition its everything that youd hope gerus music would be next to it the rest of the ep sounds either undercooked or overdone

very little of sounds right in any traditional sense and nor does it mean to but every piece arranged by lisbon artist from the fiercely off-grid percussion to the noodling synths to the disembodied alien voices feels right the four tracks are so bizarre and delirious theyre almost intimidating and yet theyre exuberant in a way that could liberate dance floors nigga fox called his first ep o meu estilo (meaning my style ) but its on that he truly solidifies a sound of his own the records more straightforward cut is a mischievous bit of slow-bouncing tarraxinha with a synth line that catcalls anyone within earshot it doesnt jar your senses quite like or but it has that same sloppy way with drum programming like the producers copy of fruity loops had its quantize function removed percussion is the most dominant element here but its not always the most distinctive underneath s deluge of clattering hand drums is a seismic sub frequency that sways to the uncanny groove has a solid kick pattern to anchor its greased-up rhythms so nigga fox can let loose his basslines and froggy fx however he pleases no matter how out of control and unhinged each arrangement gets though theres always something to keep them from going completely off the rails comes to a head on the its a forceful kuduro track with macho shouts and a frenzied drum section mightve just been another fine example of powerful portuguese club music but nigga fox subverts genre and tradition in a singular fashion he constantly drops in fresh percussion and zippy synth phrases and flips from one bonkers pattern to another every bar or so as if hes showing off just how many new things can be done with this familiar style once loops its final beat you get the sense that nigga fox has only just begun to show us what can be done with his sound
drum bass stalwart and the leader of bristols reprazent crew has blessed us with his latest album the follow up to his solo album debut 2002s successful touching down after critically acclaimed 12 and album releases on labels like talking loud xl and full cycle records - as the title suggests - marks ronis recording return to - one of the labels that first saw potential in ronis production style what makes this album different to his earlier releases is that all the tracks on feature collaborations with some of dance musics finest artists including drumnbass mcs dynamite tali darrison alongside hip hoppers rodney p and fallacy beatboxer rahzel and house music vocalists vikter duplaix and beverly knight the first third of the album takes form of a continuous mix disc in the same way that roni had produced touching down kicking things off with a big synth and bass intro on bumpngrind featuring the vocals of sweatpea the tune itself incorporates trademark roni style drum patterns - tough rock-influenced beats with punchy snares more tough bass and synths to follow with vikter duplaix gracing the mic on pull up featuring snare drum rolls aplenty before the mix section closes off with the percussive cheeky monkey featuring two of ronis long time collaborators tali and dynamite mc time featuring darrison on the mic slows down the tempo to hip hop dropping a monotonic warbling bass line while darrsion spits out some quick speed raps more hip hop beats follows on with blaze on problems roni provides a drumnbass remix for rodney ps trouble - a cover of bob marleys no more trouble from his stunning debut album the future renamed for the album as no trouble the remix again features trademark beat drops dirty basslines and tough drum programming no more offers up soulful r b vocals courtesy of beverly knight accompanied by a funky guitar riff and a verse done by dynamite mc the single release is due out in early 2005 the lead single for the album out of breath featuring the beatbox stylings of rahzel who impressed us all with his earlier collaboration in tune with the sound from /reprazents in the mode album rahzel beatboxes in a drumnbass tempo cutting with vocal samples and scratches and provides a wicked beatbox breakdown in the middle finally long time drumnbass mc and freestylers collaborator navigator brings the album to a close with the ragga infused give me a reason as hes shown on the first two freestylers albums he drops ragga styled vocals mixing sung vocals with ragga chants on top of ronis trademark production style in a way its good to hear a drumnbass album full of vocals and on roni has shown exactly how well drumnbass and vocals work with each other - allowing room in some tunes to let the rhythm breathe while the vocals sit aside the shortcoming of the album is that it feels far too riffy and the beats really dont differentiate much between tunes - basically the same drum beat with different basslines riffs all the way through perhaps roni feels that if it aint broke dont fix it but it can sound monotonous at times and im finding that im skipping through tunes during each listen
as new instrumental grime matures its trailblazers give way to consolidators: producers who build on existing ideas synthesising and refining them into something fresh waless is just such a producer his debut ep draws on two overlapping micro-trends one of which taps the wellspring of video game nostalgia among 90s babies the other of which reimagines grime as weepy bedroom electronica gobstopper artists dark0 and founder mr mitch have excelled in both styles though s closest cousin might be an unaffiliated producer yamaneko right down to the fixation with japan yamanekos music however is modest to a fault; is a bold debut experimenting with complex structures and striking arrangements and are slick and widescreen their painterly melodies resting on a head-nodding hip-hop beat latter is particularly attractive with bittersweet chords giving off a tang of boards of canada rest of the ep is less firmly grounded and sweeter in mood sometimes these tracks feel a bit overworked lingering on fiddly transitions that obscure s gorgeous melodies but the wandering structures lead to some stunning moments builds to an unexpected spine-tingling climax two-thirds of the way through is a call-and-response between ethereal tones and clotted detuned chords juxtaposition of sweet and sour recalls another of electronic musics consolidators aphex twin

productions have been like hens teeth of late and he hasnt released anything on his own since its first release ruckus three years ago being one of the most in-demand house djs on the planet tends to have an effect on your output the four tracks on planet dont rewrite any rules but then theyre not meant to although to call them tools would be a disservice they do however exhibit many familiar jones traits: thick kicks grinding bass and menacing synth melodies the title cut reverberates to a juddering warehouse beat and machine-gun snares with s daniela caldellas managing to making counting to ten in portuguese sound filthy isnt too far removed from its predecessor rattling by to the accompaniment of whiplash percussion and snarling distorted synths in contrast takes something of a left turn its standout feature a bleeping analogue riff before the locked groove of swaggers in with a growling extended breakdown jones shows a sense of humour by adding commentary saying breakdown at that precise moment and mammoth claps
trapez ltd is as guilty as any sublabel in too often emulating its parent but once in a while they throw caution to the wind and give us something like in the spirit of the labels riskier more experimental offerings (what sublabels should all be about) proceeds like und or n ze on a chilean musique concr te trip fine company for precocious italian-born london-based duo their surprise hit viktor cassanova hinted at these vistas but that track was still largely obedient to structure; theres little of that here over 12 minutes a snatch of portuguese (presumably) chatter is stretched warped reverberated and left to ramble naked beside a clouded sixteenth-note bass thud the only thing marking this as rhythm music at the four-minute mark a kick drum enters then exits aided by muffled bursts of fizz crackle and makeshift percussion and when the voice is looped this could almost be groovy (but that hardly seems the point) tailor-made for villalobos taking andruic and japan on a more windswept and random wander is odd addictive and entirely welcome and follows a slightly more familiar path a winding cadenza bassline accompanying casio drums so polite they appear whispered gunshots spurs and yelled heys add hints of spice but this remains subtle and slippery like crowdpleasers rodeo remix its up to blind minded to straighten things with their afrogenic mix which ropes in all the elements of the original and pulls the reins until it resembles a tight regular trapez track this works a treat with standard builds and breaks accompanied by a palette drawn in own kooky rusty hues
as a member the postwar american avant-garde worked alongside the likes americas most revered early minimalists steve reich terry riley and morton subotnik she was an accordionist and an academic and as a result her unorthodox musical mixtures havent been reissued as steadily as her contemporaries but over the decades as audiences for electronic music have grown and the influence her contemporaries has been made more explicit interest in oliveros has become a bit a cultish hobby among pioneer hunters four electronic s: 1959 1969 a new collection by the belgian label presents some oliveros earliest works oliveros was one the original members the san francisco tape music center which in the early to mid-60s served as a loose meeting point for early american electronic experimentation the earliest piece 1959s manipulates the various speeds a basic tape recorder from a sears roebuck store and uses cardboard tubes for filters a bathtub for reverb and soup ladles and kitchen knives for effects is the most engaging piece here because its the crudest and most surprising oliveros was just 27 at the time and this was and still is extreme music closer to florian hecker or merzbow than the more refined compositions her more classically inclined mentors theres an overarching sense joy in discovering the harsh sounds she can pull out those bathtubs ladles and knives to make this mess frequencies the remaining three pieces 1965s and 1966s and piece all belong to larger series by this time oliveros was using oscillators and keyboards to manipulate tape and the results sound more like studious cycles than fresh explorations oliveros herself abandoned this approach to electronic music as she got older and returned to her childhood love the accordion as the central focus her music future work would be more spiritually inclined and meditative and because the accordion exponentially more distinct can be at times a label prescient extremes with this collection they present a portrait oliveros at her most rigorous and academic while four electronic s 1959-1969 adds to our understanding her development this collection is ultimately a master class for the musique concr te fan and not a gateway for anyone looking to find out what oliveros is all about long stretches are unlistenable to all but the most ardent ear for that you might be better served by two recent reissues from important records accordion oice or the wanderer four electronic s is a portrait an artist who (at least early on) pioneered through extreme impulse in other words dont start here

whether programming modular loops or writing a novel all creatives draw upon the work of others but where is the line between influence and copying seuil is a producer who seems more susceptible to trends than most in the late 00s he was all about clean percussive minimal on records like brune and double room his tracks then became hazier and more straightforward recalling the deep house of rising producers like joey anderson and fred p it was back to minimal after that this time with a renewed fascination with ricardo villalobos ( get up and 11 are among the most faithful villalobos recreations ever made) a lot of these tracks were sure shots on the dance floor but usually derivative of a popular sound seuil is about electro these days a shift seemingly inspired by a growing cast of mostly berlin-based producers extract live is seuils third solo record in this style it follows roots 82 a double ep so on-trend that seuil should have mailed a cheque to spacetravel upon its release extract live s blips blops and hyperactive basslines are in the same ballpark the tracks kick hard after all seuil has been making tunes for more than ten years but feel like copies of an established blueprint s bit-crushed snare and zapping synths sound straight off cabaret recordings or time passages while is a modern electro track built with a familiar collage of broken beats pads and bleeps the kind of tune that has become standard in the past two years only the chirpy chords and snaking drums of feel like they have a piece of seuil inside
klang recordings get set to finally put s massive hit rocker to bed with three final remixes of this electro anthem first up is wink s acid rocker interpretation and it features the trademark acid sounds of wink s work the track builds quite well using the twisted riffs from the original to slowly introduce the main riff which only sees a short stay in this quite twisted remix the plastiman remix is very quirky using slow baselines and twisted beats to get its rework across the pace is slow and the resemblance to the original is quite minimal the earl shilton remix is a full on grunge remix using some gritty guitar riffs and intense drumnwork a very interesting package with the wink remix probably being the simplest and most conventional of the lot it wouldn t be often you will hear that said

italian duo and dino are probably best known for the mind-bending techno they create together as modern heads a collaboration that briefly ceased when and the alias moved to erlin while meloni remained in rome to tend to his mastering studio as well as his new not from earth project on the second release on s new outis imprint the longtime friends offer no compromise to the uninitiated but the record should be warmly received by fans eager to hear some gritty new stuff from the duo of the two lengthy tracks on melonis is the more demanding one turn it up and youll hear how every third kick is accented and while other percussive elements play out in common time the emphasis is firmly on the polyrhythmic hypnosis created between those drums and a nervous rash of offbeat bleeps handles the remix on the flip and he opts for a heavily swung 4/4 rhythm that sounds just a bit smoother than the original still his effort holds more peak-time potential: among the jagged chords and creepy-crawly bits of sound that scale upward and downward slowly lets loose a series of climactic choruses the aim of both tracks is obvious to modulate your brain until its a pile of mush on the dance floor and these modern heads have clearly hit the right frequencies
russia s have come a long way very quickly and with good reason formed in nizhny novgorod in 2003 and with their first release only in 2005 brothers pavel and vitaliy have been getting a lot of good press for their intelligent and accessible dancefloor tracks that weave seamlessly from the fabric of different styles while calling upon a host of talented and diverse vocalists this single lives up to all the expectation like fellow russian contenders scsi-9 on kompakt have a penchant for complicated and often moody melodies but while the plaintive keyboard line on -side might think the same dark thoughts as scsi-9 the track is immediately more muscular underneath it all held together by a determined percussive gush in the end the rhythm is strong enough to physically shape the melodies to its will before the bass-end eventually awakens to rend more from the synths until the fluttering end on the flip is even better it has a slower swagger and a long confident stride as if walking home in the early hours with a smile on its face the warm spacey synth patterns shimmer off the sidewalk and bend the light like thin breathless water unfortunately there s no vocals on this release but that in no way is a dampener to an otherwise suave blend of ambiences and effortless momentum nd the good news is there s more to come later in the year
s music is easily placed on the experimental axis formed by and blackest ever black the berlin duos music proceeds with the same funereal elegance as raimes and like kerridge who collaborates with s eric goldstein as uf it swarms with plunging basslines born at a point where jungle dubstep and drone collide but are nonetheless a distinctive presence ( resurrection ) often sounds like a contemporary classical ensemble scraping and thwacking its way through a score are working in an industrial lineage but their music also recalls the ethereal beauty of cocteau twins or julee cruises work for david lynch band-member konstanze bathseba zipporas otherworldly vocals on or make that link explicit but its also clear in s general preference for soft power over outright brutality their seismic beats and sounds often come blanketed in foggy ambience and they repeatedly deploy enigmatic half-buried melodies to brilliant effect the result is a dense atmospheric album of real cinematic tension one that leaves you painting the scenery in your mind at times it sounds grand and mysterious at others it evokes a pagan funeral on a windswept cliff yes it is sombre yes it is noisy but is also rich and rewarding
re was a tinge of melancholia about much of s debut in april which mixed abstract funk with acidic soul and cure influences is a chirpier affair a summery carousel of jazz-flecked house and latin rhythms with a distinctly live feel title track has shades of early house carried along by shimmering nile edwards guitars x-fighter lasergun wooshes and aquatic bass it might be a little too linear for some tastes but theres no doubting s adroit arrangement skills here res more than a hint of steely dan on in its jazz funk-leaning muted guitar/wurlitzer piano combo while incorporates an extended spoken word sample about drumming into a driving neo-disco workout djebalis no-nonsense approach to the latter track which sees him jump on top of the original with rhodes organs and stomping percussion is reminiscent of early 00s west coast house and might be the most instantly palatable to 4/4 traditionalists
an eagerly awaited debut album this for - have built quite a reputation for themselves but if anyone was expecting to hear twelve tracks of west coast house prepare to think again sure ipp-e and alo know how to turn in a good western groove and tonight is a classy vocal example with a solid four to the floor backing the boys also funk out in the ambience of soul searchin before unwinding with the chilled house of nature and doo ya easy on the ears late night listening whilst they do house well theres a less successful freestyle intro which is a bit unnecessary a winning combination of house and dub in passage of time and the wonderfully lush down tempo scenario a smokers paradise recalling the orb in their heyday in fact the whole album is smoky evocative late night listening thats well put together and unwinds at an easy pace a promising start environments tracklisting : 01 environments 02 sol searchin 03 tonight 04 nature 05 doo ya 06 scenerio 07 feelin 08 broken arrow 09 new funk theory 10 so fine 11 passage of time 12 slayin the dragon

not long after its inception in 2005 s label became one of the most significant outposts for house music on the us west coast for most of the san francisco imprints lifetime a small roster of artists have been responsible for the bulk of its output with vonstroke leading the charge sound like its founders is tried-and-tested rarely deviating from the bass-heavy style that originally won over its fans on his third full-length which is also s 100th release vonstroke offers up ten cuts most of which fail to recapture the spark of his or his labels finer moments a solid intro kicks things off making use of thick low-end and a broken beat one of albums previously released cuts sets the tone for s remainder unfortunately its not a good one what starts out as a loopy percussive house track ends up a mess of crowd noises and melody ultimately destroying any sense of groove that its tidy drums had created this happens several times over the course of the next 45 minutes with tracks like and in particular falling victim to an overactive sample-trigger finger s standout moments arrive when theres less going on tempo loops on house albums dont come much nicer than whose understated digital funk gives way to another highlight cant eight-minute cut is vonstroke at his grooviest with long bass notes and a bouncy kick drum d be the perfect warm-up selection if it wasnt for a series of grandiose breakdowns which render it suitable for peak-time only while there may have been a time for the no-holds-barred approach that epitomises it seems that time has passed s only in its more subdued moments that comes close to the high standards the bay area native once set for oddball house
the mobilee folks certainly haven t disappointed with the design skills on their leena sublabel it s another great logo which hints at the parent with its circular theme but is sufficiently different to have its own identity nd more importantly with this their second release following on from the slightly disappointing holger zilske debut they look well on their way to establishing a similarly compelling sound for the label these two tracks from poland s catz n dogz also known as 3 channels are lithe athletic house cuts full of softness and warmth in the rhythm but built of springy and clean technoid sounds what tech-house ought to sound like in other words the -side to kolkun is the standout with a sparkly arpeggiated intro that reminds me of plastik in the way it builds into an irresistibly pelvic groove the whole track has a bright-eyed sense of wonder about it that is bound to capture the attention of dancers the other tune is more minimal and a little predictable with bouncy tech-house bass accompanied by sudden rushes of off-kilter noise there s a fantastically heavy breakdown but a disappointing and slightly cheesy neo-detroit synth lets it down when it kicks back in afterwards s an ep rmadillo isn t quite anthem material but will fit perfectly into many sets and if this is going to be leena s future aesthetic many people are likely to be checking out their records on sight

ive already said quite a bit about how german duo phace misanthrop and their imprint are doing a lot to bring credibility and experimentation back to tough-as-nails techstep fter bringing lix perez noisia and rockwell into their fold their labels tenth regular release is a victory lap of sorts first up is a collaboration between the duo sounds like halfstep with the bars somehow doubled up sharp staccato rhythm stabs are the order of the day slyly dodging drum basss stodginess midst the chaos of burning circuit boards and screeching basslines listen carefully and youll also hear the bleating of a saxophone a cheeky little addition the flipside sees phace out for a solo turn with mechanique a track that with its barked vocal phrases recalls rockwells recent constantcomplexrhythmicsound this time its big top-heavy synth chords that are at the centre of the track scattering rubble around in the form of pummeling percussion that the group can toy around with such gigantic over-the-top sounds without descending into self-parody is only a further testament to their alchemy turning the harsh into the pleasurable
heres catnip for a certain dance music type: highly regarded robert johnson resident gerd janson and dutch bastion rush hour teaming up for a compilation of ambient not ambient tracks from names likes roman fl gel motor city drum ensemble and tensnake the label has released a one sided sampler with arguably the biggest name of all me the berlin duo offer up a taste of what we might be able to expect from the vague description laying out a patient melody drenched composition that sounds a bit like one of the opening tracks from the innervisions helmed the grandfather paradox the highly ordered base allows for things to get weird on top its reminiscent of stefan goldmanns recent pitch bending experiments but with a poppier sheen (this is me after all ) if the rest of the compilation is this good we have a lot to look forward to
august seems to be the time for remixes from cologne along with traum s two dominik eulberg remix 12 s their sublabel has also released a remix 12 this time the tracks being remixed are from s 2004 debut album subject carrier john tejada who surely needs no introduction remixes 6:04 the somewhat austere first track on hacke s album tejada keeps the track mostly intact including the melody but adds a stronger bassline and a handclap rhythm creating more of a hip-swinging groove this loosens up hacke s head-nodding minimal track considerably although it still retains something of the reserved nature of the original perhaps tejada should not have cleaved so close to the original because in doing so his remix inherits the original s only flaw: a decided lack of hooks as a consequence the remix is a nice piece of restrained tech-house that never really grabs the listener probably best used in the early part of a dj set to slowly build mood spanish up and comer alex under soon to be releasing his own debut album on in late september remixes 7:03 whereas tejada chose to stay close to the original source material under decides to make the track fully his own it s a smart decision too because he comes up with a charming and engaging minimal groover that surpasses the original a hypnotic drone circles around as somewhat aquatic sounds bubble up from the below the surface soon joined by a charming chiming melody the track moves through peaks and troughs as under slowly adds more elements creating a satisfying feeling of progression it s a nice track and hints that alex under could be someone to keep an eye on
aleksei egorchenkov is a fantastic producer theres no doubting that russian artist has been responsible for some of the hardest-hitting cuts in drum bass since signing to critical in 2011 likes of stonehead were taut anthems that found their power in tension instead of brute force so how would that translate as an album criticals sole experiment with the format was sabres heavily conceptual a w ering journal which succeeded largely because it was designed as a full-length for better or worse forgoes that instead offers up a few h fuls of bangers s there ever too much of a good thing makes me wonder if there is gs start out swimmingly with the title track an archetypal tune: slicing drums hang above a flurry of low-end with a slight bit of h percussion at the end of each bar ts a little flourish that goes a long way nearly every track has that little something or other to set it apart the distorted drums on the tightly-squeezed vocal bleepy accents of dont or the organic-sounding drum taps on just applying variations on a theme isnt terribly ambitious however those intriguing little details get lost in the pulverizing blur one might expect that from a producer with a reputation for straight-up club tracks but it doesnt make it any easier to swallow closest egorchenkov comes to a shift in mood is the vocal track with an uncharacteristic drum break which blatantly jacks spectrasouls recent moves into poppier territory sounds as ferocious as ever on one of the albums most militant jams which comes early on before the fatigue sets in last stretch is a slog with an unnecessary version of which fails to improve on the instant-classic original ending on the same (one-)note began with via the twitchy steamroller again its a hell of a banger but with 11 preceding it your mileage ( patience) may vary digital version of the album comes with bonus tracks including a house tune featuring vocalist georgia ts almost jarring considering that digital exclusives are usually saved for blas b-sides or lazy leftovers not this one s sound translates surprisingly well to house with a naturally soulful but still bottom-heavy feel enhanced by equally tasteful performance t would have provided that much needed variety on the album its enough to make one fantasize about how capable egorchenkov is outside the drum bass box he occupies for the entirety of res not a weak track in sight but sometimes it takes more than that to make an exciting album

while in name might sound like some rank landfill-indie band the duos first official ep (also the first release for anonymous new dutch label ) is anything but instead s-gravendijkwal is a diverse four track sonic sketch pad which veers without warning from glistening syncopated hip-hop to grimy knackered house with scant regard for well anything: tempos change tracks start as if halfway through and end just as abruptly giving the whole release a roughshod stream of (un)conscious feel that keeps you coming back for more drags itself along on flattened kicks at a predatory 105 bpm crawl as soft pads and churning scraping percussion tumble in the mid ground with all the while a groaning male ooooooh adding an almost churchy atmosphere to the otherwise depraved soundscape is much crisper with glass tinkles trilling keys and stumbling hits all riding the crest of a much choppier wave before no more please sinks you deep back down in murkier waters clicking and ticking claps pull things forward while muted keys act like beams of light shooting through the sewage-y arrangement closer with a takes you straight to the beach with shimmering strings and keys and snatched motown samples that hang in the air above lovably eccentric first release
until two months ago when plus 8 25/1 quietly appeared on the shelves at hard wax s most recent club record was 2005s the tunnel / twin cities a lots changed since then in 2005 minimal was in its heyday and was leading the charge hed spent the previous decade producing reams of seminal techno records (plus the odd house classic) under a dozen odd pseudonyms culminating in a string of game changing mixes: decks efx 909 de9 r to the edit and de9 transitions but from 2005 on things were different maintained his manic creative energy but channeled it into things other than music: the cube the cntrls tour enter at space ibiza sake his dj sets once a paragon of the art form began to feel aimless and the idea of him as a producer became a distant memory in the bank vault of electronic music we all have our own little compartments recently told electronic beats mine had been pretty empty and im putting some new stuff in there throughout that interview describes as having a laid back off the cuff creative process he says most of the tracks were made without any plans for release for instance began as a sound test for a studio he was thinking of renting the decision to make music again had come suddenly while he was on vacation at the beginning of this year these tracks are the sound of him getting the hang of it again clearing out the cobwebs as he put it how worthwhile is that from a listeners perspective that mostly depends on the listener is one of precious few artists who can lay claim to a classic sound or several really from the spooky acid of to the ravier style of f u s e many listeners will be more than happy to have new material to dive into for djs a package of 15 club cuts from six of s alter egos is buy on sight material and to some extent delivers on those fronts the music is lean crisp and effective in a mix even at home tracks like and bring you to a place thats uniquely s cavernous crystalline at once sinister and inviting but something important is missing here these tracks lack the verve and energy that always made s records (and to some extent all great techno records) so thrilling its hard to say why the f u s e classic substance abuse feels genuinely threatening while one of the new ones sounds like its only acting tough or why s with all its rave hallmarks big cymbal crashes frantic half melodies backwards drum fills seems to be overexerting to psyche itself up at its best sounds like an homage to s golden era at its worst its a competent imitation of it this is more problematic for than it would be for other artists from the beginning the idea of fresh modern futuristic sounds has been central to what he represents is no exception in keeping with the original vision of plus 8 reads the press release we decided to celebrate the occasion by revisiting the very reason we started the label in the first place: releasing new forward thinking music revisiting an old sound on an old label in order to be forward thinking its hard to ignore the irony there theres no reason couldnt come back as a producer his utterly spectacular catalog proves hes got it in him and shows an earnest desire to get back in the groove (much more so than s lackluster ex ) but if he wants to step out of his own shadow hell have to develop a new contemporary sound one thats not only his but his right now reflecting an insatiable need to make music rather than just a commendable attempt at it (for a model of someone who manages all those things quite easily look no further than s old dj partner ricardo villalobos ) what happens next is up to the cobwebs have been cleared w its time to move forward
the vintage of s deep house almost suggests its been made years ago and left in some dusty old cupboard to mature marble and settle nothing here jolts instead every element carefully adds to the sepia 4/4 vision the result is a measured balance between soulful merican stylings and a more obviously machine-driven european vibe its the drums which stand out of judys snappy and keen slipshod yet functional they are the form and foundation of a track which otherwise simply allows its roving synth to stretch out pull in and repeat in dynamic but dreamy cycles is a more peppery groove with fluttering bongos riding up and down like merry-go-round horses at some blissed out fair during sundown while is a ready made catalyst for that point in the night when you need something to switch from lazy deep house into something more upright forceful and techno-inclined
mixing the epic nerdiness of 80s synth-pop a la thomas dolby with disco and a flair for the sort of musical complexity that comes from time spent at julliard pushes a sound that is simultaneously warm and eccentric if a little detached from nearly everything else happening in dance music while his most enduring contribution to music may well be his string arrangements for metro area we mustnt forget about his two deeply accomplished lps for environ the latter of which i need to hold on while the sky is falling appeared back in 2008 in a scene where edits and samples often carry the pre-digital torch its truly wonderful to come across utterly original and virtuosic compositions and im sure wed all love to hear from the man born michael kelley more (he doesnt write he doesnt call ) the title cut opens with just the sort of heart-tugging string work that keeps us coming back to polar before transitioning into the stripped-down digital pop the tracks vocalist junior boys jeremy greenspan has spent his career singing over strings play a bit less of a role on where polar trades vocals with finlands emilia lagk over an arrangement drawing from the producers spacier sonic proclivities i have a feeling polar tends to think bigger than singles so while these tracks are of high quality the format doesnt give him the opportunity to push his sound forward much rather than the next great iteration of we get meat-and-potatoes polar or perhaps granola bar polar something to stave off our hunger until his next more ambitious project surfaces
few labels fit the term modern techno better than svrecas semantica with over 100 consistently strong releases to date the label has honed an aesthetic thats rooted in techno but open to the worlds of idm electro and beyond set to celebrate their tenth anniversary with an absurd squadron of talent across ten compilation releases semantica gets right to business on 10 i is up first and offers some deep jungle maneuvers on its one of his more tool ish efforts with back and forth bass spiny drum loops and oscillating bleeps and growls all churned slowly in and out of sync with each other spacey and ominous s unspools moonlit arpeggios over a spare but slyly swung rhythm semantica played a key role in presenting the two b side artists to wider audiences whos released three stunning solo eps through the label conjures another mind bending merry go round in a crafty rhythm backed with crystalline synths twisting to reveal fretful sub melodies itll leave dance floors in a daze last is s fascinating ambient track her most ambitious non techno production it trips through tense distortion and eerie evocative melodies that are more carefully considered than anything shes done before 10 i is a great beginning to what should be a fantastic run of anniversary releases for semantica
with all the praise and fanfare that the recently rediscovered world of dub techno has been given of late its quite surprising that those reinventing the genre are among its youngest adherents youd think that the pioneers would still be at the forefront pushing themselves ut while theyve seemed content with simply spinning their wheels has appeared on the scene nd with six releases spanning a variety of labels a litany of remixes and even a highly impressive mix cd all under their belts in the duo might finally be the kick in the ass the dub scene needs shake it of its cloistered ineptitude bears less of a resemblance newer dub techno stars like deepchord or bvdub sitting somewhere between octagon and quadrant dub in the moritz von oswald timeline of techno the title track pulls no punches with its decidedly aggressive kick and bouncing bassline the choice atmospherics are of course all in place but the bubbling metallic chimes that pepper the entirety of the composition are what really allow it move further from the center never one disappoint minimal king robert delivers a more detroit version of the original on the flipside upping the pms inverting the bassline and adding a tasteful plucked synth over p again delivers an interesting take on the original reminding us why hes one of the techno communitys masters of the game
shanti celestes is a familial affair so its no surprise the project behind its second release came about in her former workplace wilfy d was working at the ristol record shop idle hands when he met ed eldridge a local promoter and they started soon afterwards where celestes ep for her label had a touch of rave homes in on polished classic house the euphoria of chicago house is a touchstone for but the lush sound of italian dream house and soichi teradas buoyancy also spring to mind the -side is a glossy peak-time jam destined for summer dance floors it features rousing tropes like piano chords airy female vocal coos and a nimble bassline is cut from the same glittering cloth and is centred on filtered chords and a hefty bassline it chugs where bounces oth tracks are cast in a familiar mould but rich details keep them fresh theres a reason why great house tunes often stick to a formula
talk about a hiatus: s has been dormant for going on eight years with only four releases to its name in its original phase its hard to see why pullen feels the need to restart it as opposed to simply starting a new label or somehow convincing another label to deign to release a 12-inch from a detroit giant whatever the case the aptly titled proves that resurrecting was worth the effort its clearly dance floor-tested and home listener-approved providing equal pleasure from its powerful kick as its lovingly crafted melody pullen doesnt do anything remarkably special here; its the type of track whose high quality evades analysis no words are necessary aside from solid tune the hi mix of the same is typically more freewheeling in its approach the bassline is looser a riff arrives halfway through to add a bit of spice the big difference in the two though is how funky the take sounds oth are approximately the same pms but hi shimmys while the original shimmers heres hoping its not another eight years before we get the next installment
this is the third yearly ep a series curated by optimos that raises money for african charities while showcasing african influenced music as with the second edition all proceeds from this release will go to the mtandika mission in tanzania who grew up in tanzania and whose parents run the mission contributes a clattering blend of looping chants and tribal drums that takes on a mesmeric quality around the halfway mark with the addition of a humming bassline golden teacher associates contribute a gradually building affair that starts out with echoing bongos as its main ingredient before morphing into a rush of bass and synth effects the wonderful voice of ghanaian vocalist anbuley dominates brian dsouzas dsouza who has contributed to every release so far adorns her evocative voice with simple percussion and bass and some unexpectedly ravey squeaks late in the track s closer may be the pick of an impressive bunch with intoxicating percussive clatters and chimes and booming analogue bass and pads leading into a stirring spoken word ending

leeds duo mak pasteman have decided to set up their own imprint and mint it with three typically low-slung house tracks those bored of the uks seemingly unending appetite for blending bumping 4/4 with bristol-inspired bass will find little to love here but fans of aus and hotflushs more mainstage-friendly moments will be well-served in fact attempts that deconstructed jungle thing: sliced breaks chattering over occasional kicks and walls of distorted bass its no hackney parrot sure but its a solid fist at revivalism that goes beyond the just stick some amens on it approach either side of its business as usual opener never quite hits its stride hamstrung by a pedestrian groove and a rote bassline thats only slightly lifted by the filtered chords that swing in at halfway more successful is stagger which positions its churning synth line amid muted piano stabs and a throbbing sub for something genuinely exhilarating not the most auspicious start to a label but theres enough glimmers of innovation to hint at solid things to come
what to do when your brand of hyper-spastic idm is approaching irrelevancy has been wrestling with this problem since the fantastic but overwhelming turning dragon in 2006 his answer a mid-90s-leaning downtempo record an odd and unexpected move but thats essentially what chris s sixth album tries to be its drastically nostalgic as if hes been bitten by the same hypnagogic bug that seems to be eating away at planet mu and hyperdub this record basically bleeds sepia resulting in the restless auteurs most consistent but least engaging album is drawn with a clear and confident hand even when its coming out all smudged and warped like first single problem is that its just not very interesting its nothing we havent heard before and its not doing anything new with the old ideas it reanimates when the album gets percussive as on or the vibrant trilogy it feels hopelessly dated chopping up drum breaks and live samples into tepid acid jazz just replace the svelte cocktails with something a little more hallucinogenic and youve got the idea as if to drive home the retro downtempo vibe of this stuff pulls in ex-tricky partner martina-topley bird for several vocal appearances her distinctly laconic drawl (perfectly suited to admittedly) is the albums tipping point into inanity where the tribute becomes imitation when hes not making trip-hop or acid jazz hes taking samples of live instruments like guitars that flicker and jump like a crackling fire on and dousing them with aural instagram filters result much like the trendy picture-sharing app is interesting for a few seconds until the gimmick wears off when listeners are left scratching their heads wondering what exactly is trying to accomplish here res no denying that is s most accessible and friendly work in ages but in simplifying his nervy ocd into something more digestible he smoothes his usually deformed irregularities into cookie-cutter shapes that slot far too nicely into predictable templates it feels like has been grasping at straws the past few years trying to find a comfortable new foothold by all accounts last record totems flare was a mess but at least it was trying and i guess he succeeded unfortunately comfort is boring
the 2nd release on sober comes from the laid back studio of kilowatts and the particularly soothing sounds of reflective deceptor feat sinestetici the original is first up and it is quite nice laid back electronic music quirky beat patterns and a pretty sinister but not too overpowering baseline are highlights but they never overshadow the very soothing vocals of this pretty nice track following this is the carbon community holy rollers mix a mix that turns the original into a pretty nice breakbeat interpretation nice mellowed crisp beats combine nicely with the smooth vocal snippets and chunky bopping baseline that comes in and out in what seems a random like sequence a very solid remix that stay true to the laid back original on the flip johan soh s messed with texas mix the highlight of the release for sure this mix has a good flow thanks to some nice gritty baselines and a very smooth and crisp drum pattern again good vocal patterns add some depth to this fine remix a remix that rounds off a pretty smooth release 3 pretty good tracks it must be said making this release a very worthwhile package
has a knack for moody vibes that has helped him become one of the scenes longtime fixtures with he meets chicagos which has become home to a dependable (and wide-ranging) line of releases over the past few years the result is less aggressive than much of kennedys other material but otherwise its business as usual these three originals (two on wax and one digital-only) see him extract maximum mileage out of subdued minor key sequences the title track apparently a recorded live jam leaves the kick drum mostly to itself while moving through dim spaces filled with steely shudders and distinctively plaintive synths develops a busier shuffling rhythm as an ethereal arrangement of bells cascades slowly into the mix not as dark as but foggier the digital-only resist strikes a balance between the two vinyl tracks with call-and-response loops and sustained tones lightly coated with distortion a remix of from nycs donor (who returns to the label after ends meet in late 2011) works in a tough unpredictable array of syncopated kicks and sharp metallic claps which neatly contrasts with kennedys understated fare and completes another rock-solid record on

the next release on australian based eq grey recordings comes from hywel dunn-davies under his alias of form function an alias amongst names such as h-bomb chimera and mainline his latest work comes with a delightful original mix as well as a reworking from kasey taylor chris meehan the original mix is first up the mix that has featured on james holden s balance mix a lovely mood is set early with smooth atmospheric soundscapes laid amongst smooth drums and a deep baseline as the track progresses the cute bouncy melody changes shape cleverly alongside the baseline and the warm pads it all connects to create a very smooth production that flows very nicely throughout kasey taylor chris meehan put forward their remix on the flip a remix that is quite deep again smooth baselines are present helping to maintain a solid groove in the track a groove that is helped with smooth almost tribal like drums although the track has a nice soothing aura the remix somewhat lacks the intricacies and intrigue of the original mix a pretty solid release here yet again for the eq crew and with forthcoming release coming from the mfa kosmas epsilon as well as the dirty fours things are looking good for the future
was the year that saw the munich based label leave its cooler than thou underground status behind to become a defining player in the house meets (n )disco crossbreed scene a move that was propelled by key releases such as jacques s remix of and the ubiquitous coma cat is also the banner under which the labels founders benjamin fr hlich and tom bioly work as djs is their latest official mix cd and its aims arent just hedonistic: as the bio states proceeds will go towards supporting children involved in armed conflicts support is provided to the non governmental organization play31 which organizes soccer matches for former child soldiers this is all very right indeed but if you own the imprints two selected label works compilations and if social causes are your thing then you might as well donate to play31 directly firstly lets state that there is nothing wrong with the stuff selected here pv start the compilation with the rather abstract nouvelle remix of s one of the labels oldest releases but its with the acidic twist given by brennan to dont the sleazy house/pop song from that things effectively get geared towards body movements tensnake mix of s with a distance is oddly exotic as if it were recorded in some sort of peruvian shack and it serves as another reminder of the remixers versatility and relevance s is even more intriguing as it telescopes piano house early warp like synthetic peregrinations a scatted chant and 303 motifs: one could say its the labels lost single as it as been criminally overlooked and criminally underplayed (the way it cedes its place to in the s ridium is just plain lazy though as elegant as the latters main acoustic guitar riff still appears) things then get very special towards the end: manuel s remix of zari s might not have the immediacy of the tensnake version but its less gimmicky and definitely more sonically inventive same goes for s s noize and s which both showcase more obtuse uncharted territories for the label s the very existence of this commercial product that poses a problem though n an age when you can find professionally recorded and engaging mixes for free on various websites ( fact little white earbuds yours truly) you must offer something truly unique if you want music buyers to pay for it ncidentally last october the djs released a free podcast for juno plus: it showed how cuts from their label (the mandatory black vans sumptuous moment of excellence ) blend faultlessly with their contemporaries and stand strong next to like minded producers such as nicolas jaar soul clap and tuff city kids or veterans such as marco passarani and lindstr m next to it seems pale and amorphous fr hlich and bioly have their heart in the right place: mean who cant admire djs who are thinking about the children right but on the strict basis of the stuff on offer here seems too narcissistic for its own good: playing with oneself has rarely sounded this unnecessary
one breakbeat duo that is certainly causing a stir with their releases is baobinga i d from humble beginnings with the feeling and buss diss on hardcore beats and more recently with rite of passage/get retro on fat records for the duos debut on they represent their garage roots with a couple of 2-steppy influenced monsters the aptly named stompin does just that the tune starts off with a latin-influenced synth solo with subtle percussive fills in the background then it drops into a deep bassline breakdown which builds up into a steady grooving break utilising heavy snares female vocal stabs and a growling bassline which morphs into a uk garage style triplet melody - similar to that used in stickys triplets tune from a few years ago continuing with the garage flavours is what i need on the flip in similar fashion to stompin the tune starts with another slowly building intro and features plenty of percussive breaks filter effects and a female vocal sample possibly to entice the ladies onto the dance floor a wobbling bassline takes a solo flight during the breakdown before a heavily syncopated latin groove takes control of the tune featuring a plethora of percussive sounds overall a very different style to what have released so far and its good to see the quality of releases kept high
luke chable luke chable how are you able to continue this mad streak only two years in the limelight and you ve has taken the underground by storm building a portfolio that is rivaling even the best in the business still in your mid-20 s you are prime to continue your streak of quality hits if you are not at your peak then i m scared (and excited) to see how far you can go returning to your old alias quest has always brought out your deeper and heavier sound with your prior remix for powerplant retains all the magic that was implemented for blame is an interesting title to the track (wonder what its significance is ) so my question is how many anthems can you keep creating the original mix is simply deep luke creates an anti-climatic anthem that still fills the room chable-style instead of big-room breaks or headphone progressive luke s mindstorm warps the audience into the world of cinematic technology combining heavy drums with a chunky bassline over lush melodies this beast turns out to be a beauty in disguise with the added key changes and chords building alongside a slightly techy percussion until the main melody is release the track sounds quite sexy once there you find bliss and heaven; nothing short of a journey through mind and soul all the elements of a masterpiece; this is by far the best single track i ve heard by luke ever the other-side sees the heavy dub dropping a more blurry melody and deep bassline over the dense beats while taking a more filthy and gritty path pushing along a very edgy side the drums take center stage key changes are more noticeable with the drums as the track dives darker than its predecessor everything is placed underneath and the sounds feel more upside down very cool you always wonder when a producer pumps out a certain amount of original material and remixes during a short period of time that he or she is stretching his or her ability over the production floor too thin that most of the sounds will be too familiar and most of the tracks will simply be reinterpretations of past successes i can safety say that luke chable is an anomaly combining his fast pace production skills and insane amount of creativity he is redefining the old equation of quality against quantity
will space build on 2010s hugely impressive introduction and enter the speculative ranks of greatness already expected of him surely a pressure-baiting album isnt far off but in the meantime the charge to remix seems as good a springboard as any for the defense of his space-funk crown he succeeds in doing just that; neither bettered nor built on nor worse to be sure but comfortable on the same astral plane as before the principal difference between this and previous efforts is tempo the prevailing sound aesthetic is his trademark percussion batted by the wings of an intergalactic hummingbird the graces and mordents of virtuoso funk chords that genuinely sound the same as his supernova-lit record sleeves look but with such a remix task the voice screaming techno must be hard to shake and so the starlight elongates to 130 pm it suits it sounds like a drexciyan neptune only less seafaring more planetary ut then it also sounds a bit like cosmo30 travel duration or mercurial ttraction with the pitch jammed high raising an ever-so-slight suspicion that at some point in the future there might be talk of a fancy fingerwork x lush pad / 4 sdc formula ullion flies in the face of definition with a madcap but not unwelcome turn lighting at an unknown station somewhere between prog and kraut the uk producer is at once space cadet and pied-piper punctuating sci-fi sounds with folk interludes over a beat that craves and receives a motorik makeover no ufos said juan tkins what about ufo radio ask sdc and ullion
s debut is s most pop-friendly record yet preceded by bits of synthy krautrock new beat-tinted electro and house music from brazil labels other stab at electronic pop emmanuelles snotty free hifi internet was its most endearing release but swaddled in reverb and techno chords strikes a mature tone with its glossy sheen and romantic anxieties both songs stem from the same idea but are approached from slightly different angles is more surefooted on her milky vocal present but faded at the edges sometimes ghost-like a cushioned 4/4 gives the track a billowing outline as its innards throb softly delicate vocal harmonies and teardrop idiophones drift over each other on but its unyielding pulse does these gentle fragments few favours both songs address a lover s words smeared in doubt and longing and the music feels clouded in the same way it gives an air of mystery on but shes almost invisible on concealed by soggy reverb that lingers like too much perfume
s richard sen made quite an impression last year with his 12 s signal failure and re you nywhere and although very likeable is no great departure from its predecessors dark-disco stylings with its tirelessly pumping rhythm chugging electronics and artfully brooding electric guitars echoing f to one side mix this would have fitted right in as one segment lcd soundsystem s epic 45 33 jogging-music piece for nike released late last year in fact breakdown in middle sounds just perfect for reviving spirits tired joggers before y sprint onwards is an altoge r seedier affair sounding like something fermented in bowels new york underground over a stomping rhythm snarling clash-like guitars prang and a saxophone swoops and squawks like a distressed bird; and a dirty aggressive bass rumbles menacingly the new wave-influenced feel (with elements punk and reggae tossed seamlessly into mix) is very seductive and while nei r tracks have immediate appeal a signal failure if this is an indication direction is headed i m more than willing to follow him re
wigflex associate s debut album circa was a lesson in how tech house and mnml could be made to fit into the bass music continuum emblazoning lean precise grooves with veins of shimmering fluorescence colourful squiggly and restless it was an album whose complexity could prove almost overwhelming presented in more digestible ep form on however s sound hits even harder the eps lead track is a mixed bag: on the surface its one of s prettiest things yet all smoke and mirrors saturated in a coat of reflective sheen but its earnest vocal from stomps over the majesty rather than accentuating it mancunian upstart and labelmate empyrean provides one of his broadly sweeping ambient garage pieces with his rework while torinos vaghe jacks up the volume and distorts the elements for a jarringly jagged remix the eps other two tracks could have fit quite easily on circa but they arent mere leftovers: theres distinct progression here s attention to detail now feels organic rather than painstaking check the little glints of realistic drum samples on that light up the otherwise spongy groove the result is something that finally feels as immersive as it sounds with especially swelling with brilliant photographic realism moving forward it seems as if is ready to open up that world of dazzling colour he let us glimpse from afar on his debut album and its just as rich and satisfying as we could have hoped for
e might expect by prins thomas and bj rn torske to contain particular ingredients principally the elaborate space disco pioneered by torske and refined by thomas and peers like lindstr m and todd terje the album has its share of eccentric kosmische-kissed tunes but the emphasis is on tone and groove over songcraft and ornamentation s tracks are sparsely arranged with a handful of instruments and bare melodies on most thats likely down to the way the album came together emerging from a studio jam session as torske put it recorded by pure fancy the resulting songs fall into two categories those illuminated however obliquely by a mirror balls refracted light and those with a more sinister glow s simple kick-and-snare pattern and purring low-end assisted by plucked bass guitar and roller-rink organs belong in the former camp with its lonesome keys and rat-a-tat rhythm conveys a windswept vista the loping conjures up warmer climes via an insistent cuica and in the distance swirling tuned percussion occasionally overshadowed by a thrumming spectral wail can be shadowy take with its rumbling kick haunted-house organ and sweat-on-the-congas percussion its a cousin to torskes fuglekongen the doomy dub of is a few shades darker than most anything that torske or thomas have produced to date despite the albums rich atmospheres the tracks seem more like sketches than fully realised tracks a little less effects-led ebb and flow (and a touch more structure) might have made more vibrant the albums absorbing collection of mood pieces though are rewarding and evocative enough to make it worth your while
the piano is an instrument that currently fascinates electronic producers n the past year artists as disparate as emika and guti have released solo piano albums meanwhile a growing number of pianists most notably hauschka and francesco tristano who has just released a body language mix on get physical are exploring the intersection of techno and modern classical composition s contribution to this field dates to 2010 t was originally written for an art installation piece she is not jumping on any bandwagon but like her peers gonzalez is clearly obsessed with both the tonal range of the piano and the way in which like much electronic music it encourages the player to toy with short looped phrases over long periods n nils frahms work that mechanical repetition is balanced with moments of quiet tender beauty whereas gonzalezs music is harsher more urgent less technically accomplished less emotionally raw there is a plangent quality to but despite its elegiac title really hits home in its revved-up declarative moments on v and particularly on the latter gonzalezs playing recalls the spiralling modular synth-scapes that she used to create with gavin russom completing that circle the new york producer bryce has remixed these four tracks in a playfully experimental way reminiscent of oneohtrix point never remix has a highly artificial metallic sheen but is no less poignant for that while across remix and remix toggles around a kick-drum with all the loose insouciance of wolfgang voigt a delirious languorous 13 minutes of rippling piano and surging acid-tinged synths remix is the kind of thing you could imagine villalobos dropping mid-set to conjure a moment of transcendent reverie
liechtensteins are a three-piece that seem to delight in dressing up for their live shows but theres nothing distracting you from the music on their debut 12-inch for mathematics: trios tunes are unencumbered easy listening house music for those more fit for the rocking chair than rocking the house may sound like the work of amateurs but its thin in all the best ways a low-rent take on boogie disco that is funky enough to make up for the fact that its low-end may not be the heaviest youve ever heard ( ecstatically simple piano that drops in halfway through helps charm-wise ) its perhaps me though that works best a track that invites you to take your lady back to the pad and put on the fireplace dvd on the television boomkat mentioned floating points in their write-up of the release and its a fair comparison even if this is simpler stuff than samual shepherds full-tilt compositions same goes for which is given two more minutes and accordingly fills its time vamping on the main theme with aplomb sounding like the complete opposite of what their elaborate stage costumes might suggest
until this year s endeavours have often been in collaboration with others like his label with milton bradley k209 and the grounded theory party and booking agency in berlin but the second ep on his new manhigh label continues an overdue conversation about baer as a solo artist the record shows his taste in strobing bangers like the waspish synthy mirage of to be immaculate as ever but the music falters when it turns to contemplative moods in foregrounding with repetitive elements including a two-note pulse and a ticking hi-hat baer wants us to notice the subtler motions underneath theres the whistling wind of an empty subway station but before long youll want the track to go somewhere kangding s remix of bends the originals metallic noise and metronomic rhythm into bolder angles is a stomping dj tool that twists a high-pass filter over a dripping tap splitting the difference between the kinetic energy of and the weary tread of it adds the customary variety of baers records in favouring the aggressive stride of s better tracks it also plays to his strengths

is modular synth music and if we included the liner notes that detail exactly how it was made it would about double the reviews word count the details of m geddes gengrass patch would help probably 2 of people understand his method with the clarity of a cookbook for the rest of us all we need know is that a system has been set in place to produce perpetual multilayered music this is by no means a new idea in but its one that can deeply satisfy close listening if youre say a fan of labyrinth techno exploring the kraut-inflected synth epics by the likes of john elliott or bee mask gengras describes the first piece 03 06 2015 as two pairs of marimba mallets attached to a pair of dice an image that gives you a sense of how the rapid-fire string of tones shift and tumble through a series of plaintive pitches however the action isnt really in the oscillators and their pinging rhythms but in their harmonic after-effects big billowing clouds of rich colour roar like sea spray and youll either find yourself luxuriating in their glow or waiting for more traditional forms of development like 03 06 2015 04 10 15 comfortably fills an entire side of the cassette and its somewhat angular textures mutate into plucked string tones over the course of 30-plus minutes sound transformation is a core compositional strategy here but when the medium becomes the message the music may feel inessential for listeners who value linear structure and contrasts functionally-minded types however could layer these pieces over drum bass tunes to brain-expanding effect

garic walker and head jeremy p caulfield are all artists who have relocated from their original bases (sweden merica and canada respectively) to berlin chases isnt dispensable but theres a nagging feeling that it wants to be like everybody else production-wise its solid its well-engineered from a technical point of view with balance of the sounds and plenty of needle ballistics this is shown most clearly in a rolling samba with punch and dynamism the musical ideas simple hooks complex rhythmic constructions feel comfortable and familiar but not too familiar nd these three tunes dont adhere particularly to the beaten track chases for example is a game of two halves the first is focused on a bassline thats more punctuation than riff but more than just a rhythmic element as well and the second half is trackier and deeper but with an unconvincing electric piano riffing lazily and a strap-on bassline underpinning generic balearic washing is decent background music but nothing more too doesnt deliver on its promise of devastation as much as youd like it to stretching the intro for a good 50 of the track before anything particularly interesting happens overall the split of originality and recycling over the whole package is about fifty-fifty as well with the -side taking the lions share of the good stuff
for such a well respected artist rene pawlowitz seems extraordinarily unfussy while other producers tool around in the studio for hours trying to find the right tones and timbres pawlowitz says he just gets an idea in his head sits down and executes it his swift approach is not lost on the final product; listening to you dont picture him second guessing himself very much belaboring the placement of a snare or the curve of an envelope each song though very intricate is clear concise and unembellished doing just what it needs to do and then ending intentional or not is a fitting title: the album never stays in one place for long with most records you reach a point a few tracks in where the artist has more or less revealed his hand making whats to come at least stylistically fairly clear pawlowitz doesnt let this happen in fact for the first part of the album its like hes deliberately faking out his audience: a heavy momentum gets going early with the records clubbiest song then abruptly drops off with a slow atmospheric piece with a syncopated beat that takes four minutes to kick in pawlowitz keeps up this non linear narrative for the rest of the album skipping through tempos moods and time signatures without much issue until eventually arriving at a 160 bpm drum bass indulgence at first pass the album might not sound as rich as ding the past pawlowitzs excellent debut album from 008 but really its just a bit less flashy that long player was packed with lush imagery and emotive chords but has more to offer in the way of subtle detail that said the record is by no means cold and emotionless: the title track provides a nice dose of soothing ambiance way breaks things up with its carefree slightly delirious mood and evokes the epic melancholy of aphex twins selected ambient works n theres wax forever ) the unabashed ode to berlins most well loved record shop whose euphoric arpeggios betray just how important the place really is to in the three years or so since his last album pawlowitz has garnered a lot of acclaim for his wax and eqd series through which he releases expertly crafted club tracks listening to it seems like he used these channels to get all the bangers out of his system leaving the more exploratory work to be done as aforementioned club tunes are great but pawlowitz is most innovative within the open framework of the long player where wax and eqd attempt to perfect an already established formula transcends the formulas altogether and more so on his new album than ever before hes gone on record saying he finds most techno today boring and too structurally rigid on he presents a very convincing alternative
whats wrong with s newest on not much whats right with it not too much either it just lies there a little bit quirky a little bit not quirky enough puttering along another 12-inch for the pile with s high standard of quality for such things youre apt to give it a few listens to make sure you arent missing something i was too but i can safely say that the smooth chug of the doesnt deepen with time it simply fades into the background pop it into a set and you wont get the screw face but it wont be screwing itself the other way either same goes for the whose analog fantasia twirls along merrily its nice nd well its nice you know the has the sort of quirk that sticks with you: it sounds like an edit of an 80s tune but the vocals are all wordless ahs and eeyaahs frustrating any immediate recognition its gone mark e and its the most interesting thing here
has been on fine form lately having carved out a distinctive space in bristols post-livity sound landscape with this turn for the hotline label he presents his style at if not its most striking then certainly its most refined these tracks may lack the bolder junglist clatter of renegades or resolve or indeed the panic-inducing intensity of amor fati but beneath their sleeker contours lies a rewarding character and playfulness is particularly pared back consisting of little more than a single shimmering arp and a cross-rhythmic groove of the livity school rolling muscular implacable these elements are arranged into a finely wrought linear structure if you were asked to imagine a bristol-school take on tunnel-vision techno it would be this hits the pleasure centres faster bringing to mind some of hotlines more boisterous material (this remember is the label responsible for kahn neeks incendiary backchat ) still keeps its soca-tinged groove and ping-pong bell-tones on a tight leash we know he can be wilder but here he shows he can be disciplined too
the release of the ep is the most concrete evidence yet of a growing interest in new grime from japans label formerly best known for releasing house- and techno-indebted productions by the likes of maulin and (in his eski-house days) slackk in the past year the label has released odds and ends from visionist and arctic but the signing of houstons is a particular coup has earned recognition in recent months for his bold highly abstract recastings of classic grime motifs the double dragon ep and satellite his contribution to keysounds this is how we roll compilation burrowed deep into the styles icy core returning with disjointed shards of the familiar is a slightly brighter proposition at least is something other than unremittingly bleak its sprightly snare syncopations and shredded vocal samples recalling helixs sparse beat tracks otherwise hats and gloves should be kept within arms reach the title tracks cut-glass synths wheel cautiously around wobbling globules of bass its an exploration as with visionists recent output of the point where grime dissolves into vapour the metabolism of meanwhile has been slowed to a crawl its tentative bongo work smashed-glass percussion and enormous sub line appearing on the verge of cryogenic stasis finally s frigid square waves wail in beatless space its grim yes but strangely beautiful a formula seems to have nailed
the tagline for s website tells us that they make electronic grooves for music lovers only hardly anything could be more inclusive of course ut once you put needle to plastic youll soon find that electronic grooves for music lovers means something along the lines of a jittery less immediate nathan fake rip or something very very similar to herzblut label head stephan odzins myriad 12-inch releases fair enough its frustrating though to think that there is a group of people who have seemingly grown up listening to james holden and co and slavishly devote themselves to crafting tracks that evoke the exact same vibe lack of creativity nah i don t think creating something new is the point here s skittering percussive elements and filtered melody sound like they were bought rather than arrived at through experimentation for the first 12-inch on herzblut not to bear his name odzin has chosen to release music that sounds like its motivating force was solely to imitate his own sound that s pretty hard to get your head around the opening page on order communitys website tells us that they make dance music that doesnt fit in a category i have every belief that holden (especially) believes this to be true but the resultant order/traum/herzblut nu-prog mini-genre is now a full-blown sound of its own with its own visionaries imitators and hangers-on itll be interesting to see who comes out on the other end when listeners get tired of listening to endless variations on the same trick if they havent already
summer will never go away will it 40 releases on the uk baroque label and for this special moment we get a colossal of a release in s seragaki on this remix disc producer guru quivver delivers his trademark sci-fi journey of space and beyond while the men of (jon taylor and keith gordon) takes us for a mourning sunrise in their re-warped version of the original prior to this release i honestly didn t know anything about these two lads but now i m going to make a point to i swear i thought the producers behind this were from asia (most likely from japan) but how wrong was i a lesson to be learned again never judge a book by its cover lavished in japanese melodies and gentle softness don t you love it when the sun rises for the early mourning giving you gorgeous rays of light warming your heart and giving you life; that s how taylor and gordon s sunrise mix makes you feel alive and loving everyecond of it you know i remember a time when trance music was good when it wasn t like how it is now; a time where the music filled your lungs with emotions and it could conjure up thoughts of love and peace while still feeding you a spiritual mindfvck that opened your eyes and mind into newfound understanding listening to this mix makes me feel like that again and it ll be the same for you as well just listen and be possessed by that celestial guitar breakdown while a poetic key change brings you back to earth while something you never do is doubt john graham s ability to create something so blissful and euphoric that it makes you believe your living a dream the quivver mix is stunning with it s ethereal chords deep subversive bass notes and floating melodies this atmospheric excursion is something entirely different than any of the other remixes for this track quivver rides a wave of tension building it slowly and provocatively yet never releasing the pressure in an impulsive manner cutting up the japanese female vocals adds to the dimension of space that s surrounding you you ll begin to wonder what reality your in as the percussion envelopes you deeper and deeper until the track xpands and subtly explodes at its climax one side for the summer the other for your mind make no mistake; this deserves every bit of praise
its a porterhouse frenzy over at the fade records camp of late with putting out his first ever mix compilation porterhouse - a whopping 26 tracks from s p and the extended porter family - tweaked and packed into just over an hour in his now trademark style of steroidic house beats funk fueled energy and sprinkling of magic thats shaking dancefloors in just about every corner of the globe the takes a look at four of steves own tracks that appeared on the mix funk theory has a moody combination of deep stabby synths working about the high octane house grooves over this a wash of feel good funk controls the flow as cut up vocals add to the pace developing fully in places and twisting about constantly in various combinations theres rich melodies imitating each other pushing up the pressure with new sounds being introduced and keeping our interest right till the end hulkinator kicks ass from the onset as twangy bassline and warpy piano chords meld together as layer after layer of jackin percussion and subtle old skool vocal samples emphasize the euphoria contained above it junk in the trunk isnt as intense but gathers itself at a slower pace oozing a charismatic groove that has you hooked from the start looping wah guitars and wild west pianos control the party vibe from start to finish making what is quite a sumptuous affair fountainia wraps up the ep with more of the same creating yet another exciting concoction out of elevating synths foot shuffling rhythms infectious melodies and eerie vocals for added pleasure porters sound continues to take on new proportions infecting our minds with a nu-generation of no-holds barred dancefloor music taking on a life of its own its definatly a must to check out the full porterhouse compilation as this ep is just a taste
its been a remarkable summer for the desolat dj played more gigs across more clubs in ibiza than ever before and held down her small but successful the gang residency at sirocco each without question shes currently one of the most popular in-form jocks on the international circuit whats most striking however is that shes achieved all this with only a handful of releases to her name her latest ep and her first for sees her debut on guy gerbers opens with the type of weighty driving groove that forms the basis of s sets s assertive vocals give the record some life resulting in a simple solid club track round is more interesting melding a sprightly bassline to plump kicks and c s warped vocal snippets kept upright by militant snares the track plays to the deeper and more twisted side of s performances s productions have a way to go if theyre to rival the dizzying heights of her djing but if or perhaps when that time comes shell be an unstoppable force
production quality isn t everything illed as a beefed up version of compressed which was released in limited numbers on rush hour last year is obviously the work of youthful producers the bass is slightly too bulbous the structure a bit ramshackle but when you ve got ideas this good that s hardly a dealbreaker put simply this is enormous rimming with ideas and a kind of na ve sense of delight at the possibilities of techno is all stomp and shimmer: a low end that stops and starts like a lost tourist in new york and a high end made from shards of synthesizer that bounce off the architecture like sunlight ut the peaks are at the three- and six-minute points when those synths jump up an octave: suddently the track seems like a stop-motion shot of a busy city street both rushed and slowed at the same time pure energy on the flip redshape s remix is louder harder and yes more technically well produced but somehow as with a lot of redshape productions it s also slightly monotonous and joyless where the original was tentative this is relentless replacing yuro trago s casual alignments with a straight-ahead detroit-ish pulse not that the dancefloor will mind of course but if you re after something less slick and more innocent stick with the
the best of the deep house revival has been extraordinarily pleasant music which makes it almost impossible to identify what it does so well taken out of the context of the set of your favorite warm-up dj this stuff could just as easily be soundtracking your decision to go with the beige or red dish cloth at your local pottery barn lets face it: oftentimes if you traded an indian sample for someone talking about how real this house sound is wed be pretty close to buddha bar territory rides this uncomfortable line with each release and knows it hidden on the flipside of this 12-inch is a man (okpara himself ) talking about how deep house sounds stiiiiiiiiiiill sweeeeet the monologue gets increasingly funny and stream-of-consciousness-heavy as the track goes on but its a one-note conceptual gag ala techno vocals bound to infuriate and delight in equal measure like houles joke the actual track is conceptual rigorous a brilliant example of the form its sending-up lovely dubby chords float over some suitably in-the-pocket drum programming im still not sure whether its brilliant or terrible then again im still listening to it which i suppose is the point on the front side however things arent quite so funny okpara plays directly into the clich s he acknowledges on on tribal vocals some congas and an unimaginative bass-and-drum combo work the magic of staying ignorable for more than seven minutes like nekes remix which graces the flip with its a track that revels in its stasis waiting for something anything to take it elsewhere these two tunes are exemplars of this mini-genre based on stasis a transition to or from johnny ds orbitalife started as a segue after all and as a result sounds like the most boring thing in the world outside of the context of a dj set put it in a pottery barn though soma
colognes justus k hncke cuts a comparatively understated figure within s sizeable roster by no means prolific but steadily consistent the german is best known for the label-defining anthem 2 after 909 with classics such as advance yacht and also to his name first released in 2004 are now repackaging the original version of alongside two remixes from the self-proclaimed hip-house originator tyree and studio bauhaus member axel steeping his buoyant interpretation in windy city nostalgia takes the originals bassline down several notches before installing a deep assembly of signature chords and a circling patter of hand percussion while the americans assured version is perhaps a little safe crafts an altogether more abstract work thats propelled by low-end groove and hazy delays
is a producer that hails from belfast in ireland and it was his track funk system that first put him on the scene and in dj boxes owned by paul van dyk as well as seb fontaine if you are thinking then that his sound is trance then think again because this release definitely has a chunky house feel to it gravity pull is first up and it features some solid drums and a gutsy baseline that builds the track for the first half now the track then sees a horn sound appear building into the baseline and for me this aspect will either win or lose some fans to be fair it isn t a cheesy horn sound you may hear in a vengaboys production but it may scare some people off nevertheless otherwise this track is pretty solid and one fit for a loud sound system girl on the flip is another one of those tracks that should definitely work on a loud sound system pretty solid drums meet a funky baseline and a filtered vocal line but it s the groove of the track that is sure to work as it flows smoothly and has a nice little funky edge to it the title really suggests the audience this track is intended for a pretty good release for convert with both tracks working quite well definitely not boring and with plenty of groove this is sure to please many budding dj s
from downtempo atmospherics on the a-side to blinding chunky breaks on the flip this 12 has it all aussie trio infusion - recently signed by adam freelands marine parade label - team up with gwill morris to turn s super-chilled original into a dancefloor monster an immense breakdown and drop will guarantee arms in the air while wailing guitar sounds and driving beats keep the party rocking turn this one up loud and itll hit you where it hurts

just when you think the downtempo compilation market is running out of steam along comes another winner to reinforce the longevity of this genre mind you to pigeon-hole nomads as chill-out would be a disservice to the variety and vibrancy on show here no way is this a cheesy cash-in its pick of genuinely sought out horizontal grooves with a strong asian flavour compiled and mixed by jimmy jazz a couple of the names will be familiar - nitin sawhney jah wobble and fragile state for instance - but the majority were new to me the inviting spaced-out cocktail of dzihan kamiens just you and i was a particular highlight also sunils calcutta which sounds like an old school ambient track gillespies oblique is another well worth catching driven by a booming bass under cool keyboard tones sawhneys sunset is a beguiling vocal track and jah wobbles bill laswell collaboration alsema dub is spiced up with trumpets drifting in and out of focus nomads is perfect late night material and something well worth exploring theres not a dud track in sight

london duo rocketnumbernine comprising brothers en (keyboards) and tom page (drums) first collaborated with kieran hebden in 2010 when he remixed their superbly propulsive matthew and toby hebden met the band through his sometime collaborator steve reid and in the tumbling jazzy intensity of tom pages percussion you sense that hebden has found a successor to the late great reid who passed away just a fortnight before this recording was made cut in a single take without any sort of computer intervention and produced by floating points these tracks show the deep mutual understanding that has developed between three musicians who have gigged intensively together (the titles of these tracks refer to venues they have played supporting radiohead) oth tracks plumb the uncharted channels between jazz rock and electronics is the broodier of the two en pages organ meanders beneath the surface of the mix while hebden shines a torchlight of lucidity in the murky depths they explore on the pace quickens keyboards scatter like petals over a nagging one-note riff whose texture shifts as the track ebbs and swells more please

marcus worgull and peter pardeike are good at writing drama into their songs but lately theyve been chipping away at the edifice of this approach on their first outing for the muwekma ep alongside other label regulars in 2012 they created a warbling synth epic salam with a mid-range that could have filled an airfield they pared down the more euphoric aspects of that track on 2013s lenoix distilling the same sense of urgency into a more manageable size feels looser and more self-contained than its predecessor the synths arent as tightly-wound but theres a moment on the title track that sabotages the pairs newfound restraint swells with hazy melodies and moreish dewdrop notes and is just fine until the overbearing introduction of a perfunctory vocal and a wailing synth line otherwise its a typically elegant house record though theres little to separate it from an ever-growing number of such tracks more distinctive is whose sullen melody channels something between a drive ost cut and a gypsy folk song s less-is-more approach suits worgull and pardeike; the flabbier aspects of less so
four records in and dreamy still seems the best way to describe since opening last year the russian label has managed to achieve this aesthetic from several different angles 1 was full of glassy organs and resonant bass; 2 had nature-like ambience and intricate drumming; 3 was built upon cheerful nostalgic synths s effort is different again offering up bottom-heavy house and gauzy insubstantial melodies but as before things remain well-arranged pretty and organic-sounding underpinned by muffled lopsided percussion is the sees siren-like synths thats the greek kind not a fire truck wending their way through cascading chords is similarly restrained warbling notes accentuating the borders of intricately-arranged hats and claps vocal sample that infrequently joins the fray is also quite nice remaining two tracks really let loose targeting the dance floor much more directly mar ya almost sounds like the work of moomin delayed chimes and scuffling percussion constantly interacting without seeming to change their identities much meanwhile has just a hint of jack to it with fat drums carrying washed-out chords and elegant strings gently forward
the reappearance of j rg burger and wolfgang voigt s legendary musical collaboration in 2007 was seen as something of a second coming for techno and perhaps even more so for the cologne sound in general in truth though apart from the extensive touring to positive reviews the non-clubbing world has had little chance to see what the duo have to offer this second time around to date theres only been one ep a track on total 8 and a remix for gudrun gut in contrast to last years aforementioned bring trance back ep floats rather than drives towards an altogether new sound the melody of all three tracks borrows heavily from guitar samples so much so that closer aus ends up sounding more like a fuzzed-out indie blissout than a b-side to a techno single fans of early spiritualized might find solace in the slowly accumulating crescendo of repetitive guitar strumming gnarly psychedelic undertow and washed out vocals but when they all come together the effect is mesmerising and totally addictive (although not particularly danceable despite the steady beat) however isnt nearly as captivating named after a square in cologne s gnesviertel bohemian district its an almost totally ambient track save its jangly jazzy guitar riff the track neither sounds good (despite the fact that its almost overproduced) nor does it carry the mood can you blame boomkat for humorously describing it as chris isaak techno if you are looking for something to dance to title track (red square) is where youll need to head but dont get too excited: its hardly set for peak time either the beat is slow sensual and blissfully lost with plenty of pop ambience to give it a dreamy feel the twangy guitar lick almost seems too sticky to run with the smooth flow but the main keyboard riff overlays it beautifully the little touches on the snares and the bubbling chemical background slowly pull you into the slow eyes-closed lullaby causing goose pimples to rise like ripples in a puddle of rain
tort bali team up for the next release on the spanish based is the release and it comes armed with two mixes for the more progressive minded out there part 1 has a bit of a chunky feel from the word go with some strong drums and a gritty bassline the track builds with some smooth pads and as the sounds intensify around the production the drums and basslines gradually build it has a classic progressive feel to it with some superb basslines and a real great flow quality stuff part 2 also has a nice flow to it the basslines are again very solid deep and quite tough while the sounds around it are reminiscent of satoshi tomiie s love in traffic swirling and a little twisted another solid production in a very good release here on

reductive as it sounds there are essentially two modes that hans-peter lindstr m works in: pop and prog each invariably comes with rich instrumentation and galactic disco trappings but the results arent always the same for all of his fearless expeditions into kaleidoscopic prog the norwegian artist sounds most at home when crafting sparkling dance-pop nuggets lindstr ms first solo production in two years folds those proclivities together and the results hearken back to some of his best work there are four versions of here including two edits an instrumental and an extended version that serves as the original single everything is credited to lindstr m grace hall but if it were revealed that the skin town singer had only been sampled for no one would think twice about it short vocal phrases punctuate this windswept dance track peppered more as harmony and texture than verse and chorus but they nonetheless add a pop-minded sheen to the nine-minute mini-epic like a bolder and brighter interpretation of lets practise or a more patient so much fun marries discos unyielding energy with lindstr ms inherent urge to find just how far he can take a single groove and melodic theme it turns out he still hasnt found his limit
its been a year and a half since the last ep from canblaster a former video game soundtrack composer and current member of pariss club cheval collective his newest offering is a six-track collaboration with the norwegian producer lido for a belgian label thats released music from artists like sinjin hawke and cashmere cat the ep features many canblaster hallmarks: a high-strung theatricality humorous pop tropes and a tendency towards twists and turns which make his music feel fast-paced but not scatter-brained the sound design is masterly throughout as weve come to expect from canblaster you can hear how his years spent composing video game soundtracks have shaped his sound the strength of the record is its combination of pop caliber production and a knack for songwriting which shines through in the sophisticated phrasing and cadences of and the eps opening track 6:59 an appropriately over-the-top prelude beyond its technical elements has a light conceptual side with poignant but not overbearing references to millennial pop culture the standout title track sounds like an homage to the late period of uk garage the age of daniel bedingfield and artful dodger when the sound bubbled over into big-budget radio tracks the eps weakest moments sounds more like lido and less like canblaster with occasional forays into the more formulaic alt-r b remix sound on tracks like or which sounds like cashmere cat but with a slightly more abstract bent overall however its refreshing to hear two producers persevering within the liminal zone between hip-hop club and bass music while skirting the clich s that mark many similar projects
omar-s once stated that his music sounds best when played super-loud because thats the setting its created with the same is probably true of this four-track ep at least in that its far more electrifying with the speakers way up as with speedy js armstrong on clr last year its a purely atavistic experience unfortunately however the same level of finesse just isnt present the original of for example sees sheer power triumph over subtlety laced violently with something akin to low-pitched scratching and textured by grainy hissing percussion its impressive but eventually seems overdone dj hi-shocks version takes the same clay and shapes it with more skill to focus on the throbbing apocalyptic low-end is to find it inexplicably morphing with each loop: an auditory illusion however whats exciting is the additions finkes grainy percs have been made even harsher while a heavily de-tuned piano half way enhances the depraved feel most importantly though theres both subtlety and oomph conversely a man once comfortable with harder sounds mark seems strangely out of depth with static hi-hats and smothered bell-hits showing little progression throughout his six minute take go s choppy quasi-breaks revision also suffers from the same ailment and while credit is due for attempting a remix of this nature it removes the most vital element found on this release: floor-stomping appeal
the 2nd disc of pathwork ep continues the good foundations set by the first disc two more productions with one featuring the vocal talents of miss pheonixx and another acapella contribute to this disc up out of here featuring miss pheonixx begins with the trademark drum patterns of randall as well as some deep grinding baselines the male vocals of miss pheonixx (yes i m confused too) also chatter along in the background while the track builds in its early stages the flow of the arrangement is pretty smooth with the baseline keeping the track moving along quite nicely for the duration as well as the interesting comments by pheonixx in and out of love maintains a deep flow for its duration with its deep base tones vocal pads and subtle bouncy baselines the flow in this track is very effective though with the use of sounds and effects rolling in and out with good precision solid house music is the way here the up and out of here acapella follows for the dj tool fans 2 pretty good tunes complimenting the first disc nicely this release is definitely more then just a tease until the 4 milestone 50 releases for bedrock
reducing old soul among other styles to a cog in the machine is the best possible thing techno can do for the classics it gives them and a listener weary of hearing them in more obvious contexts some breathing room take the lead track on the first ep by venezuelan producer-dj on his confrere bloody marys dame-music (brito did vocal duties on marys great sed non satiata from last year and has sung for senor coconut on tour so he knows a thing or two about honoring history by messing with it ) over fractured plinking guitar and percussion brito drops in edwin starrs vocal from his 1970 motown classic war fragmenting its holy fervor to shift the songs priorities to emphasize romantic calamity mining a hit as obvious as war skirts kitsch as a rule but britos approach is too saucy and playful to be reduced to mere sentimentality the two b-sides offer more of the same jacking grooves occasional odd rhythmic emphases and insouciant air as the gooses its minimalist arrangement with steady bass and clipped-bordering-on-slivered percussion int makes its presence felt with thick slurping hi-hats and darting bass that move the track while found-sound fragments dot it lovingly and overdriven horns buoy its end

mario basanovs latest release as will be familiar to just about anyone who has maintained an interest in house music of late a limited release in may on basanovs co-owned boso label now re-released by has been one of the summers most ubiquitous tracks at five-and-a-half minutes its shorter than your average track with a brief introductory section swiftly ushering in languorous orchestral background textures and the parping central horn riff whether because of the familiarity of the track or the ingredients is almost militant in its refusal to surprise this doesnt hit the spot in quite the same way as gotham or requiem did but a b+ track is still a treat and its popularity over the past few months has been deserved the b-side is a sub-three-minute radio edit that by its very existence underlines basanovs recent successes
some people just can t be rushed for love or money like norwegian space disco pioneer lindstr m who embarked on this 12 battle with groundbreaking british techno dude riton a year ago with a fabulous split vinyl comprising by lindstr m on one side and young girl by riton on the other seconds out (or months more like) and round two was shaping up to be a belter riton filed a stormer of a remix of and then lindstr m well they re still waiting for lindstr m s contribution he s clearly a busy guy but in the meantime battle has quite sensibly decided to go ahead and release the remix on its own anyway while it s still hot the fluffy spaced-out grooves of the original have been fortified with a chrome-plated super-slick treatment from riton whose current output particularly in the remix field is pretty much unstoppable the result is a blissful midpoint between i feel space superpitcher and ellen llien s more dancefloor-led moments with an emphasis on lush sugar-coated synth i ll eagerly await the final arrival of lindstr m s answer which could still knock the socks of this but meanwhile excellent remix perfect for a mid-set mood-lifter more than justifies the whole project on its own
pulse ones return to granulart the label that released his first 12-inch from less than three years ago catches the buenos aires techno producer aka emanuel peralta in a monochromatic mode his other records such as the two strong eps hes released through dasha rushs fullpanda have often been highlighted by melodic atmospheric tunes and tangents toward airy electro and idm but banging big-room cuts hinged on huge kick drums are the order of the day on features an endlessly pulsating 3/4 riff la mike parker and a series of steam blasts that offer an easy dramatic effect the title track has a reverberated clap adding drama amidst a buzzing tangle of acidic synths and the digital-only madness add subtlety and color even as they stick to darker shades with its echoed 303s and moody undertones madness with its cascade of nervous synth riffs which makes the heft of the drums feel almost overbearing at times orphxs remix sees the canadian duo emerging from silence and working up to a fever pitch with serrated percussion frantic acid contortions and scorched-atmosphere effects it has the most personality of the bunch peraltas originals are solid dj tackle but given the adventurous stuff hes made elsewhere weve come to expect more
masaaki yoshida is a japanese musician whose records are inspired by his live shows where he crafts tunes from scratch using a sampler and a keyboard to date hes generally focused his energies on making downtempo beats but his latest effort a 10-inch for finds him playing around with upbeat african rhythms s sleeve offers a good visual approximation of the music contained within: anthony pappones photograph gloriously captures a dancer in colourful garb flinging themselves backwards at a festival in d dougou burkino faso s title track is a busily percussive slab of afro-house you could imagine joe claussell throwing down to raucous cheers theres no build up instead were parachuted into a fiesta of junkyard drums and vocal chants is one of the prettiest house tunes ive heard this year like mo kolours at 120 bpm it opens with a sweet marimba rhythm thats soon joined by a gently oscillating bass tone the two b-side cuts are more reliant on driving swells of low-end both and are pleasant enough but they lack the verve of the a-side ( s vocal sample begins to grate after a couple of minutes ) still i get the feeling these two tracks like all of s music are best experienced live combine yoshidas dextrous on-stage presence with this dance floor-friendly evolution in his sound and youve got an artist worth keeping an eye on
are a duo from portland oregon and their pacific northwest home is not the only thing the pair has in common with liz harris of grouper fame work with a similarly noisy dark and vocal-led version of droning ambience with synth and guitar forming a cavernous backdrop where harris tenderly keeps to the undergrowth with increasingly subtle and complex work attempt to rise above the ground in a display of glorious transcendence its clear that barbara kinzle and birch cooper have a hugely ambitious bent music on is infused with a dogmatic sacred air choral qualities of the vocals the chant on opening track the omnipresent organ tones they all suggest a holy setting dark gaudy majesty of their textures evoke a similarly opulent image on those textures are impossibly pure almost too rich for their own good yre beautiful to experience but forbidding too suggesting a world you cant enter a pair of pearly gates locked shut kinzle and cooper attempt to build a cathedral of particular sonic perfection starting with a roof arching triumphantly for the sky unfortunately they seem to have forgotten about the foundation weakening their whole structure in the process while the dark tone hints at black and doom metal influences and the harsh wash of guitar towards the end of is a thrilling moment of blackened adrenaline the dread intensity danger and weight required to channel that aesthetic just arent present instead the music floats by without much consequence lacking the fire-and-brimstone passion it so desperately needs to hit home it suggests heaven without a chance of hell a one-sided equation that winds up in a type of limbo technically is unimpeachable; beautifully crafted and layered to perfection however it lacks the raw bite that coopers recent solo work has in spades the sense of risk and recklessness right on the edge of losing control its that missing quality which can force gloom to turn apocalyptic and then become something to truly stand in awe of whatever the results
you can tell from the packaging alone that a lot of love went into the latest ep on from (aka prince of denmark) record comes in transparent tissue paper with hand-painted gold marks riffing off a black-and-white image of clouds artwork on the record itself is a blurry close-up of waves at sunset a screen-grab from the video made for his track re will be ecstasy music itself lives up to this delicate presentation likes dramatic vocal samples something that made parts of his album mothercave a bit awkward but that really works this time though just the right side of cloying the title track and are both disarmingly sincere on a heavy deep house groove charges forward while an unsteady male voice croaks what sounds like dont cry even when the road is hard soon followed by a house diva who adds m gonna do all the things on a submerged melody creates a feeling of epiphany while a man gives an account of suddenly becoming religious after years of recreational drug use ts a moving story (whatever your beliefs) and in the mostly atheist and drug-taking world of dance music a provocative choice (you have to wonder what effect it would have on a dance floor when the talk of acid and ecstasy suddenly gives way to we need to give our lives to jesus ) other two tracks are more understated is early morning music but not in the party sense this is the soundtrack to you alone in your apartment at 5 am with a gentle beat nudging sad chords reluctantly forward t is a subtle ambient piece comprising little more than flickering keys a windy swoosh -ing sound and buddha machine-style drones altogether the record is somber entrancing and certainly some of this intriguing producers best stuff yet

s 2011 album +dome was a highly distinctive piece of work an exploration of the space between bass music and experimental rock it had creative verve and remarkable self-assurance what could have easily turned into a baggy sprawl unfolded with its own irresistible internal logic as the sydney-based group explored the possibilities of that crossover with scant self-indulgence s third album is still very much the work of a highly intelligent and self-disciplined trio whose gift for ear-worm melodies is now at the fore in all other respects though its a completely different record a set of lean pop-tinged tracks that draw from rock as well as dance music (percussionist alex cameron is on vocal duties with his smoky indie croon) its a reinvention that recalls new orders after joy division s current sound ranges from melancholy house music to ruminative neo-folk layered with winning sonic detail tracks like illustrate how are operating on a different level of complexity from their peers its percussion as fluid as running water could only be the work of a band steeped in bass music and r b but one that is clearly looking beyond modern scenes for its inspiration listen to those klezmer-like brass and woodwind interventions you will find such lan at every turn even the weakest track the festival-ready is elevated by its rhythmic slipperiness and jaunty woodwind elsewhere hits real heights draws from the hardcore continuum palette with the same heartbreaking effect as james blake takes dubsteps lazer-like synth stabs and bowel-quaking bass and turns it into music of real delicacy and restraint seems to unfold back-to-front switching between plunging bass and downcast indie guitars as if it were the most natural thing in the world sudden and repeated stylistic switchbacks in and are the kind of exhilarating sleights of hand that keep sounding fresh no matter how many times you listen to it late introduction of a simple organ pad on that track is one of the most exciting things you will hear in same could be said of a wonderfully enigmatic slice of deep house propelled by effervescent popping garage rhythms its a track that could have come out on either kompakt or hyperdub are neither a dance act nor an indie band instead they are out there on their own doing something else which by their next album they may well have abandoned either way i will be listening
with the jungle revival in full swing you might expect s to be a rave-referencing slice of retroism instead this latest release from the mancunian duo is true to form industrial techno pushed to its limits where snippets of hardcore lie buried in distortion and noise its like watching footage of a warehouse rave on a vhs thats degraded almost entirely to static continuing on the lets-go-harder path thats taken them from the polished chilly techno of their early releases on horizontal ground to the overdriven neo-gabber of recent releases on their self-titled imprint the three tracks here show little respect for mixing desk niceties the kicks crack and buckle in ways that make someone like delroy edwards grit sound polite by comparison on and each off-beat pulse thuds in so hard that the rest of the track has to dip around it with both the wailing synths of the former and piston hi-hats of the latter recoiling as though punched before springing back into the mix is cleaner its roiling percussion recalls shed at his most militaristic with synths that ring through a fog of static and a buzzing like trapped wasps it could cause clubbers to try and wave away phantom insects if that is any djs got the balls to drop something this brutal
london based label had a banner year in 010 topping off endless critical acclaim with the first volume of their series but in 011 and the first half of 01 they seemed to focus on white labels and barebones club music; they were still active and certainly still good but no longer at the forefront of uk dance music n halfway through last year something changed dropped another ep of his inimitable style with club rez a suddenly ubiquitous proved he was an incredibly imaginative dj and finally released his first album a dazzling collection of glassy fragments and other assorted sharp ends and the cherry on top a second compilation this time though it doesnt feel like a victory lap so much as the start of a new chapter like the first edition vol is partly a round up of last years best tracks and partly a collection of new club anthems among the familiar highlights are the brutal eskibeat slam of s s shapeshifting and particularly s previously available only on vinyl s track is a perfect embodiment of the latter day ethos: he makes a mountain out of a molehill with just a few drum sounds and an uncannily synth boiling down the idea of club music to a clear genre less aperitif its dead simple and all the more expansive for it new material is every bit as promising on the poppier end of things extends the outro of last years where shooting star synths dance on slabs of sub bass like nimble ballerinas while provides his version of a ballad with the uncharacteristically restrained delivers a strait laced banger in and the whole gang team up for a mix of s stripping it of its sickly sweet pop treacle and making a screw faced monster out of it most hearteningly american newcomer morri finally gets a proper release just like he fetishizes the holographic allure of southern rap beats but fastens them to a distinctly american hip hop template whose breezy synths ive already seen described as chill trap addition of another geographically distant producer whose music sounds so identifiably is proof of the labels worldwide influence as well as its continued a r excellence
s grizzled productions sounded right at home on apron but theyre also proving to be comfortable travellers having dropped in on unknown the unknown they now surface in rotterdam on the excellent what these labels share are parallel desires to entertain and unsettle and the london producers latest does both usually in the same track the opening salvo is lighter though thats a relative concept on willkommen strangled metallic hits jostle with a tinny bassline and holds the crowded feel for as long as possible seems more pleasant but theres an undercurrent of menace to its chords which couldve been lifted from a queasy hype williams pastorale the unsettling aspect dominates the b-side whose three tracks sound baked and broken is garage turned ghoulish its 2-step shuffle a deathly crawl beneath static crackles and a bassline heavy with slasher-flick dread on the even stranger hi-hats run themselves ragged while a kick drum thuds its sluggish halftime below those two bookend the eps banger a grandiose title for sure but its easy to imagine old nick wincing at this merciless rager
is the techno alias of the dutch house producer makam since 2012 hes been dropping shadowy 12-inches on his eponymous label while playing tantalisingly rare club dates which included berghain in 2014 dekmantel and a handful of other venues hes not in it for the prestige so s online presence is minimal hes not building a brand here the project is about the music doomy techno with a mystical allure and its latest record which lands almost two years after the last was worth the wait stomps ominously through an atmosphere choked with evil spirits a guttural tribalistic chant is your spirit guide on this dark and tunnelling trip is tense claustrophobic and demented what sounds like rave stabs are transmogrified into a pressurised roar in the background melodramatic cinema-style drum rolls build suspense while freaky sax squalls and a haunted melody adds a delirious narrative projects s otherworldliness back onto the floor the mood is unsettling is that a wolfs howl human or something else back there but the shuffling beat keeps your body locked into the dance even when your mind is spirited off elsewhere the best bit about is that big crashing sound what is that looping ad infinitum sinister details like this make s techno so enticing
jake has been a presence in ristols underground for some time but it feels like hes only hit his stride in the past year his work as one half of deep house duo outboxx while often excellent is more retro-minded handful of solo releases meanwhile have seen him searching for a sound to call his own with limited success its only since collaborating with peverelist on ells that has found a more original response to the ristolian aesthetic the ensuing resolve / prototype fear all junglist clatter and darkside atmospherics felt right at home alongside the likes of pev and kowton but brought some new ideas to the table too fittingly s latest arrives courtesy of livity sound sub-label has few frills theres barely any textural or rhythmic detail beyond whats necessary and certainly no narrative surprises just a muscular syncopated groove a la pev that rolls on and ever on in the wrong hands it might be dull but theres such an immense weight and intensity that its difficult not to get swept along is craftier its almost resolve part two the same scattergun snares and distortion-crunched hi-hats feature but in this configuration the groove is more stable highlighting s debts to uk funky s with fellow dnuos signees atu and lex coulton it feels like hes fleshing out the livity canon without challenging its basic tenets
function and syndenham revive their partnership with a reworking of s stone cold acid classic served up for them s occasional series delving into gems from the past the duos approach is to use elements of poindexters signature acidic motif freshening it up with sputnik bleeps barking percussive prods and an underlying bass storm on his lonesome function keeps much of the originals 909 drum programming intact but takes it deeper and dubbier with oscillating single-note swells and eerie late night chords the 23-year-old original is included too and while its production understandably sounds somewhat opaque in comparison to the remixes its headfuck levels of menace and intensity remain thrillingly undimmed
eric estornels forthcoming second album as is about his newborn son who its also named after such a premise could translate to the classic domestic bliss record the kind thats usually softer happier and more introspective than what came before it and judging from its first single could very well be that presents one of the weepier tracks in estornels catalog sounds melancholic with its post-punk guitars and downtrodden bassline throw in the vocoder and its like a complete inversion of say skreams fatherhood anthem anticipate its an attractive enough track but the vocals hit it like a wet blanket making it more of a ham-fisted attempt at serious music on the other hand was apparently inspired by estornels recent trip to movement with his son unabashedly cheesy its nine minutes of throbbing techno with rimshots that burst like fireworks and a white noise climax thatd make dubfire double fist-pump and that energy mostly works in its favor: doesnt have the measured approach of its counterpart but it does sound far more celebratory
the question of how best to launch a label is tricky one especially when said imprint already has some kind of associated reputation in the case of that reputation was formed with a cultish series of east london parties and further established by remix work for some fairly heavy-hitting pop acts so here co-founder answers the aforementioned question by busting out a roland a juno and doing his very best murk impression nd a damn fine impression it is too his echoing bassline and soft swirly pads sound pretty much indistinguishable from some of the better examples of the genre from 20 years back waze s remix doesnt sound much more current although thats clearly not the aim here relentless looping of the vocal adds a bit more energy and theres a deliciously severe synth blast that joins the party mid-break but its more of a club edit than a remix proper finally for those of you who think that a house retrospective of this nature isnt complete without a light splattering of acid youre in luck legendary s remix has it in droves all tightly packed in between snappy hats and thunderously throbbing low-end
a writer friend described s as folk techno and i winced theres a tendency among reviewers to lumber anything vaguely home-crafted or ethnic with this hokey term but after listening to more i now have to concede that he was correct folk is by definition something which stems organically from the lives and beliefs of ordinary people if the task here were to provide a one-word review of s third album it would have to be organic is inarguably a home studio hand-crafted and folky affair yet its also an album that reveals at a creative peak and at a convergence of her previous excursions into ambient dub techno experimental house and electronica the programming is constructed entirely with analog equipment and is wedded to s percussion vocals keys and guitar the albums early tracks and bloom in real time with a dizzying amount of dissonant elements added one after the other modifying and renewing discordant floating bass tones jazz syncopation poly- or non-rhythmic percussion vocals hushed and whispered or full-bodied and full-force: its not an easy marriage but the end result is equal parts strange and breathtaking periodically it plunges into deep-sea textures and moods reminiscent of the aqua-dub techno of her early releases for traum fishes is an otherworldly and all-too-brief inner-ear treasure and is an extended underwater journey with psychedelic whispers lurching bass and aqueous drums explorations of more traditional techno structures are likewise undertaken by the right side of the brain like elipsia a subtle masterpiece with an overlapping shimmering patchwork of synths which morph from fluid and nebulous to staccato and finely divided and back again risks are taken with mixed results fallic could be tricky circa 1998 when he still made nonsensical sense with the type of haunted blunted beats and distorted guitar drone that masters here elsewhere the woodpecker percussion and caterwauling of is distracting and is a sticking point a gentle and faithful cover of mazzy stars fade into you its unfortunately accompanied by what may actually be a couple of saucepans and a wooden spoon and would have been divine if just reduced to her subtle electronic whirs and burrs the dreamy melody and her voice percussion acts as a red thread throughout a common line of reference that melds and moulds to each new setting is it traditionally chilean quite frankly i have no idea but its hard to imagine that the inspiration for it within such an authentic and personal album would originate elsewhere is risky dense and adventurous but there is never any sense that is anything but quietly calmly and knowingly in control of all her elements and the result is nothing short of magnificent

are among the most consistent purveyors of minimal slanted tech house around but theyve hardly achieved this by blurring genre boundaries or anything like that; instead they stick to their guns exactingly bumping grooves powered by simple excellently produced hooks and not much is different with so now do we judge it against their current body of work or against everyone elses the thing is the second is pretty straightforward: its yet another clutch of tracks which stray close to being perfect in some kind of technical non subjective sense the first though is a bit more of a complex matter and more useful critically because the greater closeness of comparison offers precision its also because there is plenty of notable variation throughout their oeuvre and its not like theyre completely repeating themselves here the title track has lyrics that support the music underneath (or is that the other way around ) on some subconscious undefinable but very real level in the same way as charly but rather than pushing us inexorably through rising paranoia they navigate us through smooth waves of trance like blue up a gear for with percussive blippery halting every so often for four dense commanding chords that descend upon us before slamming the track back in you wish it would happen again and again and again but these guys are too clever for that and youre left wanting meanwhile is definitely one of the if not the most high energy tracks theyve released firmly in techno territory with a smoky stroboscopic rtefacts type feel: rough cracks vibrating bass and an urgent lead with the filter opening and closing with intent thats the verdict description wise but rating wise well these tracks at the more classic end of pots catalogue classic strong and timely this approach then may not have the kind of slap round the head surprisingness to elevate the tracks to the very top of either the pile or the charts but certainly has the buoyancy to enable them to float very respectably in both
you may recall flowers nd sea creatures from their time on buzzin fly a few years back but despite the promise of their brooding debut for ben watts label the montreal duo didnt quite kick on as they could have done more recently vocalist graham baxter and kosta megalos have been collaborating with dance floor talents comes a year after the canadians first rubbed shoulders with frances dj yellow on the original mix of may be on the b-side but its no inferior product despite the strength of the remixes baxters rich falsetto lends itself to the slow-burning malevolence of the rhythm track where a dark bass hum acts like an undertow pulling jagged depeche mode-style synths and hissing hi-hats into its vortex tuff (gerd janson and philip lauer) also dial into that 80s synth pop sound as well as leaning towards one of its progenitors coldwave featuring a simple heavy bass riff and trilling high notes its retro without being pastiche yet the pick of the bunch comes from konstantin whose remix works elements of david bowies merica into a dubby disco storm with just the right amount of camp its another strong indicator that is one to watch
i dont want to be a part of her dark side eleni adamopoulou has said of her native city athens i want to keep this citys light alive inside of me and share it its an attitude that is abundantly present on adamopoulous debut release as which seems intent on countering the citys financial and political woes with some good old-fashioned escapism cant is a bubblegum take on new york house the organ stabs light and frothy the fractured diva samples pitched up until they coo like cartoon doves and theres something rather warming redemptive even about the airy laser-synth chords in elsewhere adamopoulou strays into fractionally moodier terrain this is after all is more introspective but its darkness is leavened by rich uplifting chords in a manner reminiscent of the cosmic deep house of fred p is ma beat meanwhile is more uncanny than joyful its vivid sliding chords are perhaps the best evidence of adamopoulous knack for sound design throughout the types of house and techno referenced varies (the title track recalls late 00s dubsteppers flirtations with house) but the aesthetic is consistent the arrangements are restless and detail-heavy and the sounds almost rubbery adamopoulous optimism seems boundless and its difficult to resist
ernest gonzales bills his mexicans with g s project as future latin though im not entirely convinced that said project is all that latin outside of a few slight musical nods and an aztec visual theme gonzales makes good on the promise though with the official debut of new project (a collaboration with mexican beatmaker toy selectah) on ras former label of the month stylistically the tracks operate in the same nebulous hip-hop/ bass music realm as gonzales album ceremony but theyre gruffer tougher and rougher (sorry) where most of ceremony was loaded up with beautiful synth so ds to temper the percussion is all gaudy synth horns and whirring organs on top of ch ky metallic swing these tracks have a sense of space that make those drums hit even harder: the humourous replete with g shots to go with the handclaps feels like its bucking in slo-mo and the wiry synths and slams of wade in mid-air like when the levee breaks the ep is supplemented with a bevy of remixes some more remarkable than others; highlights are tectonic signee hxdbs whisper quiet remix of poppin and lol adventurous rework of that jumps into a pseudo-moombahton breakdown that never never gets any less startling its always nice to hear artists come at the whole bass music thing from a genuinely fresh angle and its no surprise to see that it also comes on one americas most imaginative labels
the latest 12 from upcoming visitors koma bones is a remix platter of cuts from a previous 12 and one from their blinding debut album blinded by science side a deadbeat (tag on a toe remix) keeping the tamra-esque vocals of the original which can be found on the album this remix sits nicely on a funky electro groove and you could be forgiven for thinking its some chicago house track this one is dancier than the original side b powercut (rewired mix) unavailable on the triple vinyl version of the album this track also gets remixed into a far dancier groove than the original which painted a quite bleak environment with some harsh bass tones and drum patterns keeping things simple this remix allows the bassline to take over getting funkdafied in the process good to see that is keeping things dancefloor as that is where most of the action takes place
even among belgiums vlek crew for whom subtlety is a keynote take things pretty far last years startup label 1 on the trios self-titled label was a pensive techno record that hovered on the brink of silence its follow-up goes even further challenging you to listen deep in order to detect the subtle currents moving beneath its inky surfaces the record starts off coy and gains confidence as it goes is three and a half minutes of skeletal dub drums around which muted toms and chord patterns lap and sway gently like shoals of tiny fish the shapes they make seem random at first but hypnotise over time on we graduate to a techno beat albeit a thin diffident one punctuated by the odd solitary bass tone once again the chords form musty clouds way back in the murk finally has a bit of pace thanks to the limpid hi-hats and claps that periodically float into the foreground it helps that theres some melody though its not much: a muted minor-key arp navigating thoughtfully between tiny bursts of ambience and sleepy feedback trails in s world this innocuous detail makes all the difference
i dont know if theres a name for this phenomenon but ive often noticed that when you play cheap or old electronic gear distorted it can convey the feeling of a powerful force like a sound that is actually too loud to be recorded properly and that is possibly causing permanent damage to the recording equipment the second track on latest ep offers an awesomely lo-fi crash that exemplifies this feeling an ultra-noisy pssssshhhtt that sounds like the drum machine is about to break on the four tracks here savas spins dirty acidic and jackin house that stays closely attuned to that singular edginess of analog gear and the mixture of fear and delight that emerges from the sense that when you play analog things can get hairy or nasty or spin out of control altogether its a reminder that getting old gear up and running and connected can make you feel a bit like doctor frankenstein yelling its alllliiivvve when the monster first sits upright a sentiment hard to come by when youre working with vst plug-ins is a much more stripped-down affair than nuclear rawmance savas last full-length also for his own imprint melodies and mood have largely been discarded leaving a bare-bones palette that comes off as classic rather than retro the title track rides the acid in a long and deep way not so much in-your-face squelch as drawn-out and sometimes abstracted down to the faintest white noise wisp is about as stripped as youre gonna get with only a big steely hi-hat and a whirling synthesizer that sounds like something from a nasa recording of outer space is the most organic feeling track here and thats because its got a conga drum loop then theres the acidic synth again tweaked expressively now flashing in the dark now disappearing again behind a curtain always with a gentlemanly sense of decorum
ive taken to listening to s once a day first thing each morning after the clatter of the alarm clock rudely awakes its a stroke down the cheek a sunbeam through the curtains a smile of reassurance to combat the morning chagrin bongo-driven beat strolls unhurriedly along this alearic beach the whoosh and bubble of tide are a palpable presence while chords anchored by a full-bodied bass hold your hand and say everythings going to be just fine longside previous release violet morning moon its hard to imagine that dan keeling is anything other than the cheeriest man on earth ive taken to smoking things i shouldnt when listening to quiet s remix a track so far out it probably does enough on its own to court substance regulation sub-bass plods meet bongo reverb and eventually the elating progression of the original only this time sans bass and beats floating in some empyrean chamber of antigravity its long with extended periods of inactivity and to the casual ear it may drag a little with a limber mind however the longer it drags the better

written somewhere between berlin and southern italy between serene azure skies and perpetual clouds s first ep for taps into a blend of balmy house and tougher techno s titular track is primed and buoyant if somewhat distracted every now and then defects for a mini reverie thats worlds apart from the clubby task at hand is more focused using what sounds like a ships bell to carry the nautical theme into a moodier dub setting a detroit-sourced tension percolates through before wraps things up with seven minutes of shimmering haze that last one is imbued with the motions of the mediterranean it rolls on and on in a lovely saline wash with the gentle tussle of something grainy underneath

you cant predict what youll get with a record and the producer certainly wields the unknown to his advantage his aloof mystique is one thing but the real crux of the matter here is misdirection: is great at leading us down one path and then explosively changing direction a minute later it provided the standout moment on last years 003 and makes for an unbeatable opening assault on 004 slowly materializes with simple kicks and gong hits setting a languorous pace then pow it detonates shooting out rivulets of noise and crunchy things in all directions it balls up and evolves into a thorny creature that mumbles digital gibberish the return of the gong brings it somewhat back in line before it liquefies and evaporates completely after that you might want something to hold onto which thankfully the rest of the ep delivers with its vocal call to arms is a formidable dash to the floor that features a much welcomed melody keys dart about like minnows on theres also percolating lightness to be found in despite it being a stony-faced affair on the whole 004 isnt so outlandish as 003 but its still subversive enough to make a hefty dent in any utilitarian dj set
say smallville to a certain sort of house music nerd and theres a good chance a pad-driven melody starts reflexively unfurling in their head s much as any dance label i can think of the hamburg imprint gives its followers exactly what they expect pads light-touch percussion stefan marx-drafted artwork from a crew of true believers one of the labels most reliable practitioners is k peter kersten whose dial label has long traded in a similar strain of dreamy house his latest ep for smallville is and it ticks all the usual boxes does it offer anything on top the answer begins with kerstens basslines theyre warm smooth and supremely low and they lend a faint but critical glimmer of tension to the formula the mix is still hazy but with a palpable rumble beneath the surface is less house music heard through weed smoke than a creeping hangover on those smallvillian pads sound hopeful but confused its individual notes never quite forming a melodic whole either with themselves or the bassline grooving underneath the combination is just as strange on the title track but kersten makes it work through sheer insistence the pads spend most of the track sustained on a single chord this time with the melody unraveling almost imperceptibly over a matter of minutes driven by a tick-tock beat feels close to straightforward though the drums occasionally trigger squiggles of psychedelic sound effects kersten has a knack for making the familiar feel unsettling and it makes both recognizably smallville and patently askew
the very exciting talent that is makes his first appearance on the german based traum imprint with his and 3 very quirky productions first up is dinamo which is a fantastic track i must say it begins very smoothly with some bouncy melodies and as the track builds smooth atmospheric elements build their way in and create a quirky and bouncy production that is full of energy this is fake at his very best with a track that is riveting for its entire 10 minutes undoing the laces turns the heat up a little as acid riffs run rife and take the track on a acid journey full of rumbling baselines and rippling hooks if acid house is your thing then this track is definitely one for you coheed concludes the ep in a smooth tech fashion with smooth humming pads crisp clattering beats and a minimal vocal pattern the beautiful smooth strings help make this track the great piece of work that is and it concludes this fantastic ep off in great style
the small exquisitely formed maintain their reputation for tracks that elegantly live their life on the peripheries of house and techno with this release from one of the labels co-owners and a fine cabal of remixers the west london-based producers original mix adopts the full widescreen effect cascading deep bass throbs and a trembling metallic clatter across a ponderous 2-step click consequences reworking wires in some heavy-ass sub-bass transmissions and a rapid-fire hi-hat rhythm before jack s late-night submission takes a clockwork 4/4 tempo and bolts a springy low-slung bassline to it accompanied by layers of velvety synth patterns mr s take is a soundtrack to some unwritten sci-fi flick pitched-down dark house which sedately moves through the void to an intruder-alarm pulse battered by dubby sonic tics and a demure-sounding kick is an ep of uniformly consistent quality where texture and atmosphere take the spotlight
mister saturday night has a knack for picking great tunes from unknowns hank jackson general ludd and nthony naples have all been responsible for corkers discovered by the new york label justin carter and eamon harkin have done it again with an ep from an alias of glaswegian producer denis sulta who scored a sizeable hit with last years its only real on numbers his debut ep for mister saturday night is characteristic of the label in more ways than one tapping into its core duality where strains of disco rub elbows with raw techno is among the strongest tracks in the mister saturday night catalogue theres a whiff of psychotic photosynthesis in the tracks upbeat synth lead and the way it seems to go on forever subtly shifting every few bars its a spacey journey from wormhole to wormhole taking us to places both hectic and calming the kind of techno track thats enthralling for all eight minutes the flipside has a completely different style its a jerky disco-informed track cobbled together from chanted vocals and funky rhythm guitar thanks to the whomping kick drum however it packs more oomph than your usual disco track: where most sample-heavy grooves like these tend to smooth things out this one brings out the edges the ep is rounded off by an interlude that doesnt make much of an impression but its two meatier tracks especially will linger long in the mind debuting on mister saturday night has almost become a rite of passage and with stuff this strong might follow the success of label-mates like nthony naples
for his debut ep on exit mostly successfully splices together fast-paced club genres for example a collaboration with is a hybrid of jungle footwork and drum bass the bounce that sample is fairly pedestrian but gets swallowed up in a flurry of clipped snares and double-time rhythms is similarly high-octane as pairs frenetic percussion with cheap-sounding synth lines and a butchered vocal sample proper on the other hand is a little bland kinetic but lacking in the soulfulness and idiosyncrasy that makes footwork so exciting the tempo and atmosphere relax on the ep closer a simple glitchy and pleasantly melodic hip-hop instrumental its is an odd fit with the other faster tracks and it seems bizarre to name an ep after the outlier but it just about works as a mellow closer

what with the rainfeeder crew and low end theory parties los ngeles may seem like californias capital of dubstep and bass music but theres also plenty going on in san francisco at the moment oth cities were fairly early adopters of the sound relative to other major us locations each building up a healthy number of club nights and homegrown producers and warp have decided to follow on from their championing of flying lotus with a snapshot of californias second city of bass is the most experienced producer of the duo here having already put his name to a number of drum bass and breakbeat releases before making the jump to 140 pm tracks on he teams up with san franciscan singer/songwriter palermo for a slice of lurching melancholy that brings to mind both the brooding electronics of the knife as well as gemmy and jokers kaleidoscopic synthesis often with tracks like this the vocal can seem like somewhat of an afterthought but palermos gliding tones seem to emphasise sedate half time groove while s multiple synth layers provide the necessary dynamic flux the sound of the purple trinity seems to have also struck quite a chord with whose seems largely derivative of the material that joker gemmy and guido have issued over the past couple of years the soft bed of synths that open up the track seem a lot more rich and delicately programmed than any of the trios style but by the time the meaty halfstep drums and bassline open out were firmly in joker territory with a few zomby esque wibbles and wobbles offsetting the purple pitch shifts its an accomplished effort from the relative newcomer and one that should largely satisfy fans of the aforementioned producers but you get the feeling that hell need to find his own sound to eventually stand out from the dubstep pack
anthropologist marc aug calls hotels and airports non-places where people are always and never at home as a touring dj roman fl gel probably spends as much time in non-places as clubs or his studio frankfurt-based artist has said that his third album for dial is very much a product of those surroundings in particular its about the solitary time in hotel rooms between gigs and that strange mixture of peace and isolation fl gel isnt the first musician to explore these non-spaces his debt to brian enos music for airports is plain from the first pensive note of one of three ambient piano pieces this also isnt the first time the producer who is probably still most famous for the screeching techno of gehts noch has explored such reflective moods a disquieting undertow made the title of 2014s happiness is happening feel ambiguous title of this years verschiebung ep can be translated as displacement which perfectly describes the bittersweet sense of transience in save for the sprightly these tracks have more in common with verschiebung s abstract structures than the burnished contours of fl gels earlier work or recent records like monday brain here beats convey disorientation more than dynamism both and seem to have rhythms running at different speeds the effect is like wandering jetlagged through a busy and unfamiliar city whereas the melodies in an old tune like how spread lies would fill the mix on tracks like theyre distant and fleeting if some of feels unfocused as fl gel cuts loose from his usual structures that feeling of dislocation is probably part of the point album reaches its peak with the final three tracks both introspective and expansive the title tracks guitar soars and dissipates like a contrail over a bustling beat before shows up to shake and disintegrate shifting balance between drone and piano makes move subtly between the ominous and optimistic closing the record on a note of emotional uncertainty but whats completely clear about is that its a highly personal album in his exploration of them fl gel makes these non-spaces his own
californias is a newcomer to the crew; is his debut single to be followed by night in the woods in october oth releases take the label as far into technos outer reaches as it has traveled yet i exchanged some mails with friedman last fall when he was shopping demos around; he told me he was inspired by ricardo villalobos interest in stretching and shifting club musics timekeeping without entirely breaking from the most obvious tropes of the genre not only has he nailed that difficult task hes done it with more elegance and surprise than villalobos himself has brought to many of his recent releases certainly shows the minimal maestros influence in its soft rounded percussion which rolls like pebbles at the bottom of a stream; it also shares some of shackletons ethno preoccupations with leathery hand drums and crackling underbrush the nine-and-a-half minute track develops according to its own logic beginning with tentative plinking rhythms before getting swept up in squalls of pitch-bent synthesizer lead and shimmering feedback reminiscent of seefeels succour / lter take a slightly more floor-focused view on the -side honing in on a restless funk bassline and melting siren top line and drawing it out for 11 minutes of sensual slightly unhinged meandering destination unknown and unimportant
the next man behind s third installment in the mix series comes from no other then one of the leading lights of the label himself not only has chris released a number of very solid productions on the label such as dub sonar and atmospheric graffiti but he has been very busy in the remix department too with reworks for the likes of main element and the flash brothers this time he is asked to mix and he does a pretty damn good job showcasing what is all about the first disc really waste any time in getting into the thick of things with some very solid offerings early on namely with solid remixes early by the likes of chris micali and grayarea original offerings by chimera and yunus guvenen also set the early pace in this mix and the feel early on is quite smooth with a very nice melodic aura luke chable s very nice remix of s dub sonar is nicely edited with a breakbeat drum pattern giving the track a different slant to what we have heard syndrome by ben camp turns the heat up a little and introduces a sizzling baseline shortly before salt s very own epic remix of ways by flash brothers looks set to start a solid ending to this first disc aidan lavelle delivers a peak time remix of his own and introduces a delicious ending to the mix by benz md in dead calm and what is overall quite a summer like mix disc two definitely takes off where the first disc left andres xavier impress early with a driving effort in floating with you and ben camp returns again with some crisp beats and sinister baselines in new world which is a great highlight in the album i must say the absolutely brilliant orchid remix of rainbows in the sky by the hypnotist thankfully is included and it drives the mix along much like s very own remix of synergy s hello strings it s followed by another one of chris remix this time his fantastic reworking of delta of venus by main elements and it marks the peak time moments of this second disc carrier by david west continues the driving nature of the disc while chimera delivers an absolute stunning breakbeat moment with natural high the deep baselines and twirling melodies of still rain by benz md close up what is a very pleasing album a very solid outing here by and this showcase really does indicate why have constantly been a label at the forefront of progressive music it s quite delightfully mixed but most importantly it is full of really stunning productions full of melody
uk duo blackhall bookless are residents at londons jaunt party a club night that books names like nina kraviz shonky and steffi i dare say theyre better known as djs than producers at this point but that looks set to change with their debut ep on vitalik their sound fits their party: accessible tech house sculpted with one ear to the ground and the other pointed in the direction of stargazing melody with esoj s decorous chords its almost no surprise to hear the glistening synth orchestra that emerges halfway through the baroque is kept in check by a lazily lapping rhythm which german duo hatikvah contort into a jazzy swing pinning down the tracks glacial overtures into filtered waves and dressing the whole thing up with gently tickled ivories soulades remix is decidedly simpler throwing a hip-hop bump beneath the proceedings (and some rather cliched drum machine sounds) without losing sight of what made it so pretty in the first place the ep is rounded off with which with its sturdy backbone and synth flourishes recalls recent uk gloss house underlined with an eerie almost funereal bassline

fabio monesi aka hissman goes further than most to keep his tracks true to the original chicago-rooted form of house music much of the music released on his two labels and wilson records is purely analog monesi uses an akai mpc2500 to sequence his productions and records directly onto reel-to-reel tape a small cult of like-minded producers such as steve murphy and jay green release on monesis labels as well as obvious forbears gene hunt and jordan fields as of late monesi has developed a taste for anonymous projects three recent wilson records 12-inches are credited to no artist and the label has said they dont know much about the producer behind untilted whoever is he or she has crafted a memorable banger in the untitled the tune starts with a menacing acid line and an incessant cowbell that recalls classic detroit electro a wild synth lead threatens to send things off the rails before a sample of an impassioned vocalist starts yelling im gon feel like a similar formula falls short on the b1 the ham-fisted juxtaposition of a busy acid line and a black man howling lord have mercy feels jarring and uncomfortable the a2 is a welcome respite from the jacking lo-fi onslaught homing in on a meditative pad the b2 is hampered by a dodgy mix-down most evident in a hi-hat that overpowers things s highs and lows can be seen as a bi-product of hardmoons dogmatic no computers stance monesi and co flip the machines on get a gnarly jam going record it and force themselves to leave well-enough alone theres something to be said for keeping house music this simple and unfussy

the 2nd release on comes from and his it is also armed with a remix from the very talented habersham the original mix begins quite nicely with some crisp beats and a devastatingly large bassline the track flows nicely with some intricate melodies and warm pads that intensify as the track progresses all while the smooth and funky basslines give the track a great drive and the high end sounds the melodies some pretty sweet uplifting broken beats here habersham s mad haberish remix has a good drive from the word go with some pretty strong kick drums soon enough a subtle melodic pattern that has been given the habersham twisted treatment soon enter the track and the flow from here on is seductive there is a slight eeriness to it all but you cannot take your attention away as it is habersham at his very best it s a quality remix that really adds value to this pretty strong release

and cocoon seems obvious no purveyor of big room techno meets purveyors of big room techno oth are much more than that simple description ut at their core the goal is very much the same: make people happy on this split 12 inch the irish born producer strives for that using big trancey chords a muscular rhythm and a thick bassline that cuts through everything to become the star attraction no fuss no filler does exactly what it says on the tin and are less obvious cocoon men but their collaboration on the flip is no less effective the tune bounces in the same way that kufen once did on force inc and uses the same sort of micro samples as glorious punctuation periods exclamation points question marks theyre all in play here as the duo seems to take pleasure in adding a different blast of noise every few moments its not atonal by any means and by tracks end it all makes complete sense ut as it develops you may find yourself wondering whats coming up next there are worse things to be afraid of
rriving in the least ubiquitous fashion possible and delivered with a little mystery thrown in for good measure is the latest 10-inch slice of garage-flecked detroit techno-suckling dubstep from the facially ambiguous producer christening his productions with numerical monikers such as or may seem like another way to alienate anyone who isnt searching specifically for his work but by not naming them after lost loves or some other nonsense your left with one thing to judge: the music with these two distinctly different cuts positively shines deeply throbbing away the introduction bars of before he rolls out a garage drum pattern swirling house chords and then quick-paced wobble bass into the speakers as the chords dissipate rranging the bass in such a way ensures that your ear hangs on for each occurrence as its mid-range sounds delectable over the top of the echoing vocal stabs and high-passed prog synth swells rides a more dub template with the off beat piano framing things in a more half-time swagger from the off as the kick drums become a constant fixture snatches of female vocals morph into piano stabs that fade up until they sound out loud on each beat of the bar before they descend back down into some hyper delayed 2562-esque chords proving in a single manoeuvre that knows exactly how to transform and meld his synths perfectly
you could call it passing the jiggle horizon : that moment of the night when the warm-up gets a little bit hotter when the early dancers put their drinks down and their arms up when the dj knows theyve got the crowds attention usually its the subtle builders that get us there ernest st laurents clumsy lobster would be a longtime personal fave; more recently anthony naples mad disrespect has done the trick s second album provides eight new tunes that aim for and often achieve the very same effect while shepheards debut album home and garden offered a soundtrack to afterparty sofa sessions goes for the other end of the night the uk-born berlin-based dj has road-tested these tracks over the past year and it shows: the vibrating basslines of and feel like a ripple moving through a club tracks like damore and boast the rolling 4/4 funk that parties like secretsundaze love is good enough to be a new metro area track and the piano riff on sounds very early 90s (and thus also very now) and while shepheard might have turned the tempo up uses the same sort of structures and sounds we heard on home and garden with languid melodies and murmuring vocals blurring into an understated breakdown that recalls deep dish circa 1998s junk science theyre all safe bets for the dance floor which also means they steer clear of any risks shepheard has said he wants to be a collection of go-to club tracks consider that mission accomplished that are simultaneously working together as a whole he hasnt quite pulled off that last part simply because theres not that much difference in style or a sense of progression here you can easily listen to any of these tracks in isolation or the whole thing on shuffle without losing too much but what youll really miss at home is the atmosphere of a primed dance floor that shepheard so convincingly conjures up a place where makes you desperately want to go
this release features three truly sound mixes of absolutely solid uplifting trance track s was originally put together for the japan world cup with loads of interest from the uk and us and with lots more on the way this track is due for a huge success the first track on this release is the kenny hayes radio edit of by it is an instantly uplifting track most recognisable and sticking in your mind in moments the superb electro sounding vocal takes you away it features loads of uplifting synth s put together nicely with a great punchy bassline ensuring it puts a big smile on the face of punters next in line for this 3 track release is the ibiza mix by mister hayes it features a little bit more of a housey edge yet still manages to keep its trance sound this is an exceptional mix really drawing out what makes this track so solid and putting it more into a club sound this thing would drive any up-for-it dance-floor nuts and finally the friction mix the start of the friction mix reminds me of yomanda s synth and strings track form years back but the true colours of this remix quickly show the remix has an early massive breakdown and then continues to build before peaking with some quality tweaks to the original that really set this up their this is the sort of mix that you would expect many of the top trance djs to spin it s easy to see why it has loads of playtime from armin van buuren and dave slade definitely my pick of the bunch
s 1988 pop hit dont worry be happy is guaranteed to bring back memories for listeners of a certain age his son taylors debut album for is unlikely to have the same effect but it is in its own oblique way a curiously nostalgic record recalls 70s lps by the likes of herbie hancock with whom sr collaborated and actually evokes the process of remembering insomuch as its full of teasing hints and hazy feelings that ebb and flow throughout that sensation seems to reflect the way the brooklyn-based producer constructed the record pieced together from scraps of demos hed left unfinished some cases such as am and they remain short bits of ideas album title gives a good indication of its drowsy feel one familiar from other records such as teebs recent e s t r or more chilled moments from label boss flying lotus some tracks slowly reveal themselves like dawn spreading across the skyline begins with languid keys and murmuring i want to love you / in such a special way before rising aloft on whorls of synth re has the effect of a camera zooming further and further out focusing first on the skittish drumbeat before rippling keys and a centipede bassline expand the frame until you feel like youre floating far above it and are the records two most famous guests label-mate s ragged yet childish voice sounds close to joanna newsom on the forlorn shows taylor is a consummate songwriter as well as a beatmaker with s beautiful voice swimming in soft electronic currents and submerged sub-bass s dad makes an appearance on visible / visible scatting and whistling to himself like a man lost in a daydream like all of this tune seems content to meander along at its own pace going nowhere fast and savouring every moment
country makes it hard to fuck karin dreijer bellows on one of the more startling songs in her catalogue no definitions in our own needs she sings perverts define my fuck history thats just one of many defiantly queer moments on an album that uses sexuality and self-determination as a weapon against the oppression of normalcy were not attractive to this countrys standards she practically spits on dreijer internalizes the anarcho-feminist themes of knifes shaking habitual and channels its rebellion against patriarchal society into something personal album burns its way through its 47 minutes with a determination and focus weve scarcely heard from dreijer before dreijer undergoes a sexual awakening on and at some points sounds like an alien learning about love and lust for the first time shes wide-eyed at what she discovers and what she discovers she likes lyrics are more explicit than usual dreijer declares that i want to run my fingers up your pussy on the otherwise radio-friendly single nd whose video presents its protagonist as the willing sub at a bdsm tea party she embraces and then questions wanting to feel dirty on a blend of shame and excitement that should be familiar to anyone whos ever dared to venture beyond the norms of sexuality is just as bold in its production dreijer reunites with peder mannerfelt who contributed to the first album and whose fingerprints are visible on some of the records more techno-influenced moments but mannerfelt mostly works behind the scenes to reinforce dreijers synth leads and rhythmic tics nd where those squiggly melodies and bouncing drums once sounded alien here the pitch-bending and undulating melodies feel like an expression of the albums human themes re are some stylistic diversions from the usual dreijer sounds a song with lyrics like blood was our favourite paint / were my favourite pain has a beautiful violin solo by sara parkman and surprisingly delicate production from paula temple (who appears three times on ) nd theres bout a 160 bpm heart palpitation of a song produced by nid a song expresses the extremes of curiosity eagerness and reticence you might experience with online dating if the feelings on past records could seem impenetrable or odd the emotional chaos on is much more representative of the real spectrum of human feeling when theres no clean line between love and disappointment lust and hatred mania and loneliness it used to bother me that violence is as intimate as love dreijer writes in a note on the website but i see that you have resolved that problem by dissolving the two into each other on sex is violence and violence is sex just like the sensual bloody imagery that accompanied the albums rollout se themes of queerness and sexuality make feel remarkably current y echo those of artists like rca sophie and rabit producers who express their queerness by altering and transforming sounds into unnatural and sometimes queasy shapes but it never feels like dreijer is playing catch-up is the natural next step a realization of impulses that have long lain dormant or at least unrecognized maybe dreijer was waiting for the rest of the world to catch up to her
kel mckeowns most recent lp fourth: the golden eagle was like an ode to analogue synthesisers as it bubbled between wonky hip-hop and brightly hued house it was almost possible to see his hands dancing over the keys and feel the sense of performance over programming for his debut on semteks dont be afraid mckeown again lets his instruments run wild though verit is more floor-focused than much of his other work its still crammed with contrasting ideas an absent kick on the second beat creates a rhythmic hole where arpeggiated basses and pads swirl or heavily filtered echo trails bubble like the breath of a cartoon fish elements build and fade occasionally coming to a complete halt before a new movement kicks in; the pieces hang over from the previous section creating an odd sense of discord former transmat sound engineer kevin keeps most of the original the missing kick moves to the fourth beat the arpeggios whir gently around fizzing hats but he cuts through it all with an acid line that could dissolve glass dismembers mckeowns charming original with surgical precision
disco edits are trending downward at the moment a bit of relief as reworks had been getting lazier and lazier when theyre not outright boots ut much as he did before disco experienced a revival a few years ago rub n tug/still goings eric duncan k dr dunks marches on a cottage industry unto himself s if the c o m i imprint werent enough dunkss has commenced a new edit label the -side lends the new series its name a funky incessant stomper with a chopped vocal uttering lights all around me and bring us together making it a no-brainer for peak time ut its the b-side that will have tongues wagging first heard during dj harveys eats in space appearance in january dunks dug deep into the 80s countrypolitan cheapy bin to come away with a sultry edit ing the honky-tonk dark slink and rhinestone clacks of the original track he re-jiggers the woozy guitar solo and cuts away the nasally chorus s a fairly simple way to make an edit true yet in never allowing release to come ps revels in its potential
bpitch control boss has always managed to give techno a melodic joyful and innocent feel be it fragmented and delicate vocals on her album berlinette or the fusion of rough beats and pparats strings on last years awesome orchestra of bubbles she has a gift for making music that not only rocks but has a unique warmness to it thankfully shes managed to maintain the same aural aesthetic on this excellent mix for fabric and has produced one of the best in the series general trajectory of the mix is more upbeat at the start with a monged out middle and dreamy end opening of ( t believe the chord pop hype) by brings things in perfectly with its haphazard crescendo of clicks which last more than three minutes before finally giving way to a beat brilliant by then continues to build things thanks to a lush delayed organ refrain and infectious dubbed out nineties house beats is by rtificial could have come straight off orchestra of bubbles and in the absence of any new oob material it makes a very welcome stopgap monged out middle comes with s for lter ego fans (of which is one half) this wont be what youd expect but bearing in mind his technical ability trust me when i say that he makes what appears to be a xylophone being played in water over a skippy beat work well electronic music doesnt get much dreamier than pparat so its fitting the mix ends with one of his tracks rcadia from his new album walls one thing thats always interesting on mixes is how many of their own tracks an artist puts on them only includes one of her own offerings a wedging it between orkes and s not exactly an obvious trio oure left with the impression shes doing it for the music and because it sounds good not to shift units of her own music which is how it should be lthough is only halfway gone id venture that if you get this and optimos walkabout youll be hard pressed to find a better pair of electronic mix cds this year

there was a telling interview with dave huismans (2562 / ) in f ct magazine last year where dutch producer explained that music doesnt really need context whe r thats a genre or a music scene or personal life of author to be relevant hes right: no form of art or expression needs context to exist but it helps nd often its far more important for music to be emotive shocking representative of a particular time or place or just downright cool than it is for it to be well-made i think this is where my issue with a lot of huismans music comes in i own more records by guy than i do 90 of his contemporaries but once yve been shelved y rarely come back out his production is consistently impeccable with every little element in its own perfect space but its lacking something memorable and constantly betrays fuck context approach he by his own admission takes while making music is different its prepared to take odd risk for one and has a sense of timing that makes it stand out from that middle ground between dubstep and techno that becomes more greyscale by day t its centre are some heavily (and i mean heavily) panned synths and when y drop full force rest of track mostly made up of rattling factory line drums completely gives way before snapping straight back into place on flip nger looks back to huismans broken beat days with bruked out overdriven drums that are more than a little reminiscent of ltered natives and a similarly clanging assembly line aes tic to its far less remarkable than this singles title track it is b-side after all but overall it helps to make up most memorable release to date
volume one and two set a specific tone for the series: sepulchral monochrome sounds from the samurai horo and auxiliary labels with nothing but music to focus on the tracks so far have further ironed out the plane connecting dubstep drum bass and techno something samurai music and its affiliates have long worked towards volume three is striking for the atmospheres that shroud its fluctuating beats on a chilly breeze holds the dismantled drum bass pieces in a stasis the backdrop of is steeped in hiss making it all the murkier and seems to emanate from some dark dank cavern is the only exception heavy staccato rhythms grapple for your attention from the start sounding like a motorbike sputtering into gear as it expels toxic fumes chainmail shakes and bleary bell hits add to the sonic pollution as the track swells in dirty guffs trying to guess exactly who produced volume three sort of misses the point but as comparisons go enas most recent red seal offering lands the closest
