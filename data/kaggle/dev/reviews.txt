after morrissey s contribution to this new series from dmc it s time for to go after being a major part of one of the bands of the 90 s in stone roses this mix is very similar to a back to mine in that it is a snapshot of what tastes in music are all about not necessarily a mix cd it s more a gathering of different styles of music from hip hop to soul the first track in particular is a highlight by gza and genius in liquid swords the first half of the cd then moves into a period of reggae inspired music where fade away by junior byles acts as a particular highlight with its deep dubby baselines fug by cymande acts as a transition to more funk styles until the cd includes a bit of rock with lover by the de-lites the compilation definitely has variety and diversity on its side and unless you really have a varied taste in music then not all of the selection may appeal to you if reggae soul and funk sound good to you on one cd then this may be your thing
on the eve of their debut lp (gavin russom and viva ruiz) strip down the album cut a gooey psychedelic fro-latin number soaked in organs and his/her vocals to the bare essentials with a lot of this kind of deeply analog do-or-die live-in-the-studio stuff its one idea beaten over and over not necessarily a bad thing mind if that one idea is strong enough ut russom has a way of cutting up long hypnotic jams into passages that dont seem to have anything to do with each other and without losing any sense of continuity underpinning the nearly nine-minute-long is a single monotonic bassline not even a line just one note threaded through a bumptious 707 drum pattern; the foundation doesnt change much but the floor plan has all the twists and turns of the winchester mystery there are hissed and muttered glossolalic outbursts lcd soundsystem yelps and weirdly panned cooing choruses; the organs feel like theyve been thrown at the wall like big chunks of meat and left to slide down in bloody streaks the dub mix puts the emphasis back on the bass and organ interplay with the vocals (mostly) erased and the muted drums as cool and damp as a dewy lawn at six in the morning
the temperature drops a few degrees the moment you put on an track and his third release is no different his style is meticulous and has a steely sheen hes a master of technicalities an ep like saudade is so effective because of its intelligent design composure and all-round sleekness not that his techno is over-buffed or bookish you can totally freak out to it is a typical head trip: squirrelly and refined without a hair out of place is just shy of sounding like a paranoia-induced meltdown but keeps any rash displays pegged down tight a few mordant bubbles escape in a rush to the surface but thats it mostly the tracks make an adroit use of dynamics and tension which are in effect on the stealthy albeit in a more muted way might be s most hallucinogenic effort yet he doesnt loosen his grip but keeps the momentum as rigorous as ever allowing the details to do the subversive work
release number 3 from bristol based comes from german producer whos produced tunes for major labels such as sony universal and bmg as well as smaller labels like germanys dangerous drums and his own viperjive imprint is a dark slab of breaks infused with hip hop garage and drumnbass influences with october providing a remix side v is a electro-infused number featuring a razor sharp hook deep growling bass and a hip hop vocal which gives rise to the name as the tune progresses it incorporates more techy stabs effects and wobbles a build up on the bass and a few cleverly placed drum fills (a bit plump sounding too ) towards the end the tune kills the bass and drops into a percussive breakdown its built for a dark peaktime floor however it tends to get a bit riffy side s (october remix) vs signee october takes the tune and provides a much darker (even darker than it already is) remix incorporating a booming bassline (similar to tipper and fuel records in some sense) a new variation on the razor like hook hard hitting pads and a percussive breaks lick laced on top giving the tune an underground grimy feel
howard ernstein widely known as is a bit of a veteran he has done it all with a lot of success he has been prominent in the music industry since the early 80 s but it wasn t really until the early 90 s that became the big name that he is today working with artists such as goldie massive attack as well as co producing u2 s pop album which included an invitation to produce the live sound for its accompanying world tour not an achievement many can lay claim to despite this huge success story in the production field still tears the dancefloors apart when behind the decks this abriclive mix indicates nothing less mix starts in a quirky manner with the electro ridden by s on the other hand is a total different class breathtaking drum patterns with an exotic melody splattered with accapella which leads smoothly into the pmt mix of the same tune many should be familiar with medicine s robot induced remix of in by s trademark sound is ever present with his remix of by eautiful by is as it name suggests a beautiful fusion of breakbeat and tribal instincts the should have you hopping around with its bouncing baseline while take you eyond the early 90 s and straight into the 80 s ar provides the finale to the mix with oundation a slow reggae inspired record to slow it down to a halt this is a brilliant mix and in my opinion definitely one of the better abric releases which is a compliment in itself variety all blended masterfully has commented how difficult it was to do this mix but the results indicate that he put all his time and effort into this mix for you to simply sit back put the feet up and enjoy
the most surprising thing about s records has been their concision given each of the trios live performers has their own arsenal of modular gear it must be tempting to overstuff things but apparently last years eps for art records and brokntoys didnt go far enough on this followup for the group pare things back further the resultant electro tracks are impressively well sculpted but their subtle melodies and laser-precise drums sometimes lack distinguishing features in the eps first half simple details give the music the right smudge of colour on its a think break which lends bite to an otherwise clinical sound palette (the trio used breakbeats equally well on last years pusher ) on its a shifting melodic element which adds dynamism to a glistening battery of hi-hats and incidental percussion the other half of the ep struggles to maintain this balance s palpitating low-end isnt enough to hold attention the track feels half-empty until a sparse bassline enters in the latter half but its mixed timidly low the idm-ish is the eps most rhythmically inventive track its moods glowering menace at the opening dark melancholy later are expressed cautiously but the whole thing never quite finds its feet
a one sided 12 of the original of love is ok and odd quirky minimal techno operatic vocals hover over minimal dark drums and a haunting 3 note bassline the vocals are chopped up slowed down and repeated to form an interesting and original method of production angry twisted male speech appears later to form a contrast between warmth and sinisterness you don t hear stuff as unique as this too often these days and it s worth your hard earned dosh for that alone
produces house music where propulsive rhythms are married with raw grimy textures to often intriguing effect where his pma 12-inch on l i e s was more in keeping with that labels dusty aesthetic than his apron ep on his second release for funkinevens label beato strikes a fine balance between squelch and grit ep opens with a beatless track thats all synthesised strings and submerged vocal sample whos the in charge ovaa here is the eps highlight beginning with a bruising kick drum to which beato adds a new sound every couple of bars it remains spacious and vibrant even as it expands to incorporate a sticky bassline dreamy pads open hi-hats and rubbery synth lines snares and claps on dreamin are mucky but theyre offset by battering-ram kicks and belatedly a velvety bassline and jubilant chords brilliantly titled worship se is similarly sparse opening with echoing drum hits and a chirpy synth that makes way for abrasive pads and a sputtering groove beato reprises the submerged vocal sample of for satans a beatless coda whose centrepiece is an urgent sawing synth
not much is yet known about the label but thatll probably end soon the young swedish imprints debut 12-inch ticks all the right boxes: dance floor-friendly just weird enough to stand out and an anonymous producer at the helm whats not to like especially considering the music: somehow effortlessly merges dub techno and loopy mannheim house into a coherent package dropping a repeated vocal sample directly into an upbeat cloud of smoky 4/4 beats theres a reason its been charted by the likes of headfuck techno man samuli kemppi remote rea compatriot oris werner echocord boss kenneth christiansen tresor resident suzi wong and slow motion house man cottam isnt quite a crossover gem like the flip the way it reworks dub techno fundamentals however is equally as engaging jettisoning the vocal sample for a melody that seems to be built from someone quickly waving their hand in front of an air vent theres no lack of fascinating sounds on offer theres a bit less grooviness s raw beat hits and hits again with little variation criticizing its lack of swing though only serves to highlight the quality on hand is clearly a label to keep an eye on

recently complained to ra that techno [right] now is really fucking clean and its not really like its played in a warehouse a great quote but the berlin-based british producers debut album is a stronger statement of intent throws away the traditional techno toolkit rejecting generic drum sounds like snares and kicks and refusing synthesisers altogether it relies instead on field recordings of suitably metallic sounds underground trains rolling over tracks crunched-up foil treated beyond recognition the results are a distorted hybrid of the pummelling schranz of tommys label manager chris liebing and the blank minimalism of richie hawtins plastikman output while undeniably techno in its tempo and structure s abrasive aesthetic owes more to the 90s pioneers who dragged industrial metal onto the dance floor though unique in their origins the crackling percussion and short-circuited saws bear a stark resemblance to those used by say former nine inch nails member and remixer charlie clouser with end track an uptempo take on aphex twins own reznor refix at the heart of it all aware that all that distortion and the industrial size of the sounds can be overwhelming uses vocals to introduce a human element and a bit more soul he enlisted fellow expat sound designer emika whose hushed abstracted voice adds much-needed melody to g and its reprise tracks that poke their heads above the albums sea of noise gasping for air s neo-industrialism is a first step towards taking techno back to juan atkins original intention: music that sounds like technology it may be less conceptually neat than emikas own work on the ostgut ton f nf compilation (which used sounds recorded in berghain) but presents a singular uncompromising vision where listeners once heard the rusted machinery of a dying detroit between its beats techno today echoes the hollowed-out industrial spaces of berlin and the trains that take clubbers there isnt an easy listen but at least it contains the right sounds
has left quite a trail in a short time she hit the ground running mid 2009 with love dub on hyperdub an instant ear grabber especially for fans of the aquatic mid 90s jungle that served as a clear muse like a lot of producers lately male and female alike she sings (nicely with a touch of melancholy but more sweet than not) and on she pipes in a spare lyric: i know dis boy from round the way sounding most effective in ghostly isolation it makes things nicely ambiguous in s remix the tension plays out so that the track feels like a song even though it isnt structured much like one at all it calls up the specials and tricky as much as it does s hyperdub leaning peers s two tracks are peppier and make for a fetching contrast l vis s remix of is built on samples of running water papery hand drums and breaking glass beyond (obviously) the bass drops and layered percussion its a vivid mix of wet and dry (literally in a way) and grows more bass intensive as it goes but not more show offy is the wobbler; it could have been titled stuck inside of centipede with the space invaders blues gain
since 2006 some of germanys finest minimal house has been released on a boutique label called run by and even tuell the imprint is a modest but impressive operation with only six releases to date theyve pressed untitled tracks by the likes of move d sascha dive benjamin brunn and kassem mosse takes the helm on delivering three austere slow jams that make for one of the labels best installments yet the best track is the monolithic -side t 112 bpm it drifts along for a solid two minutes with little more than elliptical diva chrips and dubby warbles when the bass finally drops the track locks into a pumping groove its a lengthy jaunt but a lot happens over the course of its 11 minutes at the halfway mark the drums get a bit more syncopated and twinkling arpeggios draw up a spacey atmosphere cooling down the aggressive march of the tracks first half once you hear it this one is impossible to leave out of a low-tempo set the other two tracks achieve something entirely different restrained subtle grooves the first b-side track is laidback and almost lazy sounding with extra subdued drums and a choppy bass melody stirring up an understated groove it has a soft organic feel like something from soulphictions do you overstand the second b-side has the same careful rhythm and recalls some of the reverb-laden keyboards from the end of the -side its the least remarkable track on the ep but its restrained tone of suspense could make it an interesting dj tool the thudding -side is what really makes this record outstanding but all three are produced with a subtle craftsmanship that keeps them fresh for dozens of spins bring on 007
is the latest signing to a bristol label with one release so far under its belt control / consumption the excellent debut from systems of desire k kowton and hyetal s debut release is a pair of unashamedly retro hardware jams bundled with a funkineven remix finds a sweet spot between detroit techno and late- 0s boogie though its ripples of bright synth make the solid techno groove wonderfully tactile the vocal sample is too obvious and doesnt add much more machine funk than techno is better its cosmic synth lines and drum machine beats seem indebted to boogie and funk revivalist d m-funk though that doesnt necessarily detract from s knack for a great tune its hard to escape the feeling of familiarity funkinevens consummate skill is always welcome and he strips back to reveal its bare bones replacing the cosmic synths with a tougher loop that along with aggressive snares give the track a new urgency
parisian label has made late-night music its specialty new yorks joey anderson and workshop co-founder even tuell each released some of their prettiest and most introspective material on the label producing exquisite moments of dance floor bliss for closing-set djs with an adventurous streak is a nice addition to this crew: he too is a house music eccentric who favours unusual states of mind but even in this company his take on the raveyard shift is wonderfully weird and are both foggy low-slung rhythm workouts their grooves so slow and erratic that youd be forgiven for missing them entirely both work with a handful of samples slicing and retriggering in classic style the a-side with its dissonant guitar clusters and background distortion is probably the stronger of the two but both have a hypnotic quality that rewards deep listening preferably through a fog of exhaustion and alcohol closing the b-side blows out some of the cobwebs with arrhythmic synth blasts and the odd squeal of feedback has been bolder elsewhere but as a window into his strange universe is as good as any
many people are globally familiar with much of oslo electronic scene yet still somehow flies under radar the imprint run by a group of local djs and led by mung of mungolian jetset and yvind morken has released material from artists such as lindstr m lackbelt ndersen hardway ros and rune lindb k on this outing though its turn of ost kjex with ir rendition of princes tale of young desire the pop cover is a tried-and-true creative resource but norwegian disco producers seem to like it more than your average electronic knob twiddler todd terje mungolian and prince thomas have covered everything from wham to ob marley and this particular release sees duo similarly using form to experiment a bit and trade in deeper sounds found on ir recent diynamic releases for moroder-esque synth lines the arpeggiated melodies intertwine with each o r over a fast tech house beat and are surrounded with signature spacious sound that oslo and have become synonymous with vocals-wise though is where things get special as se two norwegian men in ir 30s turn tale of teen lust into a twisted story of two older men longing for teenage love sung in falsetto in same far-out fashion as jamie jones summertime only adds to bizarre quality of tune for those who cant take ost kjex vocal experience however yve graciously provided a dub version on flip which showcases just how much work and production is going on er underneath
a: sound of today after a massive entry into the breaks world have brought another fresh sounding downbeat number from renound producer - fink sound of today is a jazzy excursion into downtempo breaks at 135bpm i like to call it sex on wax the ultimate 6am tune programming with dreamy pianos and sexy saxaphones you truely need to witness this for yourself if youre a fan of fink then check this out aa: keeping the downbeat flavours throughout i dont know why is lighter on percussion but creates a mood to dim the lights and slide right on into more sax synths and pianos allow fink to take your mind and soul on a trip again music loves need only apply here
sounds like some heavy stuff doesnt it somehow it isnt londoner-via-paris succeeds on his debut by avoiding both the scratchy collagist aesthetic of crate-diggers like onra and the submerged quashed quality of most footwork for high-intensity percussive music that doesnt sound a whole lot like anything else out there opener spirations of a prisoner opens with cinematic strings and hollow rimshots no bass to be found anywhere before brings in tiny little clips of orchestral mayhem that serve as an ominously throbbing bassline features more traditionally frenetic footwork rhythms a flurry of cascading hollow drums and decaying synths but even this incorporation of familiar structures sounds totally unique other two tracks are much slower abandoning the footwork mission for their own skewed takes on bass music 88 bpm a is a sticky-slow hip-hop jam with a funk guitar more languid than lashing but the ep peaks with the 122 bpm frica) splaying a house-friendly flute panned to the extreme peripheries of the stereo spectrum the undulating bass riff at its centre totally eclipses everything the kind of eminently physical frequencies that feel like theyre enclosing around your entire head rather than just your ears though the track might not technically be footwork it plays around with footworks dread-inducing dislocated bass clouds inflating them to a grotesque level ts an uncanny tune that remains breathtaking from the first play to the tenth and a little stroke of genius that raises above the level of just another producer jumping on the footwork bandwagon
s first new material since 2013s majestic amygdala reaffirms two distinct strands of his musical personality is gorgeous almost to the point of parody as if aiming to achieve extreme levels of bliss it kicks off by pairing a muted beat with gentle swells of shifting pads a womans pitched-down voice eventually recites a monologue about ecstasy her words set against backdrops of soft key patterns and various percussive flourishes of course weve heard koze in this headspace before wide-eyed pop ambient contributions like hummell and nymphe und sch fer spring to mind but might be the best example koze switches from bliss to his sparky irreverent mode discordant burring keys and fx are carried along by a typically generous percussive frame its radically different character further sharpens the joys of while also being hugely enjoyable on its own terms
next up on uk label is an exciting release from israeli producers their latest offering not only comes with a solid original mix from the brothers themselves but it once again showcases the promising talents of young producer chris salt on the a side is indeed the chris salt remix for me it is probably the most impressive mix of the two as it really encapsulates the atmosphere from the original more so then the original does it contains delicate break beat patterns as well as sizzling synth riffs combined with a seductive vocal snippet all combining to glide smoothly in unison for the most part of the track the original mix on the aa side contains the usual trademark influences of the with a solid drum pattern utilized as well as a smooth and eerie atmosphere the vocal line for me doesn t sit as well as it does in this mix compared to the salt mix however the looped snippets of the vocal line work quite well a very nice release from and a release that will see the labels young prodigy chris salt continue to raise his profile with quality remixes like the one featured here
even with labels like butterz and logan samas rejuvenated earth616 londons grime scene still feels a bit like a shambles maybe thats why one of the genres most exciting producers doesnt get much coverage well anywhere he should take its got the grubby basslines and synth horns that youd expect from any producer who cuts close to the traditional grime line but unlike the lovable chintziness of other producers s track is embellished with gut-wrenching bass and full-throated synths the title track takes a filtered sample and throws a jerky frenetic beat on top halfway between j sweet and joker the release is rounded off with two s: goes all the way with the horror movie motifs sweeping strings and ominous brass and takes a slinkier almost funky-esque slant with cool chords and jazzy accents theres an uncommon amount of space in s tracks an inversion of grimes usual pressure-cooker claustrophobia and it means that he sounds bigger and meaner than some of his contemporaries so while he might not be throwing in video game interpolations or electric guitar solos into his grime s latest shows that theres a whole lot of life and innovation left in the old style as well
terrence dixon is a busy man these days in addition to releasing a new album under his own name this year he revived his old alias for releases on harbour city sorrow and the newly minted chronicle imprint this time the detroit producers alter ego strikes on and atmospheric weirdness is mostly shelved in favour of a for-the-jugular attack thats not to say the strange quality of those previous eps is gone its just trampled by the sheer velocity of tunes that each reach close to 140 pm t this speed theyre almost all kick drum ratty broken drum that is kicking up dust and debris all around the occasional hi-hat that struggles to break through the wall of noise slippery keyboard melodies blanket the rest of the midrange like he cant quite get his fingers straight enough to play a proper melody s its title would suggest to is a refashioning of sorts this time an eerie string melody is thrown underneath the crunchy crackling kicks while the same lopsided melody bleats in the chaos like a beacon in a storm
reviewing edits without having the source material close at hand is tough business so if this write-up basically amounts to me saying to you that yes this exists youll have to excuse me it is worth pointing out that these s a s edits exist however for a variety of reasons first and foremost theyre a ton of fun second everybody and their brother seems to be playing them (so many in fact that the promo sheet calls these tracks hotter than a hilariously [ sic ed] preverbal potato ) third fourth and fifth theyre a ton of fun men behind the project are brummie producers subb-an and adam shelton and from what i can tell they do an exceptional job of cutting things up for the and the to make the as dance floor-friendly as possible where you hear their talent though is in the dub versions duo are bassline-obsessed adding a nice one to which fills in for the lost personality of the lovably out-of-key freestyle singer while s bassline also gets beefed up considerably subb-an and shelton dont have much time for the quirkiness of the originals if memory serves a ridiculous doctor metaphor was excised from but the dance floor doesnt lie: se things work like a charm

kevin martin has spent much of his career working with other people from justin k broadrick (as god ice techno nimal and the rest) to the wide range of reggae and grime vocalists that have helped shape his sound as bug n theres king midas sound his project with kiki hitomi and roger robinson whose last album edition 1 featured the experimental guitarist fennesz his collaborations while uncannily suited to his guests always sound intrinsically like his own work his new album with earth founder dylan carlson is another example of this rare skill recent earth albums 2011s darkness demons light i and 2012s darkness demons light ii give you get a sense of where has come from its not a grinding crush of intense drones as with the music from the ambient metal groups breakout years album is more meandering and spacious steered by minimal guitar riffs that are amplified into grand aural textures is a mammoth record but its more meditative than you might expect exceptions are and the albums main sonic assaults either of these on the right soundsystem will blow your face inside out were used to hearing voices and sensing multiple personalities in the music of bug but is a solitary record it was inspired by and recorded in los ngeles and fashioned from the sense of alienation martin has said hes felt when in the states like london zoo his first album for as bug is a response to a real environment but the album feels less specific to a given city it seems instead like a parallel space one that builds an impression of some future dystopia isnt without hope duo capture that feeling on which is as close to transcendence as gets is soothing too until a noisy swell washes in disturbing the tracks stoner guitar riffs glimmers of beauty emerge throughout the album even at its most ground down ( ) and aggravated ( ) thats the message we should take away from : that hope beauty and light can be found even in the darkest spots
one of the most popular and well-respected electronic dance acts to have endured over the years is without question nick warren and jody wisternoff aka way out west having broken onto the scene back in 1994 with the initial success of ajare they continued to gain momentum with such releases as domination and the gift the release of their self-titled debut album in 1997 received much critical and popular acclaim and established the name of way out west as one to watch in the future as can often be found the follow up album to the initial successful debut can always be a hard road to travel but for way out west it was one easy ride in 2000 their second album intensify was released and once again received critical acclaim and much fanfare the album spawned singles such as the addictive intensify and the much loved mindcircus for many the later is considered one of the standout releases for 2001 especially when gabriel dresden worked their magic on it and turned it into a track that was a success across a number of genres at that point in time you really couldn t get much better now in it was once again time to give the world another dose of the way out west sound in the form of their third album release don t look now without any question this current album cements them as one of the most talented bands that excel in portraying an aspect of electronic dance music as it should be heard the album opens with the progressive breaks of anything but you and the haunting tranquility of don t forget me tracks that are both enhanced by the vocals of wow s current vocalist omi while beautifully atmospheric in feel some may find these a little commercial in sound personally i don t care because to my ears they are simply a precursor of things to come things pick up grandly with the tangerine dream sampled everyday a track that grows on me with every listen it s definitely one of those progressive tracks that has a lot of substance and absolutely no fluff it s a funny thing but every time i hear apollo i m reminded of a veritable pandora s box the start is so misleading with its sublime progressive breaks and then it opens into a completely different track once there you re lost in a sea of melodic chords and riffs with subtle but important key changes this really is a 21st century version of what future generations will come to regard as modern classical music with chasing rainbows i m instantly reminded of an early morning tide on a deserted beach its calm beats are intoxicating and the guitar riff is used as a beautiful effect fear begins with a primal beat and then sweeps into a melody that is truly enhanced by the vocals of omi a definite big room number that would lay waste to any crowded dancefloor the majestic coming home is luxurious in feel and depth this track has a somewhat breakbeat feel but its more up tempo in sound to really appreciate this track you need to hear this on a crystal clear sound system because only then can you hear all of its nuances for me just like a man is modern day torch song there s an inherent sadness to this track which can be found in its down tempo beat the sweeping soundscape only adds to its atmospheric quality the opening of killa gently creeps up on you which lends a very dramatic beginning for what lies ahead it keeps growing in tension then dips and explodes into an aural beat infused treat this is probably one of the best wow tracks i ve ever heard it just takes you to another place in your mind because its quite grand in musical scale yet has a wonderfully dark feel in melody northern lights is another track that just grows in its beats and overall sounds its another track that while containing a progressive breakbeat feel it s much more melodic in texture and depth while melt is much the same way it s a track that is very different in sound with this track the vocals are used in a way that only enhance its overall tone if you can imagine swimming through a sea of the clearest blue water this is what it would sound like the breakdown during this track is almost as if you re coming up for air when we finally reach absinthe dreams its like hearing a modern adaptation of a trip hop classic druggy languid and addictive a fitting end to an artist album that is truly beautiful not only to hear but also to experience as an added incentive way out west have also included a bonus mix cd as a part of this release there aren t many artists that would do this and for that they have my respect my intention for this review was to focus on their artist release but i can t overlook the mix that came with this while i won t be giving it my typical analytical review what i will say is that it that the mix is very enjoyable to hear while not perfect the general sound is quite infectious it s definitely a mix in which i can hear influences from both jody wisternoff and nick warren two people who as individual djs i have the utmost admiration as is expected it s progressive in sound and won t disappoint those that love the genre if anything this bonus mix has a very ethereal quality and while there are quite a few highlights the track that stands out is blue room project s out of area remixed by up and coming stars habersham and numinous jeff belfi and shane ehlers as blue room project are a producing duo to look out for and i can t wait to see what the future holds for them this is only the beginning from an overall perspective way out west s don t look now is a pleasurable and sumptuous experience this is one release that smacks of maturity and a continually growing talent pool there is not one track that i can truly find fault with each track holds a wonderfully textured quality that grabs you from beginning to end more than anything if i close my eyes i can see various djs using each track in their set that s something that i don t often find my primary focus this year has been to listen to as many artist albums as possible and as such this is one of the standouts specifically it appeals to my persona more than any other this year whether it was progressive trance breaks house whatever quite simply it s about as close to perfection that i ve heard so far this year if anything it is a release that now makes me pant for the next way out west artist album music is the most personal thing anyone can experience from my perspective my life would be empty if i didn t have the ability to discover music such as way out west s don t look now as individuals we need to encounter everything there is to experience because without these moments we are never truly complete i yearn for the music i listen to much like i crave art and literature without these things that feed my senses my ignorance would be my downfall but with them i am complete and more importantly i feel for that i will always be thankful much respect tracklisting: 1 anything but you 2 don t forget me 3 everyday 4 apollo 5 chasing rainbows 6 fear 7

oni yhun aside ep is among the finest two-trackers ive heard all year full of imagination emotion and dance floor erudition it checks just about all the boxes that youd want from a 12-inch release this is nothing new for the lebanese-born rabih eaini whose excellent releases on his own morphine records imprint and m gt;o gt;s have flown mostly under the radar for the past few years ut while you can perhaps hear why previous efforts such as dark myths of phoenicia or cetrik might have had limited crossover appeal i dont think this is the case for maybe its just wishful thinking but s and its echoing and skronking saxophone darting in front behind and inside the hook strikes me as obvious fist-pumping material eainis work will no doubt be off-putting to some but he foregrounds the melody so much so that you can likely ignore the glorious mess behind it and simply focus on the percolating melody theres even less getting in the way of whose sputtering synth is buoyed by slithering droning chords oth tunes are obviously worked over as complex as your average modular synth soup but sounds effortless always a sign that something special has occurred
the main reason why berlin label tresor was such a dominant force in techno from the early 90s onwards is because it was the first imprint to provide a platform for emerging artists from both america and europe tresor focused as much on neil landstrumm and cristian vogel as it did on daniel bell and blake baxter and succeeded in uniting a wide range of sounds the labels legacy isnt lost on berlin dj/producer of the regular acts at the new tresor club over the past few years dehnert has been putting out a hard-edged take on techno on his fachwerk label thats inspired by tresors broad heritage is a dubby building club track thats reminiscent of vintage sender berlin or pacou albeit with modern production touches like the skipping beats and rattling percussion while iv goes for a harder route led by billowing chords and chainsaw percussive sounds similarly tough beats dominate on this time they underpin a grainy acid sequence thats similar to the new seldom felt but dehnerts coup de grace is howling analogue riffs are tweaked over a tough 303 rhythm as a male vocal mutters and groans menacingly it sounds like a sleazy blake baxter getting down to the sound of a classic vogel/landstrumm noise experiment and shows that tresors new generation is still jamming all the right boxes
the bodysnatchers is the new collective name for breakbeat producers 30hz baobinga whove collaborated previously on tunes like jack your body which was released on cyberfunk records and the highly successful know ya/all in your head on supercharged the bodysnatchers moniker represents the duos efforts when they take the sounds of electro and house and translate them into breaks side v rip shit up making no allowances for subtleties rip shit up kicks off with a heavy breakbeat and a throbbing low-end bassline and hip hop vocal samples which lend themselves to the title of the tune the beats are combined with trademark 30hz percussion and baobinga drum fills for those who are familiar with their know ya tune can hear similar synth stabs and this is just the intro once the main verse kicks in an even bigger bassline drops in giving the bassbins a run for their money towards the middle they introduce a big siren like noise which progressively builds to a climax its on a similar tip to know ya but on a much darker and sinister tone side s slam pig itd be interesting to know who 30hz and baobinga have been listening to lately as slam pig is their take on progressive trance and theyve hit the nail right on the head even the beats have a four to the floor outlook with a couple of off-beat kicks and punchy snares to make sure it stays in breakbeat territory a deep driving bassline kicks in after a long intro and takes on the style that can be heard from a progressive djs set slowly the pair incorporate various trancey hooks on top until the middle breakdown where they remove it all and slowly bring it all back again it seems like theyre trying to win new fans with this one fans of the hard house persuasion
the two tracks on this split 12 inch between veteran producer and newcomer complement each other rather well s is a frenetic electro cut with a fine contrast between scuzzy and slick textures grainy bassline and the kind of distorted vocal s always utilised so well are pitted against chrome plated percussion and smooth pads s has its share of oddness sax tones and bird sounds are thankfully uncommon in modern dance music but used here to accent the serpentine bassline and stark drum clatter they work the track pushes and pulls: around the middle the elements drop off to reveal just the percussive skeleton and that bird whistle before the bassline returns the groove is immersive but unstable so although s track initially seems more predictable it throws you just as much as s

given that s mo as both a club night and a label has been predicated on risk-taking and experimentation the frazzled house of s latest ep for the berlin label is notably accessible davison a london-based irishman has a love of classic soul and theo parrish and he combines these influences across three uplifting sun-dappled tracks the eps most forceful moment announces its arrival with thudding kicks slivers of looped vocals and generous dollops of sub-bass before scuttling off into the distance with clanking percussion davison cites daphni as inspiration but theres a hint of scubas big-room raucousness here the jaunty analogue space-funk of is a departure with its traces of french house and thievery corporation but is the winner here a blissful slab of twinkling mid-tempo house for its first three minutes it jolts you out of your reverie when davison detonates a charge of quaking bass underneath it
family is a big influence in dance music: often youll hear djs and producers name check their parents older siblings and other family members for helping expose them to the underground for the first time in the case of his first solo release is indebted to the man he helped give him his start nearly 20 years ago omar-s dj mix the duo made in 1992 was recently released on cd on fxhe it featured plenty of vocal house jams from that era that went on to become anthems but this release is planted firmly in todays underground deep house music the first cut nigga is a deep and abstract afterhours jam that uses subtle melodic touches to work its way into your psyche buckle up is a more uptempo dance floor track but still has the sensibilities of classic detroit house strick pays tribute to the west side of detroit with a track that originally appeared on a fxhe compilation on beatport its been a long wait to get it on wax but its worth it: its the highlight of the ep smooth synth flourishes reverberate over a bubbling bassline to create a classic somewhat more rough sounding mix of is the base for a sampled dialogue about growing up as a young black man on nd rounding out the ep is the lo-fi rumble of doe which is reminiscent of some of the grittier omar-s tracks ll in all a fine first release that will be a staple in the crates of the deep and nasty house-loving djs out there
anonymity is almost impossible these days it seems saw burial reveal himself basic channel and underground resistance became regular fixtures on the festival circuit and wolfgang voigts moves were covered on these pages almost daily the myspace generation clearly forcing all and sundry to come out of hiding fortunately not quite all: the shadowy have been beavering away in obscurity since 2001 releasing untitled tracks in text-free none-blacker vinyl-only editions no information available aside from gushing blurbs on the kompakt website ( totally exciting new techno from berlin drexcia-inspired genius druggy stuff ) in a culture currently collapsing from promotion-overload this information-void is particularly appealing and s clunky brand of techno only adds to the charm brazenly hand-crafted functional but with little interest in fads or genre conventions this is weird stuff it sounds like the product of berghain mated with profan: dark reverb-dunked rhythms lost in pools of tape hiss divergent patterns causing further confusion crudely sampled patches of static is marcel dettmann meets marcel marceau; punishing but with tongue-in-cheek and a playful glint in its eye if t raumschmiere is technos punk-rock then is its no wave the cd features 14 tracks most of them around five minutes in length which gives the tunes the feel of studies or experiments of the sort found on old sound library collections simple themes are quickly established then quickly discarded the opening track is a waltz a strauss lollipop loping in dank dubstep terrain until track 2 stomps in offering a beautifully hackneyed take on minus minimal the trademark claves and congas lazily daubed in charcoal loops of hiss bleed into ghostly warning tones in track 5 pseudo latin rhythms stumbling over clattering electro breaks while track 7 loses grand trance themes in thick fog pads and drums distorting bleeding into the surrounding mist the palate remains firmly monochromatic all dub techno greys draped over minimal drum patterns but the manner in which these buckle twisting into surprisingly obtuse forms lends vitality to these simple pieces the warped arpeggios which stagger zombie-like all over track 6 are stunning and would surely send crowded floors into a frenzy track 8 is just as cocky with tambourines and gushing strings cycling like the field track 10 re-examines the riff from supermayers two of us submerging it in darker waters and throwing in ragged jazz breaks to disrupt the flow calmer pieces recall rechenzentrum or mikkel metal with stoned rhythms lurching around dying dub pulses and barbed synth pads theres not a bum note in sight or rather the bum notes are so artfully deployed that each track develops skewed and eccentric personalities absent from all but the most innovative of modern productions
the pairing of italian artists donato dozzy and marco shuttle is packed with potential dozzys extensive output has included plenty of fruitful collaborations and shuttles patient long-form approach comes across as easily accommodating (see: his killer time to express track sing like a bird and peter van hoesens just-as-potent remix) the duos first record as sounds like a safe but logical initial effort both and are crisp modern acid techno running around seven minutes apiece and exploring the tweaked-out possibilities of a single synth line atop sparse shivering percussion whose asymmetrical 303 riff murmurs sharply as it stretches into open space has a darker more cosmic vibe is mellower thanks to a warmer almost meditative lead its also faster and with intensifying rushes of cymbals and hi-hats a little more self-contained subtle easy-to-layer acid tracks like these will always be welcome but hopefully the future will bring some more eclectic experiments from this project
several months after their impressive debut yum records returns with a three-track ep that stays true to its london roots claus is one half of the team behind toi toi a party that since 2010 has established itself a reputation as one of the capitals go-to spots for forward-thinking house and techno on the flip arguably the citys foremost purveyor of late-night oddities fabric resident craig pitches in with a rare remix regulars at toi toi will know s sets for their meandering minimal aesthetic which is reflected on interlude archives ep prominent basslines underpin both tracks allowing to experiment with varying textures and techniques the more stripped-back of the two makes a feathery atmosphere of garbled mutterings and distant knocks is more cunning masquerading initially as a slice of sharp-edged techno before a lengthy improvised jazz breakdown reveals s musical side both would fit well in the nether regions of an a:rpia:r or ricardo villalobos set same could be said of the flip which sees update to suit his tougher trippier tastes with the kind of bassline thatll stay with you for days his remix rounds out a head-turning follow-up from the yum camp
peter presta goes head to head with little carlos to deliver the next release on recordings the original of is featured alongside a bryan cox mix first up though is the original mix and i must say it certainly lacks a bit of cutting edge the track does display some good drum patterns but it s in other areas of the production where things are lacking to help make it that something a little bit special the bryan cox mix turns up the pace quite a fair bit and adds a fair bit to the release the drums and percussion are quite intense and the baselines are nicely tuned into the production gritty in its approach yet funky in its delivery this mix helps save this release from the mediocre bin check out the b-side for the finer moments of this release as it is quite a quality remix from bryan cox
cio dors die faser will likely stand as the totemic moment when headfuck techno vaulted further into the mainstream discussion of dance music its the first long-form exploration of the sound attacking it from a number of angles the subject of this first salvo from the album is one of the best a warm and flowing track that is bustling with tiny field recordings that imbue it with a live feeling that so much similar work lacks warm and flowing pretty much describes donato s career and the italian producer thusly turns up with two takes on dors the first a beatless version focuses its attention on the naked piano and longing synths that provided the underpinning for the original like much of s output it scrapes alongside the dangerous coastline of goudaville but somehow ends up running aground in tasteful town the reason his ship is steered so expertly the answer probably lies in the other remix you can tell that s bona fides are very real from his techno version of the tune an eight-and-a-half minute journey into deep bleeps he clearly gets his kicks from ambience like the first but when it comes time to drop the hammer hes all too happy to bring four beats every measure
their best were simply unbeatable y set so many standards that its almost impossible to imagine how dance music would sound without them y made some of the greatest house records of all time and entire sub genres sprang out of their ideas this four disc collection is a potent reminder of their best work and if you believe what they said in their ra exchange a precursor to new music in 2015 y compilation with is sure to be worthy of your attention this one neatly encapsulates what did best: a smoky house beat joyous vocal per mance and instantly emotive chords meld to create something totally irresistible ts a simple combination but one these guys did better than anyone else many of their most loved records and t to name another two built these seemingly simple elements into something infinitely more than the sum of their parts arguably s biggest contribution to dance music was their evolution of the remix way they could trans m pass pop records into dance floor gold was at once remarkable and revolutionary their hands mick hucknall could become a house diva thus their enduring remix of s made their name as sonic alchemists flipping the shittiest pop records into underground anthems that so much of their work was major labels goes someway to explain why so much is missing from : much of it simply may have been too expensive to license dub of trey lorenzs photograph mary an n c anthem and building block of uk garage is not included r is the dub of s e step ahead s first major label remix and one that marked a pivotal moment in their career course it would have been impossible to include everything ie vega and kenny gonzalez made over 1 500 records together but these dubs are arguably the tracks that feel most relevant today still theres enough on to keep you happy s ly r and are about as good as soulful house music can get f you dont already own these records you need this compilation
doesnt fuck around as you could guess from titles like ghettoblaster and for professional dj use only the detroit producers music is defined by an upfront no-frills mentality that and the roland 303 wilson has a knack for wailing acid lines and his records are splattered with them hes churned out some massive tracks over the past few years most notably 2009s this love a spooky acid banger that remains a dj favorite today a double-pack wilson says is influenced and dedicated to all those who have worked and lived underground might be his biggest and baddest yet has two different modes: banging but groovy and utterly brutal the first record packs in two extended blistering techno cuts fast relentless and slightly demented in the same vein as i-fs classic i do because i couldnt care less but as confrontational as they are both tracks are deceptively catchy the drum patterns are just funky enough and there are infectious quasi-melodies embedded in their sandpaper textures wilson lightens up on the second record but only a bit the a-side begins with eight bars of a shrill arpeggio then drops abruptly into a chugging deep house groove bongos mellow chords and claps but with a nervous urgency thats pure techno the a2 sinks those chords deep in the mix and brings back the first records corroded textures but it keeps things at a medium boil the b-side plays a similar track to the erupting into a heavy groove after an eight-bar intro but here the energy is more ferocious thanks to fierce hi-hats a huge bassline and a simple acid hook is nothing fancy just five no-bullshit club weapons as dirty and raucous as they come
the glasgow trio of iain cook martin doherty and lauren mayberry occupy a sweet spot in dance-leaning pop music: they skirt maudlin sentiment in radical ways on a single from sophomore album every open eye the bands synths have dimmed from the usual times square-like flash mayberry casts more shade over the song in her lyrics telling an ex-lover take care to leave a trace of a man where she often seemed to float over the music she digs right into the glassy latticed melodies of in doing so deliver one of their most rousing and anthemic songs four who normally has great form remixing records like this turns in an underwhelming version the first couple of minutes are a jumble of matte synths and homespun melodies which all seems to promise a there is love in you -style coda what we get instead is an overlong break filled with clunky samples of mayberry clattering ungracefully over each other and then a slightly bass-loaded reprise of the intro given the quality of source material its a surprise he didnt do more
with pedigree like this youd be surprised if the music wasnt ace paul ritch and djulz have respectively rolled and snapped their way to the respect of those who appreciate a more refined serious style of dance music veteran 2000 and has amongst his accolades a serpentine and popular remix of djulzs just so you know and visionquest meanwhile is shaun reeves ryan crosson lee curtiss and seth troxler what you get is a tough 12-inch with a quirky remix by the latter crew with all tracks being of a classic standard is high-energy combining a rapid choppy acoustic tech house drum programming with a sturdy techno kick a restless sub monobass and an unhinged twittering that takes over the room creating a bizarre and overbearingly heady atmosphere its extremely recognisable partly due to its bright intrusiveness; but also because its equally as characteristic 2000s mix does what it says on the tin with no messing around: the track is made by the stuttering voice of a mechanised sentinel which evokes scenes from terminator of a machine-ruled future fruity naive synth lines flop around the shiny upper regions of the spectrum in the visionquest mix while a loose springy analogue bass resonates its riff in lolloping fashion drums sit halfway between electronic and recorded offering toughness diluted with screwloose clatter you can almost see the cartoon bluebirds circling your head
james mowbray must not get much sleep he is an editor at mixmag he is a promoter he is a dj and yet he still finds time to make music that never hints at fatigue his second release on four:twenty is likewise full of energy: produced with studio buddy leiam sullivan is an uplifting house number whose fluttering melodies and euphoric waves lull you into a sense of bliss that is until a wall of bass gets poured into the mix surprisingly this heavy-handed tactic only enhances the hypnotic quality of the track and when it s finished you feel better for the journey on the b-side copenhagen art-djs ink take the track to detroit focusing on simple stabs of melody and rumbling kicks to create a nice minimal techno effort worthy of any large sound stage it does lose clarity though when the fluttering melodies of the original get added to the tougher framework but luckily for us there is a second remix which doesn t include the flowery synths leaving only techno goodness dmittedly these tracks did nothing for me on first listen they seemed like mid-nineties throwbacks rehashing themselves for an unknown audience but after a few plays their uniqueness peeks through this uniqueness has become a trademark of four:twenty and mowbray and sullivan don t let the team down one bit
might just polarize the loyal fan base of hern n catt neo the melancholy prog of his two master series comps gained him a rabid following the world over and rightfully so: his deep bass tribal drums and haunting samples made many a listener to gank a derek howell title off masters series vol 2 happy to be sad and while catt neo hasnt quite abandoned his trademark sound is a hip-shaker whether thats for better or worse will be up to the fans disc one starts surprisingly with gui boratto laying down a fat slab of minimal goodness typical of kompakt on arquipelago this segues beautifully into the oliviero mos remix of peterskys fuck them all a nicely twisted track thats not half as mean-spirited as it sounds dousk makes a welcome appearance halfway through with the dreamy and floaty florence which is truly beautiful (despite my lame choice of adjectives) but paolo mojos 1983 is an infuriating inclusion: the daft punk-like tinkling synths and the early 90s house piano make for a real throwaway of a track the worst however has to be with my friends by randall jones presents djs set you free the beat is nice and eerie but the straight-up track after track of hotness vocal is lame wigger talk that makes the whole thing laugh-out-loud horrible luckily phonique and erlend ye are there to pick up the pieces with the catt neo tonks remix of for the time being though i vastly preferred monteros dub off dave seamans masters series vol 7 disc two reminds me of the second disc of global underground 014: hong kong as both digweed and catt neo plumb the darker depths of progressive house with the same solid sleaze catt neo kicks off with bushwacka s beastman a monstrous track that chews up a sample from leftfields dusted over a malevolent bassline but destiny by 16 bit lolitas is where the second disc really starts to get filthy with heavy doses of pounding rhythm squelchy bass and scattered claps the remix of mehta riedel s stripped-down obsessions sounds like tribal warfare but the highlight of has to be the pushers scorching version of dan weltons lisopain which is straight-up hotness equally at home at a sultry outdoor rave or at the movies when the hero is chased through the jungle by enraged natives catt neo polishes off the disc with sirocco his and john tonks follow-up to the immortal introspective breaks of warsaw its a hard act to follow and they dont quite pull it off but the track is still a nice prog house roller uplifting and cool without being cheesy or pretentious hern n catt neo s mixing and sequencing are predictably superb but his track selection leaves something to be desired suffers from the same problem as seamans masters series: one cd is face-meltingly rad the other merely so-so seamans disc one was nearly perfect while catt neos disc two is the half that truly soars taken as a whole the biggest disappointment of is the track selection: the tracks seesaw between gemstones and coals and its hard to keep your finger off the skip button
four years ago youd never in your life guess this peppy thing however dark its tonality and precise its production had come from kode9 and the spaceape thats how far dubstep has traveled theres something calm about this record that fits its position in between so many other tracks that kode9 clearly tasked himself with making sound definitive this is a corner piece not a center one that doesnt make it any less lovely t about two minutes we get the silvery synth wash fans will remember this device the first time one of them announced itself to me that sudden sheet of impenetrable gleaming sound that cut the track at a completely different angle than i was anticipating was of course on a signal release by kode9s label hyperdub rusties remix of zombys spliff dub and it nearly split my brain open kode9s version of it is far finer laser-like; it illuminates corners of the track more than it disrupts them that it seems to announce itself as a variation on a theme effective though it is cant help but say something about the way eruptions eventually settle themselves down
hardware-built house is certainly nothing new and (jean brazeau) isnt pretending that it is the vancouver dj/producers first outing for is a collection new age-inspired dance music with an urge to jack borrowing as much from 808 state as mr fingers nearly all six productions balance a languid atmosphere with busy drums swaggering basslines and sumptuous melodies brazeau seems to know exactly what hes doing with this material and he keeps inspired and exciting despite its roots in well-worn sounds some records best tracks feature live instruments (or an approximation re ) which gives brazeau a chance to show f his soulful melodic touch the rhodes in appears during tunes quiet breakdown and its burnt chords lend it some heartfelt punctuation before launching into finale delivers exactly what its title promises a wistful floor-filler with exuberant saxophone the instrumentation in of is all retro-digital synth pads and blasted 909s but brazeau injects satisfying musicality with his casual keyboard flourishes its a rare moment when celestial vibe grows tiresome but once of the comes on at track five beatless nearly eight-minute piece feels somewhat laborious the slow drift does eventually pay f though acting as a sort extended intro to understated closer a s t-focus production mist haze caps f brazeaus debut release like its reminiscing on previous 30 minutes music

active since the early 90s lived the gritty new york dance history that label references his production career continued into the minimal years and he now works as a mastering engineer (with among his clients) but his 90s-era techno energetic trippy often pretty aggressive sounds more current now than it has at any time since it was produced a collection of tracks that have languished on dats for years is the proof this is strange menacing techno hard when it needs to be and weird in all right places it could have been made last week is the most energetic quick-stepping along in the high 130s scratchy hi-hats and acrid piano chords seem to be constantly skipping free of the bassline snarl beneath them occasionally it all stops for a booming electro breakdown before picking up the chase again is caustic electro its synth and voice stabs throbbing like an infected wound s atonal synth loops could be jeff mills-style brain melting if the whole thing had a bit more pace schoenemann takes the patient approach bleeding in bongo syncopations and eardrum-tickling high-end for a disorientating climax closer reboot demonstrates that schoenemann can do deep with just as much flair this is tribal techno for the comedown with gorgeous synth pads wandering thoughtfully across the frequency spectrum before stealing into the night
i met henry keen in cuba last year where he and his brother ollie were putting together a collaboration with the local band ache meyi for manana festival he like everyone was out of his comfort zone there working with minimal equipment tight deadlines and a language barrier collaboration which has since been released on the manana label ended up being one of the festivals best second full ep under his alias finds him on home turf even more so than 2015s homemade waves ep healing scaphoids sounds warm relaxed and comfortable in its own skin keen is a 70s baby as a recent album title put it and his music tracks the soul funk and jazz of the era via turn-of-the-millennium dance developments: deep house and crucially west london broken beat drum kits are warm and roomy replete with claps and clicks sidesticks and woody kick drums basslines are casual but firm while synths burble and coo like happy birds keen also keeps things loose structurally key motifs tend to sidle gently in and out of frame as with the keys referenced in the title of or the chord changes in the latter half of both of those tracks lope forwards on syncopated kick drums but things straighten out with the dreamy 4/4 of though its percussion twitches and swings as if trying to break free from its gentle straitjacket unsettled feeling persists on where the clap and chords sit just before the two and four unbalancing the groove a broken beat trick made new
early in his long and productive career justin k broadrick despised genre the way anarcho-punks despise the capitalist state for the young radical from birmingham the concept was a form of sonic ghettoization that had to be overthrown he waged his revolt through a string of collaborative and solo projects that approached desegregation with all the subtlety of a molotov cocktail the pioneering godflesh was born out of a high-impact collision between heavy metal and industrial; techno animal violently collapsed hip-hop ambient and noise together; the sidewinder unleashed a crust-smeared splicing of hard techno repetition and blown-out african groove from jesu to (an older alias reactivated with 2012s posthuman ) subverting genre remains the bedrock of broadricks vision today as hes grown older his means of achieving it have become decidedly nuanced hes no longer breaking down barriers and reveling in chaos so much as hes constructing sustainable interfaces between the sounds and styles hes explored since the late 80s its certainly true of the wild forceful meticulous double-lp released on speedy js label the record features plenty of broadricks trademarks: brontosaurus-sized beats sheets of static and the tension between animalistic intensity and mechanized determinacy the latter quality plays a vital role in the first two tracks recalls techno animals programmed crunch even as it sounds like an industrial-metal band is even more gnarly nailing the sweet spot between militant repetition and a troglodyte rock stomp despite the sheer enormity of s grooves the music retains a refreshing kineticism thanks to a nimble minimalist touch of syncopation a veteran with drum breaks broadrick possesses a far deeper well of rhythmic schemes than many of his brooding peers in the industrial electronic zone stands out for that reason: had the track come out in the late 90s its steamship hiss counterpoint percussion and lurching swagger wouldve aligned it with experimental hip-hop on broadrick sends that inimitable swagger through an obstacle course of jarring pivots as crud-caked synths move double-time through great billows of distortion even on the albums most technoid cut broadrick splatters drum corp-style toms snares and cymbals against a metronomic pulse the result is a kind of murky ominous industrial-grade robo-funk the severe crunchy production and impenetrable distortion of has a lot in common with the likes of andy stott (namely passed me by and we stay together ) and ancient methods at his most beastly but in terms of emotion their foreboding music stands apart from its a rare musician who could make music this bleak sound utterly engrossing
2011 keita sadanaga wood frame rinth 20 groundin
belongs to one of bristols most low-key crews fallingup alongside ndy mac and typesun hes nonetheless responsible for one of the finest singles to come from the citys house wave: 2012s try slung a detroit deep house number whose sunkissed simplicity was perfectly judged jays long overdue return to brstl is a little less dazzling the arrangements are more refined and the mood in classic fallingup style is humble to a fault nonetheless it contains a pair of pleasant deep house soaks ge is all about the gently compulsive swing that animates its toy-like percussion crisp snares and hi-hats scuff against easy-chair rhodes chords generating a charm disproportionate to the subdued mood is spicier as pistoning hi-hats give it a welcome energy boost its rhodes figures climb tirelessly up and down the chromatic ladder before fizzing out prettily in the breakdown when the whole thing snaps back into focus the synths are different and fractionally steelier a subtle sleight of hand but an effective one
nearly two years after its release continues to issue remixes from onur zers debut album for the imprint when the ones doing the remixing are isol e and aby though theres hardly reason to complain oth work very slowly at each and every thing that comes out their door meticulously crafting masterpieces of sound production sometimes that gets in the way of musical enjoyment most notably in isol es less-than-warmly received 12-inch for diynamic earlier this year (which r incidentally liked ) ut unlike that release his take on zers suffers from no lack of discernible groove instead the issue here is thats all there seems to be isol e drafts out the main hook and rides it until it breaks tweaking it ad infinitum and offering new elements every so often to liven things up its a curiously restrained bit of material from the producer and one that doesnt quite hit as a result that same sort of minimalism is present in aby s remix of ida but its spooky vocal atmospheres and endlessly chattering percussion cohere to produce something that is more effectively hypnotic its full of the sonic detail that isol e provides but the hook is smoothed out into a lengthy drone letting the complexity breath rather than forcing things to happen simply trusts in his loops to deliver the goods luckily they very much do
ive never been to china i only know what the west is telling me about china recently told pitchfork while discussing her debut album that cultural disconnect is the central tenet of a record that takes the listener on a journey through imagined china the country as portrayed in western media aims to expand on sinogrime a loose thread of grime where artists who knew very little about china clumsily appropriated eastern scales and instrumentation for al qadiri that means taking her streamlined beats and embellishing them with an array of mallet percussion midi string instruments and self-consciously asian-sounding melodies if that sounds like cultural appropriation well thats kind of the point the bigger question is whether the music itself holds up the record begins with a haunting cover of nothing compares 2 u called the chinese term for pirated goods the lyrics are written in nonsense mandarin rendering what sounds like a heartfelt performance from fung ultimately meaningless but even with a haughty introduction settles into a zone that sounds a whole lot like al qadiris past eps desert strike and genre specific xperience those (excellent) 12-inches sounded like grime with its innards scooped out here al qadiri adds an exotic topcoat to those ominous basslines and creeping synths lending the whole thing a sinister and grandiose undertone each track on corresponds to a different region or idea the disembodied vocals and fluid synths on hint at the mythology of the historically spiritual mountain range the plasticky pomp of reconciles its namesakes imperial history with its current status as a glitzy tourist destination uses a swift mallet melody to convey the vastness of chinas open roads most striking of all is which portrays one of chinas fastest-growing cities once a tiny village now has a reputation for abundant prosperity living next to seedy crime the same economic imbalance that inspired grime in london in the first place as such is also the most straightforward uk-style tune on the record and it proves that al qadiri can nail a club cut when she wants to those are all killer tracks even when you remove the context which makes the chinese flourishes feel gimmicky the problem with is that it doesnt go much deeper than merely pointing out that this unrealistic vision of china exists theres no greater commentary or anything useful to take away from it and at some level it could be considered offensive dressing up surface-level appropriation as something smarter sounds better when heard as an experimental grime album and left at that you certainly dont need to know anything about china to enjoy it and maybe thats the key: the lp positions al qadiri as just one in a long line of grime producers finding inspiration in the same problematic yet awe-inspiring vision of the east
if i ever manage to moonwalk (not the mj thing) i might well choose the a side to as the soundtrack its not so much that it has a stereotypical cosmic feel; its just that the synths are so drained of colour as to be dead lifeless space incarnate is a label from madrid and the founder leads off the release with an icy number punctuated by blipping transmissions hi hats and the accompanying cymbal taps never try to establish a charged rhythm with the sparse bassline the three float weightlessly about bumping gently into one another before moving off to their next collision it might have been a plain track but for a chirping cricket like noise which appears at unexpected times in bloodless synths again play a large part but this time theyre more like bridges rather than a canvas its a little reminiscent of zadigs oo_d from june; hook focussed with an emphasis on effects motif isnt as strong though; its really the tracks shifting backdrop which makes the whole thing worthwhile b side is awarded to another spaniard a fairly typical slice of dub sets about restoring some vibrancy to the record however where similar tracks can take on a viscous even sluggish feel has a lighter quality; its spangled chords sailing above the striding bassline finishes the task; a joyful and unexpected ditty given the airlessness found elsewhere on the record taking a seemingly endless number of crystalline chimes and gleeful arps cycles methodically between them for some it might slip too far into syrupy sweetness for others the twanging analogue bass and faint sense of euphoria will be irresistible
i ve never seen him live but after hearing fabriclive 34 it s plain to see why has nabbed breakspoll s best award three years in a row his track selection casts a wide net in all directions but his mixing remains clean tight while also leaving ample room for turntable trickery interventions while his debut artist album from last year was overproduced overly soft s fabriclive 34 is a potent blend of laidback vibes upfront breaks with most importantly a good sense of humor something that s been lacking in the series lately is called in for hosting duties here but after also kicking off the scratch perverts fabriclive 22 their watch ride mix from earlier this year a shift from obligatory mic controllers is in order from dyna s intro we re treated to a tasty acapella of of the s hip hopper i m over the beat by contemporary ss effective is the rap classic cut with s breaks stormer still does manage some er crafty under the radar looping tempo raising to kick his mix into full breaks mode from there on out the head of the pack is by a bitch slap to techno thus ironically most of the fellow fabric series makes a poor choice of follow up with s breaks : drive at five breaks that can only bring to mind a stripe shirted b t tool raising his smirnoff ice to the track s sole hook: it s the weeeeeeeek eeeeeeeend s vip mix of goes a long way in making it heavier more danceable than the minimal funkin original segue of sirens transitions it beautifully into the album s best track s which only further cements them as the best producers in breaks period takin salsa dances out of breakbeat before whisks in s mash up of s new wave classic him with s booty bouncing vocal from wizard s in the but the best part is s devastating slam into the m remix of by : absolute dancefloor wreckage s e is a sour moment toward the end with vocalist doing his best ludacris impression since poor breaks producers probably can t afford the real thing s use of s 94 cut y as the album closer doesn t work quite as well as he imagined either as it feels like something you d hear as the lights go up while doing the bitter/drunk/comedown shuffle toward the exits the very least though it ll inspire you to throw the album in for another spin that s the beauty of this particular fabriclive : it feels like a genuine night out at a show but one you can relive again again
part of what was impressive about dan snaiths jiaolong was the number of indie-dude-does-dance-album pitfalls it didnt fall into there was no excessive focus on melody no hangdog confessions no lack of groove or fun the latest single from snaiths daphni project is a collaboration with another established indie figure owen pallett and it complicates things wonderful as it can be its difficult to think of anything less suited to a dance floor transposition than palletts brand of fiddly symphonic pop nor is there much call for a violin in the club (outside of a philly string section that is) fortunately these two tracks arent nearly as offensive as they couldve been i mean yes rendering a uk funky-style semitonal melody on a real violin rather than a brash synth-string patch as these two do on does miss the point a little but snaiths oddball techno backing more or less makes up for it while a periodic upward swooping bassline shows his intimate knowledge of dance floor mechanics is odder but less coherent pallett supplies a bunch of effects scratchy stepladder melodies glowering drones glissandi which are laid out in succession over a heads-down techno beat at times the combination is impressively pungent at others kind of annoying snaith is maybe best off forging ahead on his own but this is an intriguing detour along the way

unlike electronic music designed for dancing where micro-scenes become a kind of cultural ideology for the groups that gather in their temples by night electronica is less inclined to pursue agendas with the exception of the artificial intelligence series on warp in the early nineties which brought together aphex autechre and plaid to define the template for electronic listening music its trajectory has been dictated by a series of idiosyncratic producers or labels a boards of canada here a jan jelinek there perhaps its this lack of agenda that has turned 25-year-old london producer back to electronic musics earliest incarnations on his third album his first for herb following releases on scottish electronica stalwart benbucula as the tongue-in-cheek title suggests references to the early dabblings of composers like xenakis and edgard var se abound bbc radiophonic workshop legend derbyshire is among those that marchment explicitly references in his sampling of 40s 50s and 60s oddities repainting them in figurative shapes to suit ears raised on the glitch and crunch of more contemporary structures the woozy analogue textures that result frequently recall boards of canada especially in the gorgeous opener which builds a patina of textures of barely perceptible difference to express a simple melody likewise squeezes dusty electronics through the tube to spit out chunky exotic machine funk named after the author of the futurist manifesto shares its namesakes embrace of the disorientating potential of technology like a soundtrack to losing control of your car it evokes the thrill and uncertainty of the new less successful are the albums more generic moments; while pretty fails to take root in the subconscious in quite the same way as which follows it with a bonkers deconstruction of stuttering dubstep if marchment is a little too conscious of his forbears even those most producers struggle to pronounce the vision that begins to take shape on this record is one of a music that probes the possibilities of a digital language founded on the eccentricities of its analogue past whos afraid is at its best when this interplay is instinctive when the memories of the future flow most fluently
for a minute there few producers in the us underground were as prolific as jason letkiewicz recording either as steve summers confused malvoeaux lan hurst sensual eings or death commando he was one of the cornerstone acts on l i e s doing dusty analog jams that could veer into house techno or even horror soundtracks with ease ut the man fell silent the past three years and only came back into view early this year with his death commando project now letkiewicz revives his dormant alias and returns to the label that released his first seven-inch eight years ago coinciding with max ds long-delayed oost and will dimaggios fusion ( roadcast mix) (a contender for track of the summer) this 12-inch could get lost in the mix dont let it as both sides prove letkiewiczs sensibilities remain whetted opens with a tough kick and hi-hat combo that brings to mind the spiky disco-punk patterns of df s remix of le tigres deceptacon the track quickly jumps into a heady new space however adding deft touches of chimes and bells that suggest a zooted mindstate even as things chug along and gather steam moves deeper into that cloudy zone: sluggish murky strange subliminal barely-there murmur propels the track it never shakes the haze (an effect that brings to mind early terekke) as it moves with queasy chords only a steady ride cymbal keeping it grounded its an effective and mysterious track that will hopefully mean theres more to come from one of letkiewiczs numerous aliases

is undeniably one of the finest producers in australia at this moment to use an overabused term everything he seems to touch turns to gold is another masterpice from luke and its a long overdue release for receiving massive airplay from the likes of ben korbel locally to john digweed internationally for the last year and a half the original mix gets a release with a fantastic addition on the flip in a breaks rework on the a-side is the original mix a track which featured on ben korbel trent anthony s kiss fm mix in early 2002 some dark 4/4 beats and drums begin the track as whistles and bird like sounds fade in and out at a very low volume slowly but surely soothing wailing effects roll in and out of the track and the drums build as the overall outlook builds in momentum the track starts to reach its climax deep into the record as all the elements; drums subtle synths wildlife and little eerie effects all meet to produce a brilliant production by arguably one of the finest producers in australia as we speak on the flip is the very unique midnight in cyberfunk remix this is quite simply a stunning rework of the original by luke the track takes a more breaky approach but what is clear as well is that there are almost 2 separate tunes in one the first half of the track is almost completely different to the latter half the track builds with a solid beat pattern and effects fading in and out and also some nicely arranged melodies later on the track however takes a turn for the twisted halfway in as a vicious baseline takes control and the beats become more erratic in an enticing way a high-pitched electro melody also gains power in the track as the pieces in the puzzle blend to produce a creepy result one of the finest productions this year so far needless to say this is an essential purchase both mixes do the damage luke strikes again
jump up drumnbass fans would instantly recognize the name of having previously worked on urban takeover releases with aphrodite and mickey finn and also being credited with the first remix of a fatboy slim track - rockafeller skank now hes back on doing both the nu-skool breaks thing and a drumnbass track as well side a listen to the basstone rolling breakbeats and a very heavy but catchy bassline should be an instantly recognisable melody once it gets played in clubs the snare drums sound long and stretched out like a drumnbass 45 being slowed down to 33rpm it works well and is definitely a must for any fans of thumping breaks tunes side b rub my boomstick back to his drumnbass guise which we all knew him for rub my boomstick is s take on vandals classic track boomstick from last year if youve heard the original then youll remember it is a deep and dark breaks tune with some nice bass stabs and samples from evil dead 3 - army of darkness s take on it is not really jump up and sounds a bit more like what ram records and tru playaz artists are doing nowadays - crisp rolling breaks with tight snares stabby kick drums lots of percussion heavy bass and plenty of build ups to get the crowds going wild personally it doesnt seem to have the oomph that the original version has and sounds better at around 130 bpms instead of 175 its good to see embrace drumnbass like they do with breaks and maybe this realease will open up new doors for new artists to come through for people who really are into both drumnbass and breaks then this release is a must have for fans of releases then listen to the basstone will suit and should get a crowd jumping
even before its fledgling scene was decimated by mounting police pressure bassline never got much attention from electronic music media maybe it was sound itself all dance music is functional but its hard to imagine anything more so than this specific blend of swung 4/4 beats and garagey bass wobbles is one producer who always stuck true to form with 2008s wot he had one of scenes few bona fide an ms after a brief hiatus he returned with a number of great singles on labels like unknown to unknown and latter outfit has just released s debut album it seems strange that this torch-bearer for a sorely under-represented scene should make an album so unashamedly pop re will be a large contingent of fans that will hear and immediately accuse of selling out just as re is any time an artist starts making music with mass appeal this would be an unfair reaction isnt sound of someone sticking to a formula for a quick buck if anything its most daring record has ever put out unfortunately that doesnt mean its any good shows q playing around with multiple genres and sounds and end result is simply missing raw grittiness that his fans loved re are a few tracks where its nearly re at points feels like trademark q but its peppered with a trancey euphoria that just feels cheesy - is less bassline than it is trappy dubstep a strong vocal performance from cant save from feeling like a weak todd edwards track and has to be among most saccharine drum bass tracks ever produced watered down breaks for peak moments in festival sets thats not to say re are no high points dubstep swagger and foreboding bass of manages to cut through sickly sweet synths in background and is pure rolling ukg at his finest is ano r strong dubsteppy number this time with bizarre vocals from jayjayborntosing and it might be a london sounding lad ranting with little attempt at reaching any pitch or melody but it works and it would comfortably be albums highlight if it wasnt for casual misogyny pouring out of every line sees take a swing at something new this approach should be applauded and could even win him some new fans but its safe to say i wont be one of m
theres a group of french producers who are threatening to oust the dauphins of distortion from their current throne in a revolutionary return to their countrys ancien regime of house jef k and chris carrier are noteworthy conspirators in the gathering though the resolutely dependable is also a key combatant against the noise which has been drowning out an active and commendable scene ever since daft punk bought leather jackets and justice crossed the waters of nazareth the man behind is no great innovator his records owe evident dues to dj sneaks technique and work samples plucked from a familiar pool though he is very good at what he does always jacking always funky rarely cornball variety not really but thats ok when you consider almost any track from his discography could be selected practically by roulette and your set would be better off for it with that in mind you know pretty much what to expect from a funk loop added bass cowbell the classic ingredients that knows to blend adeptly the vocal track about spreading the house vibe party time spoken in a thick gallic accent (presumably part of the revolutionary propaganda) is a bit much but with an instrumental version included alongside a dubbed-out ghetto mix theres little reason not to follow marianne all the way to the discotheque

techno is best understood as a design problem: how do you build a track with the fewest possible elements jpls and ambivalent tackle this question by returning to the days of daniel bells blip and beep pegging each song on s to a single eponymous sound offers a decent loop with a thundering kick drum and a wavering synthesizer that slowly drifts into the foreground but not much else happens the action is on where a fat keyboard stab is coaxed into a wide-swinging chorus that chops and rolls across a peppy drum kit you can feel the effect of each knob being nudged as the sound breathes and growls across the top and bottom of your speakers performs a similar trick pairing a badass snarl with a purring high-end that marries the best elements from jpls and ambivalents solo efforts ( activatroy and nugget ) the digital version of s is bundled with two filler tracks is basically in reverse with a curved tone dragging across the drums yet the effect is more cartoonish than its forward-facing counterpart theres a moment in jplss remix of the same track when the skittering percussion evokes the mad energy of plastikmans 1993 classic spastik without coming anywhere close to its physical shock i found myself worrying that fifteen years later minimal techno has become a formal exercise rather than a futuristic genre defined by gutsy invention fortunately the raw grind of and keeps this nagging concern at bay

this single is s first release since the brilliant fabric 63 arguably the crowning moment of the new york producers steady rise to fame that mix was veritably crammed with exclusives all of them as you might expect excellent so its high time one found its way onto wax one of the mixs understated highlights is about as minimal as vincent gets not much more than an enormous creamy kick drum overlaid with a trebly synth texture a moroder arpeggio gutted and left in the dark its all in the details though: the occasional punctuating dead-eyed squirls of noise the exceedingly subtle tension and release dynamics that speak of deft fingers on careworn faders its confrontational minimalism makes it an intensely heady experience but its also pure body music just an all-encompassing kick drum counting down the seconds to dance floor oblivion final surprise comes in the form of a gorgeous chorale-like coda: rich flute-like chords that could be schmaltzy if overused but after all the unremitting darkness make for a moment of spine-tingling release the pleasures dont let up on the b-side is terrifying even by vincents standards an apocalyptic stomp over which bursts of noise spar with gaseous tightly syncopated pads: the sound of a geyser field dancing perhaps finally specks is a nice counterweight to all the gloom and the most overtly new york thing here with its lithe double bass riff and slinky swing although its peppered with vincent trademarks: basic channel-esque dub chords rhythmic snippets of breathing make no mistake though that pitch-black warehouse atmosphere still looms ready to rear up and envelope us in an instant
when first debuted on with soft vision ep project seemed like an agreeable if unremarkable take on 80s baiting chillwave maybe not most distinctive music ever but it worked well with labels recent summery narrative strand fast forward to chris wards debut album and hes turned from bedroom synth enthusiast to one-man-band for better or for worse sounds like work of a real human and wards own androgynous but soothing (and heavily effects-laced) vocals are all over record instead of mangled murmurs that coated previous ep normally at least for me this kind of move into indie rock territory by o rwise electronic artists is troublesome if not just for coat of vanilla it tends to introduce but for all that still feels swampy and of course electronic enough to be on mu all its still hard to sound like a proper band when every instrument leaves behind cloudy vapour trails in thick humidity like its colourful blur of a cover might suggest is visual music to utmost relying on pseudo-synaes tic triggers and reactions to give its traditional songcraft an arty weight and its formless experiments some spontaneity and nuance ward doesnt just rely on elephantine swa s of sound (there might be shoegaze touches but it never smears too much ) the difference from previous material is most pronounced in rhythms often driven by choppy drum kits that wade through heat-induced smog though he accents rhythms with occasional drum fills rudimentary rigour lends it a motorik feel that brings it sometimes uncomfortably close to deerhunter in fact everything right down to wards apa tic vocal cadence is a dead-ringer for atlanta psych rock band an apparent influence that he cant always shake off on get over that comparison (most prevalent in vocal-heavy tracks like ) and nagging feeling that like soft vision before it isnt doing too much of anything different and youve got an album full of pleasantly wistful daydreaming while songs might be grounded by ir determined drums-bass-guitar setup enormous amount of reverb creates hallucinogenic folds and pockets for wards array of synth sounds to lazily drift out of; so when incisive guitar chords on arent grabbing your fancy trickling trail of chimes and flutters probably will in fact thats one of best things about : whe r youve got it on background listening or full-on dissection its fully reversible and has something for every situation you can throw at it while it might not be as fiercely individualistic or visionary as a room(s) or a you stand uncertain debut album stands its ground as a promising start for an artist still figuring out exactly what he wants to say
in the second volume of their remix series juno follows up the success of carl craig s rethink of faze ction s in the trees with a couple of remixes of of by is an exotic sounding venture that was quite the house track back in the day getting spins from mr fingers and tony humphries among others and a listen to the original club mix included here will bring you back to those days when balearic ruled ibeefa it s classic piano led-house in the vein of sueno latino which might not be all the rage these days but hang on scenesters theres some remixes fans of the deep house resurgence will be pleased to see frenchboy julien on the tracklist here his remix is more electronic in feel than his famed swimming places type productions built on an analogue bassline and a toned down rhythm section this is definitely the most energetic and fresh sounding of the remixes on offer managing to marry the keys of the original to a harpsichord for a pulsing eight minutes the pearns and effort isn t much chop it s a grotty guetta-style cut that s basically the egg vs of by the end of this track if youve managed to last that long unfortuntely that egg is stinking to high heaven but if you like aerobics workout music then check out the hotstuff matey 1990 was a long time ago but those idealistic days spawned many a classic juno have chosen well here and the revival of makes this a quality package worth having
t this point might be the most inspired label in ristol over the past few months theyve released two 12-inches that are about as bold and imaginative as dance music gets: pevs ztec chant and lex coultons war games / pointe noire the latter of which came out on dnous ytivil a side-label for artists from outside livitys core trio (peverelist kowton) their hot streak continues with the latest two-tracker from like the best tracks brings out the architectural qualities of rhythm its a sequence of angular percussive loops carefully arranged to form a complex but perfectly balanced whole you get the feeling that if you slipped one out the whole thing would topple in on itself like a jenga tower theres nothing here aside from drums but there doesnt really need to be the stop-and-start rhythm is catchy enough on its own with its standard 4/4 rhythm feels conventional by comparison but its just as elegantly constructed and a bit warmer thanks to some ambient flourishes and a single soothing chord oth feel impossibly tidy and well-honed and reflect a sense for composition thats somewhere near flawless
how might the world end in the four-part the end is ne r series killekills sub-label explores this increasingly pressing question noxious acid techno record from dez williams suggested nuclear apocalypse (or its irradiated aftermath) kamikaze space programmes four-tracker might represent the steely churn of mechanised total war and eeoo s twisted hybrids conjured some kind of biological weaponry the series finale from the german veteran brings to mind something less grisly but no less terrifying its two techno tracks high-intensity tools of the jeff mills school suggest a meltdown of information infrastructure their frantic atonal synth loops mimicking flows of data gone haywire the results arent pretty on a recurring bell-tone sounds panic-stations while staccato synths scrabble desperately to escape the faster is even more deranged its sinewave holding-pattern shrieking along in the low 140 pm range every now and then another synth line swerves across the mix in disregard of the tracks barrelling momentum when things get this bad its every synth for itself
no this isnt kevin saunderson but isnt as far from rust belt electronics as one might presume has been the principal outlet for the belgian musician draak jagers since 2010 jagers sound is variable but generally centers around a simultaneously caustic and soothing type of synthesizer drone recent efforts namely his 7-inch for nna tapes jagers has attempted to merge this sound with a techno sensibility (read: beats) an idea he furthers here albeit a bit more abstractly scene throughout is reminiscent of tarkovskys stalker permeated by a kind of eerie high-contrast industrial calm even the cover essentially a formless gray smudge is suggestive of plumes of factory smoke jagers sets the scene early on with the compressed creak and muffled vocals of while hardly a pop song its one of his most deliberately structured pieces to date track serves as a jump-off point for a series of strangulated ethereal compositions which often resemble a score for an imaginary film offering distended variations on particularly toxic-sounding synthtones even so isnt totally grim and shapeless at begins like an extremely distorted lo-fi take on vangelis-style ambience and ends up swirling around a filtered live-drummer-insinuating pound in its final minute is a brief but surprisingly beautiful sketch as jagers gets a foggy twinkling drone to levitate above and then merge with cavernous bass pulses is a smoldering corrosive behemoth its pervasive rumble lending more than a hint of ominousness to the trembling smudged synths underneath throughout one gets the nagging feeling that these tracks have some kind of backstory jagers may be a lo-fi operator with a proclivity for smothering his sounds but his imagination operates on an epic scale
i really struggle with music and musicians who take themselves too seriously lessio natalizia said last year considering the intimate pop of banjo or freakout and the stately ambient techno of walls his latest project is natalizias clearest stand against po-faced music by filtering his punk noise post-punk and kosmische roots through an arch approach to production natalizia sounds right at home on is the brashest record to date his earlier full-lengths umwelt and redacted merged walls indie leanings with a moody cinematic sound last years nimals as holly dicker noted cast off into unfamiliar and experimental approaches where the undulating synth tones were offset by harsher ingredients using bright synth splashes and pumping rhythms goes even further album could be loosely described as dance music but the tracks dont behave as though they were built for djs sounds like its overheating from the start the snare backfiring against acid arps and sliced vocal loops se elements then settle into a more measured thrust as though the arrangement was built the wrong way round a standout here comes to life with lurid synth shapes squashed vocal samples and brutish unstable drums that could easily derail a dj set albums high energy is balanced by tender synth-led moments ambient feels like a hose-down after the sweat-inducing fun of featuring marie davidson long ll ll is a bright yet melancholic drift nother digression doesnt fare as well s indie dance crossover isnt without merit but the delivery one lyric goes shut your mouth youre some kind of lame / watch yourself you seem kind of fake lacks the punchiness of say but thats a minor complaint and one you might expect of an album that isnt striving for smoothness s upfront sound isnt for everyone but it refuses to be ignored
milo smee doesnt tend to make things easy for himself his band chrome hoof is notorious for its elaborate shows recent production under his inary chaffinch alias heavenz gate was a 20-minute italo disco homage that made lindstrom look minimalist in comparison and that took him two years to make as he recently told juno plus the first record for his label recorded under the new alias seems like it was a lot more effortless ccording to the same interview smee spent three days with a borrowed 303 and an 808 filling up a hard drive in the process however came together it sounds spontaneous with a gnarled acid line in constant mutation over a no-nonsense drum groove the slow tempo contributes to its particularly malevolent feel; so does the distortion which seems less like an effect added on top and more like a substance eating away at the sound from within dvanced dials up the tempo to a quick electro clip tearing into a blippy top line and relishing heart-stopping dropouts and aberrant asides wearing its fondness for drexciya and dopplereffekt on its ragged sleeve its not something you could call groundbreaking but that doesnt make it any less inspired; theres ample infectious pleasure in every bar

sultan follows up the very successful shivers with on featuring zara another amazing vocal talent adding their own sound to this package is nick k and richard earnshaw the original is silky smooth piece full of gorgeous synths sublte basslines and simple beats zaras vocal is floated softly over elements while a nice guitar sample echos after each verse the simple chorded melodies are very pleasing while the vocal never over shadows the production nick k is up next as he hardens the drums and adds a little flare with electro-like effects and gritty synths a grinding bassline drives this track along while the squeeling of sustained synths play perversly with a sample of the vocal the production is seemless with all elements meshing so nicely that you forget that its a remix would love to hear a dub version of this rounding off the remixes is richard earnshaw as he delivers a straight up west coast style mix with piano melodies while tweaking the original guitar adding to it a twang bouncy basslines and happiness all round is the mainstay here while the vocal gets front stage treatment throughout the mix as an extra goodie have provided a track by sultan called whatever here we see strong beats and rasping percussion create a driving feel while heavy guitar samples and riffs play havoc with your ears the guitars are heavily effected and are rarely assisted by other elements as a release the quality and variation will suit many in the house department sultans productions are always of the finest quality while fast rising star nick k delivers what i feel is the standout here
wax:on residents nathan liddle-hulme and timothy clerkin have been turning out consistently excellent eps from similar ingredients chunky vintage synths popping percussion and extra-meaty basslines since 2009 in they have another set of toothsome mid-paced electro/techno cuts destined for the dj sets of ivan smagghe daniel avery and the like is a particularly heady delight with clanking synth stabs brightly illuminating a landscape of creeping bass s central bass riff calls to mind an updated more sedate take on blackstrobes early 00s hits and its insistent maximal percussion and synth textures invite similar comparisons pulp mix of the title track brings an even heavier bass synth down onto sharp percussion and spacey echoing high notes meanwhile is a robotic chugger with cut-up voice samples augmenting another ominous bassline and retro-futuristic percussion flourishes
in a review of freestyle maven bbie b writer frank kogan once copped to mishearing her hit lookout weekend instead of sussing smoke machines and laser rays he instead heard fuck machines and razor blades perhaps he was instead hearing this 80s cut that language has taken to editing on dont the intent on being deviant and lurid its a sluggish synth-heavy track that if its not screwed is at least feeling the effects of some powerful quaaludes its hard to imagine a prime time for this save to say that it might take the right combination of early morning and blood chemical levels to work its effect properly not quite fuck machines and laser rays its at the very least a mashing of smoke machines and razor blades on the flip the heretofore unknown (to me) umps builds up a slow epic disco monster with congas flute and piano s the purred female vocals start echoing across the surface it begins to gather steam with flashes of strings and a cavernous guitar lick y the time it reaches the chorus of feeling red hot for you it gets quite sultry indeed
simple one is the first collection from will saul s label and is a straightforward no frills set of eleven tracks put together by saul and artists he has worked with in the past sideshow precision cuts and walking hintenaus because there are only eleven tracks the mix can unfold at a natural unhurried pace and sideshow s waiting in the darkness paints a cool nocturnal soundscape that slowly grows in substance saul s own fast lane is typical of the sound of the album driven by slow but meaty bass lines and minimal textures not much treble here sometimes the music is in need of a little extra colour and more textural variety but it s a mostly solid affair occasionally saul rubs shoulders with techno with mathew jonson s remix of sideshow s slide a case in point or he merges house and breaks as in the move between precision cuts royal flush and walker hintenaus pinrose which is easily the most exciting moment on the disc as the beats converge and 303s fire around the edges simple one shows plenty of promise and is an atmospheric assured first release if you re into cass and the sabotage sound this is a logical next port of call
after records from sangue de cristo and label founders photonz lisbons imprint turns to another portuguese producer pal + who makes a rather astonishingly assured debut is engrossing from the get-go with a tough syncopated chug that sounds like marcel dettmann gone reggaeton that alone would have made a perfectly serviceable drum tool but pal + doesnt stop there over the top he layers a great shimmering arc of a synthesizer melody with long sustained notes ringing against softly stabbing chords if you listen closely there are even birdcalls deep in the mix adding subliminally to the tracks wide-open sense of space brooding is darker and grittier with cheap-sounding synths staking out a position smack dab between chicago house and london grime again theres a lurching sense of swing to the groove that seems to be a hallmark of portugals bass producers right now remixing erlins snuff suck virtually all of the melody on the track concentrating on a relentless jacking drum-machine jam a rigid staccato rager so airless it feels almost vacuum packed
since peeling back from his lazer sword partnership and transplanting to erlin ntaeus roys heretofore-hidden 4/4 passions have taken centre-stage in his work as debuting proper on hotflush ukg saccharin and vigour were poured into the labels atmospheric mould in further with time out offering a more despondent than danceable pastiche of groove and bass he has taken a particularly imaginative approach on remixes his version of ghostpoets liiines for example is barely recognisable and even though he wanders a well-trodden path his nomadic dance cocktails have been both balanced and moreish renowned for looking forward and back with its equally weighted series of reissues even the new stuff from rush hour has had a retro feel from raille to cosmin trg follows suit in the title track breaks 90s pop-house hit show me love over a syncopated drum pattern and twists it out of euphoria with threatening ardcore synths on the other hand sees him approach uk bass with a lazer sword cap on to produce a glitched-out night slugs instrumental charged with future garage emotion while isnt exactly breaking ground and indeed joins the ever-growing pile of multi-referencing records its familiarity is its charm
i fell in love with techno because it boils down to one beautiful thing: the thrill of the bold new record that shows up in the middle of the night without any explanation electronic music is about the mysterious frequencies issuing from a speaker in a concrete basement and revealing strange new worlds from artists who refuse to give you anything to hang onto nonymous diffuse and cloaked in mythology: this is how records like losing control and phylyps trak ii made the rounds 15 years ago and its heartening to see this approach is still alive in todays age of digital chatter the latest record from the camp is filed under and this applies to the genre too techno lounge dubstep i cant figure it out what i can tell you is that i havent been this excited about a record since jichael macksons reitling orbiter 8 or going further back thomas rinkmanns entry into the 20 to 2000 series does exactly what it advertises buzzing and looping like a busted videogame soundtrack with a few high tones that keep creeping up the scale and twisting the screws the tension is stretched so tight that when a few sharp hi-hats pop up at the last minute the effect is devastating despite its low-slung tempo is a remarkably aggressive track and very well executed nonetheless its destined to live in the shadow of its massive sister t eleven minutes is an unwieldy machine that sounds like an old disco 45 slowed down to 33 revolutions per minute you can hear the plastic cracking and the needle jumping as it spins you into a slow narcotic haze theres a remarkably raw texture here as if the song were built from scotch tape and string little fractured gasps of soulful moaning are carefully hung along the peaks while scraps of melody blanket the floor of the track: a few swelling chords here a flight of lasers there s breaks apart around the seven-minute mark you realize what an improbable structure it is and youre left marveling at the serendipity of finding a record like this
with a mix of bass guitar live-sounding percussion analog keyboards guitar feedback and chiming bells s second single for eskimo -space breaks from the labels recent space-disco fixation towards the rock end of the spectrum (as in their recent daniele aldelli cosmic rock mix) whispered vocals tighten up into a bit about: i cant i cant believe in nothing which then turn into a dramatic near-falsetto and a group chant though fedis pout shades too close to that of s nic fer for comfort myself i cant believe that hot-dog guitar solo that fedi takes on top of the booping keyboard line midway through only to return to more shredding near the end etween the vocal style and soloing it may put more than a few people off out of s remix of the tune centers the thump and surrounds it with slivers of scratched guitar strings and tickled keys they dub out fedis word nothing and speed it up even more leaving behind the rock dynamics for a little less variation epic -side yeah makes clear fedis debt to early lcd soundsystem and their hybrid of rock and dancefloor moves it opens with seething mass of synthesized squalls live bass high-pitched guitar (at least i think its a guitar) calls and clacking percussion that gains velocity and breadth as it unfolds with its barrage of hand drums and noisy shrapnel it definitely mixes into the rock-disco sound of dfa (think j o y sunplus liquid liquids ellhead ) the breakdown emphasizes the plunked bass strings piling on more squelches and decaying synth chords before fedi pitches everything upwards and upwards ascending towards the stratospheric while slightly messy it tops the a-side
given that has spent much of the last two years reissuing his back-catalogue one has to wonder if there isnt an element of catharsis to clearing the monolake vaults as hes gotten older henke has seemed more interested in producing droning more unabashedly serious music than the dubby explorations that dominate his more rhythm-driven work as monolake its just as well because frankly henke sounds way more at home in art galleries and museums these days than he does rubbing shoulders with t++ or the host of other producers who bear the influence of his earlier more club-tilted work the first new album under any name to show up since 2006s layering buddha certainly appears to back that up the music here first began as part of an audio-visual installation with german sound conceptualist christopher bauder who has a history of turning ordinary items into sound-producing sculptures bauders previous works include a toneladder that you play by walking up and down and a midigun which allows you to shoot your way through a live performance with ableton live or other software for atom bauder built one of his most ambitious instruments to date: a large matrix of 64 helium-filled balloons attached to leds which are used to trigger sound and light to create a constantly evolving sound-and-light sculpture produced the sounds for this balloon-machine working within a framework of tight restrictions and over the course of 2007 and 2008 henke got pretty good at finding his way around the conceptual limitations then is simply that: a document of various ways henke learned to play bauders balloons and it offers the most diverse sound palette the veteran producer has ever committed to one album works with the speaker-rattling drones of 2004s signal to noise but by the time we get to and were into a side of henke we havent heard before with the former dub-techno impresario melding loops of tinny percussion and piano to concoct hypnotic cycles that have more in common with steve reich than surgeon by and weve moved further yet into the distorted contact mics more suitable to the raster-noton crew henkes all over the place here for a producer who often sacrifices a range of sounds in order to focus on atmosphere the approach is utterly refreshing may be one of henkes more conceptual outings but its also one of his most successful in recent years in his own way henke sounds like hes having fun again after years of pursuing the same path given that most listeners who come to this record will have a specific notion of what to expect from the sheer range of directions pursued is quite possibly one of the most compelling reasons to listen to this album over and over again
when alexander ridha aka alex decided in 004 to concentrate on his alias and started releasing maximalist bombs on labels such as gigolo and datapunk he was basically at odds with everything that was going on with berlin techno scene at time he immediately got much needed accolades from likes hell black strobe and tiga course but he obviously already had a well defined musical persona and agenda which he quickly imposed on o rs via remixes f bloc party ( scene defining banquet ) m e recently feist (his take on my moon my man is now as permanent part our psyche as is songstresss album version) ts no wonder n that ridha felt need to launch his label as a vehicle f his own take on what gritty electro fueled techno should be like ridhas sonic identity looms over everything that has been released on in past four years and labels first two compilation is a fitting testament f better f w se to this stubb n vision and dedication that is explained in part by fact ridha himself shows up on bnr vol under a variety aliases like puz que ( euph ic bangalter w thy dont ) ( disc ied ) and obviously ei r with iginals such as ever brutal volta 8 and menacing remixes s breaker (probably most viscerally engaging thing on here with a titillating intro lasting m e than two minutes) o rwise its labels various recent recruits that are somewhat struggling to affirm a real sense an iginal voice: s and unf tunately are all as sub bn youll ever get taken individually mind you tracks such as are effective bangers but lost amongst a 30 track 50 minute long compilation y feel slightly redundant thankfully in retrospect compilation is not as predictable as you might think at first glance f instance djedjotronics a collab ation with singer goes booty with lyrics about big butt girls set to a pumping square beat thus proving re is life in miami bass sub genre mostly known f its limited er assets same could be said about s grime y which wouldnt sound out place on a dj funk ghetto house mixtape fers with and reminders that maximalist underground techno doesnt have to be devoid hum (although inclusion ir inessential one minute skit could have been avoided) n ferociously hypnotic brodinski remix d m s (also included in its paler iginal mix) shows its still possible to make effective acid house without being overtly reverent to genres tenets finally in surprisingly humble mode ridha decides to greet us in lieu his maximal by numbers version with pandullo remix remake an talo classic his label snapped from talian label elletrica in 006 sure its probably telling that best track ever released was licensed from ano r label but when musicologists look to write maximalist genres hist y yll have to use bnr vol as one its archeological starting points m e could ridha ask f

its hard to talk about without mentioning aphex twin he makes playful references in titles like polygon pink toast and idm hooks abound on his recent album but for the most part the reference is an allusion with just the occasional exception to the rule ( midi 14-aug t4it 3 ) on however the connection is more palpable start with the digital media language ( 366 6 lhkjdgh aif ) and the misspelled words then theres the music this time sounds avant-garde and mercurial both in the compositions and across the flow of the album it begins in a buoyant playful fashion with all of s signature reference points is quasi-retro: theres a vocal there are breaks theres a moody reprieve and a squiggle of acid afterwards the title track begins like dawn ripping through an inky night it sounds crumpled and rushing with euphoria before a kick resets the mood and metallic sounds build into a noisy riot woozy downtempo follows on which also ends up flipping itself this time into funky braindance with a zing in its step continues to morph like this hitting an acidic peak on and taking a handful of ambient and downtempo dips until the end 01 might be the best of those lulls its vocal cry floats through the atmosphere above another recording that scrabbles in the dirt this too is a voice as is revealed in the closing detuned monologue without s strange additions 01 could have easily come off as a selected ambient works imitation but with them the track is a warped pastiche that sounds both strange and familiar is a maverick producer with a passion for wayward 90s techno and his label boss is a savvy curator may owe a lot aphex twin but beyond that inspiration this musical world belongs to alone
the lead cut from -ans bow takes nine minutes to play out but every time i put it on i feel like im missing something its big sounding it builds like an anthem but it doesnt impact like one whenever i try to bear down on it it fades away not usually a good sign even for records that go for dramatic backdrop more than they do hook power late in the proceedings when nomaly jonez moans smack my face/up against the wall i perk up whats going on here then the track ends until the right dj convinces me otherwise and never say never it feels like an anticlimax structurally seems a lot more aimless than yet it moves with a lot more purpose here jonezs sung refrain ( you take me to a higher place / you can tell when you take me ) is filtered so heavily that figuring out which parts are words and which are overdubbed inhalations is part of the draw not to mention that all of -ans processing makes her sound more male than female ut the track moves more urgently than the thanks to a crisp hi-hat/conga interweave as well as subtly dramatic pads and patient bass and that adds heft to jonezs ghostly presence

what kind of stuff are you gonna be playing tonight a voice asks at the beginning of s new ep a broad range comes the sheepish reply froths output is doggedly eclectic chopping up all manner of styles to create idiosyncratic party-ready new forms if theres one unifying factor its geography: the l -based producer grew up in the vicinity of london and he repeatedly looks to uk styles for cues whether classic hardcore or the hybrids of more recent years makes this tendency particularly explicit sometimes in several ways at once s rollicking broken-beat techno looks to the early 90s but its rhythmic sophistication and slick execution are closer to uk bass circa 2010 swamp81 looms even larger on with its diced vocal sample and crisp snare drums the tracks use of a siren is telling: its clearly there to convey ravey intensity but it feels too prim and perfect to really get the blood pumping froth fares better when he ratchets up the intensity for the rugged choppage of and on a broken-beat number thats swung almost to the point of dislocation nd just in case that range wasnt broad enough he throws in a hip-wiggling conga love-in that could smuggle itself into a deep house set without so much as a raised eyebrow
danny wolfers has been a perfect fit for l i e s ever since he dropped his exquisite sark island acid ep on the label back in 2011 hes since appeared on the american noise compilation and as one half of dream-house duo trackman lafonte onquiqui but this is his first solo release for ron morellis label since his debut the three tracks here are crammed with now familiar ingredients: beautiful acidic melodies springy bass and unmistakable soul it almost seems churlish to pick a standout but a straight-out floor-ready banger is of extremely high quality setting off at a faster pace than the other cuts it flies along on a gently thudding beat racing hats atmospheric arcs of synth and a pontificating vocal sample y the time a lower-pitched acid riff clanks gloriously into view images of frantic scenes in dark basements from den haag to detroit are firmly lodged in mind the squelchy beat of the title track totters along diligently laying a subtle but solid framework for wolfers trademark vintage synth lines to cavort spookily in the foreground meanwhile is a winding nine-minute synth opus thats as chewily textured as it is flavoursome
work-out album year sophomore outing ups ante on last years street horrrsing turning out six noise-techno epics brimming with sweat-soaked struggle an mic grandeur and soaring catharsis with no less than andrew wea rall on decks duo andrew hung and benjamin power get some real muscle behind m this time and beat-heavy results set m apart from fellow electronic-noise groups like black dice and animal collective on minimal throb that underpinned earlier tracks has blossomed into dense layers stampeding kraut drums that yield a frothy unbridled momentum like that a careening rocket or a runaway freight train drums are spurred on by rough bristling syn sizers that for most part spew out broad emotive chord changes recalling both brian eno and m83 see for example particularly gorgeous organ on that intones over shaking bells and driving martial snares combination propulsive percussion and an mic melodies consistently gives a vangelis-sized sense triumph when you hear flag-wavers like blistering opener you can almost imagine m covering chariots fire spraying glistening 80s classic with grit and gasoline title itself implies a kind mystic athleticism like a runners high and drawn-out peaks overdriven fire that occupy big chunks record seem well-suited for drama long distance run if i ever win a marathon on moon i want searing i/iv chords olympian to blare as i cross finish-line and collapse in lunar dust fact that buttons pull f all this fist-pumping pathos on cheapo gear makes m kind like dan deacon on ritalin while both acts are into a noisy low-budget evocation superhero glory deacon sounds like hes having a pillow fight on a sugar high and buttons ra r like y killed a blunt and n went jogging both hung and powers instruments seem to be composed mostly thrift-store synths and components filched from a radio shack dumpster and ir live show consists two piles parts and wires over which duo bob and weave toy mics crammed in ir mouths on stage two emanate slightly devilish glee a crackpot inventor watching his creations sputter to life a tottering adorable robot army encapsulates this tinkerers joy with its abundance gear-tooth clank and slot-machine clatter hung and power can get away such sonic weirdness in part because ir adaptation straight-ahead rhythms in ir recent ra interview hung describes musical freedom that comes from adopting a dance groove it becomes as he says a platform for exploration in this way allows us to look at techno as emblem a populist experimental art one that is open to new ideas but can connect viscerally with its audience at same time
s last two releases toad blinker and rotary signal emitter were notable for their dissociative techno detritus as much as for their visual component the records are zoetropic picture discs designed to be filmed at 25fps with a high shutter speed i e theyre imprinted with animations that change along with the music the duos debut for pattens label also challenges the boundaries of physical release formats though it may be slightly tricky getting a chance to experience it basically dan hayhurst and reuben sutherland jammed out the records contents and then hayhurst made seven unique dubs to c20 which are selling the proposition of such a ridiculously limited release will surely elicit eye rolls but there is something to be said for preserving the work in its original form especially for music thats alive with such a molten intensity and thankfully are offering a full-length edit culled from the seven tapes as a free download in contrast to their older work and maybe because its four long compositions rather than a bunch of short ones feels especially formless like are struggling to keep an infinite array of sounds under control this imprecision is precisely what makes the record so interesting the spontaneous moments of coalescence stand in stark relief to its blistering undercurrent of machine debris found sound and blurred samples the first part builds on an interweaving of arpeggiated blips and a loose tropical rhythm which gradually get broken up by a seething mass of noise mutations this is essentially how the other three movements unfold as well the duos sputtering tumbling rhythms either consume or are consumed by keith fullerton whitman-style synthesizer tumult in the third movement the stuttering pulsing techno that appears three minutes in dissolves into a submerged resigned organ melody before that too is smothered by a gust of blips and the fourth is like a soundclash between spare stunted drums and a carnival-esque rambunctious cacophony with each side trying to outdo the other although pattens own material is a close analogue the lp is a considerably more difficult listen though no less enthralling many recent techno-noise crossovers have threatened to fall apart at the seams but actually does and many times over
announced himself last year with jo johnson a riotous house jam that sounded like a tennis match played with iron bars finds him slide across from hot creations to its sub-label label hot trax but theres not a whole lot of difference in approach this is pumped-up good time techno with so much going on that at times its almost oppressive t its core is a constant pogoing barrage of toms and crushing hi-hats to which patches in an assault of clattering keys express-train horns and masses of delay as if hes going all out to make you submit subtle no but he succeeds in his aim such is the -sides intensity could have been in danger of feeling anti-climactic but keeps his heel pressed to your chest there are frantic cowbells bludgeoning kicks looped ragga snippets and a prolonged breakdown s 21st rave music is rather irresistible here
