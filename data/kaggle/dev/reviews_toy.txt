after morrissey s contribution to this new series from dmc it s time for to go after being a major part of one of the bands of the 90 s in stone roses this mix is very similar to a back to mine in that it is a snapshot of what tastes in music are all about not necessarily a mix cd it s more a gathering of different styles of music from hip hop to soul the first track in particular is a highlight by gza and genius in liquid swords the first half of the cd then moves into a period of reggae inspired music where fade away by junior byles acts as a particular highlight with its deep dubby baselines fug by cymande acts as a transition to more funk styles until the cd includes a bit of rock with lover by the de-lites the compilation definitely has variety and diversity on its side and unless you really have a varied taste in music then not all of the selection may appeal to you if reggae soul and funk sound good to you on one cd then this may be your thing
on the eve of their debut lp (gavin russom and viva ruiz) strip down the album cut a gooey psychedelic fro-latin number soaked in organs and his/her vocals to the bare essentials with a lot of this kind of deeply analog do-or-die live-in-the-studio stuff its one idea beaten over and over not necessarily a bad thing mind if that one idea is strong enough ut russom has a way of cutting up long hypnotic jams into passages that dont seem to have anything to do with each other and without losing any sense of continuity underpinning the nearly nine-minute-long is a single monotonic bassline not even a line just one note threaded through a bumptious 707 drum pattern; the foundation doesnt change much but the floor plan has all the twists and turns of the winchester mystery there are hissed and muttered glossolalic outbursts lcd soundsystem yelps and weirdly panned cooing choruses; the organs feel like theyve been thrown at the wall like big chunks of meat and left to slide down in bloody streaks the dub mix puts the emphasis back on the bass and organ interplay with the vocals (mostly) erased and the muted drums as cool and damp as a dewy lawn at six in the morning
the temperature drops a few degrees the moment you put on an track and his third release is no different his style is meticulous and has a steely sheen hes a master of technicalities an ep like saudade is so effective because of its intelligent design composure and all-round sleekness not that his techno is over-buffed or bookish you can totally freak out to it is a typical head trip: squirrelly and refined without a hair out of place is just shy of sounding like a paranoia-induced meltdown but keeps any rash displays pegged down tight a few mordant bubbles escape in a rush to the surface but thats it mostly the tracks make an adroit use of dynamics and tension which are in effect on the stealthy albeit in a more muted way might be s most hallucinogenic effort yet he doesnt loosen his grip but keeps the momentum as rigorous as ever allowing the details to do the subversive work
release number 3 from bristol based comes from german producer whos produced tunes for major labels such as sony universal and bmg as well as smaller labels like germanys dangerous drums and his own viperjive imprint is a dark slab of breaks infused with hip hop garage and drumnbass influences with october providing a remix side v is a electro-infused number featuring a razor sharp hook deep growling bass and a hip hop vocal which gives rise to the name as the tune progresses it incorporates more techy stabs effects and wobbles a build up on the bass and a few cleverly placed drum fills (a bit plump sounding too ) towards the end the tune kills the bass and drops into a percussive breakdown its built for a dark peaktime floor however it tends to get a bit riffy side s (october remix) vs signee october takes the tune and provides a much darker (even darker than it already is) remix incorporating a booming bassline (similar to tipper and fuel records in some sense) a new variation on the razor like hook hard hitting pads and a percussive breaks lick laced on top giving the tune an underground grimy feel
howard ernstein widely known as is a bit of a veteran he has done it all with a lot of success he has been prominent in the music industry since the early 80 s but it wasn t really until the early 90 s that became the big name that he is today working with artists such as goldie massive attack as well as co producing u2 s pop album which included an invitation to produce the live sound for its accompanying world tour not an achievement many can lay claim to despite this huge success story in the production field still tears the dancefloors apart when behind the decks this abriclive mix indicates nothing less mix starts in a quirky manner with the electro ridden by s on the other hand is a total different class breathtaking drum patterns with an exotic melody splattered with accapella which leads smoothly into the pmt mix of the same tune many should be familiar with medicine s robot induced remix of in by s trademark sound is ever present with his remix of by eautiful by is as it name suggests a beautiful fusion of breakbeat and tribal instincts the should have you hopping around with its bouncing baseline while take you eyond the early 90 s and straight into the 80 s ar provides the finale to the mix with oundation a slow reggae inspired record to slow it down to a halt this is a brilliant mix and in my opinion definitely one of the better abric releases which is a compliment in itself variety all blended masterfully has commented how difficult it was to do this mix but the results indicate that he put all his time and effort into this mix for you to simply sit back put the feet up and enjoy
the most surprising thing about s records has been their concision given each of the trios live performers has their own arsenal of modular gear it must be tempting to overstuff things but apparently last years eps for art records and brokntoys didnt go far enough on this followup for the group pare things back further the resultant electro tracks are impressively well sculpted but their subtle melodies and laser-precise drums sometimes lack distinguishing features in the eps first half simple details give the music the right smudge of colour on its a think break which lends bite to an otherwise clinical sound palette (the trio used breakbeats equally well on last years pusher ) on its a shifting melodic element which adds dynamism to a glistening battery of hi-hats and incidental percussion the other half of the ep struggles to maintain this balance s palpitating low-end isnt enough to hold attention the track feels half-empty until a sparse bassline enters in the latter half but its mixed timidly low the idm-ish is the eps most rhythmically inventive track its moods glowering menace at the opening dark melancholy later are expressed cautiously but the whole thing never quite finds its feet
a one sided 12 of the original of love is ok and odd quirky minimal techno operatic vocals hover over minimal dark drums and a haunting 3 note bassline the vocals are chopped up slowed down and repeated to form an interesting and original method of production angry twisted male speech appears later to form a contrast between warmth and sinisterness you don t hear stuff as unique as this too often these days and it s worth your hard earned dosh for that alone
produces house music where propulsive rhythms are married with raw grimy textures to often intriguing effect where his pma 12-inch on l i e s was more in keeping with that labels dusty aesthetic than his apron ep on his second release for funkinevens label beato strikes a fine balance between squelch and grit ep opens with a beatless track thats all synthesised strings and submerged vocal sample whos the in charge ovaa here is the eps highlight beginning with a bruising kick drum to which beato adds a new sound every couple of bars it remains spacious and vibrant even as it expands to incorporate a sticky bassline dreamy pads open hi-hats and rubbery synth lines snares and claps on dreamin are mucky but theyre offset by battering-ram kicks and belatedly a velvety bassline and jubilant chords brilliantly titled worship se is similarly sparse opening with echoing drum hits and a chirpy synth that makes way for abrasive pads and a sputtering groove beato reprises the submerged vocal sample of for satans a beatless coda whose centrepiece is an urgent sawing synth
not much is yet known about the label but thatll probably end soon the young swedish imprints debut 12-inch ticks all the right boxes: dance floor-friendly just weird enough to stand out and an anonymous producer at the helm whats not to like especially considering the music: somehow effortlessly merges dub techno and loopy mannheim house into a coherent package dropping a repeated vocal sample directly into an upbeat cloud of smoky 4/4 beats theres a reason its been charted by the likes of headfuck techno man samuli kemppi remote rea compatriot oris werner echocord boss kenneth christiansen tresor resident suzi wong and slow motion house man cottam isnt quite a crossover gem like the flip the way it reworks dub techno fundamentals however is equally as engaging jettisoning the vocal sample for a melody that seems to be built from someone quickly waving their hand in front of an air vent theres no lack of fascinating sounds on offer theres a bit less grooviness s raw beat hits and hits again with little variation criticizing its lack of swing though only serves to highlight the quality on hand is clearly a label to keep an eye on
