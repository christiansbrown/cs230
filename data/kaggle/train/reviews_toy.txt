of all the releases that flooded the market last year from cadenza few sounded like the cadenza of old as much as s seventynine suffused with the sort of granular tribal house that lucianos imprint perfected in the mid-00s it hearkened back to the days when cadenza wasnt busy meeting distribution demands for a constant stream of product it seems only right then for the remixers of lokos work to be among some of the heaviest hitters in dance music carl and ricardo villalobos are on hand here each putting their unique stamp on this excellent slab of vinyl is up first and his take is typically epic finding every bit of drama he can muster from the original and stretching to the breaking point its perhaps more understated than some of s more bombastic reversionings due to the mix which puts tribal percussion front and center ut the swirling synths that circle endlessly throughout its length are clearly there to pluck the heartstrings one by one villalobos on the other hand goes epic in a different way finding pleasure as he often does in the suspension of time if youre not a fan of the erlin-based dj/producer this remix will likely have plenty of ammunition for your hatred: chanting children heavenly choir in the background plenty of modular synth wonkiness my advice: sit back relax and enjoy the show thats clearly what the man who made it would want you to do anyway
deepspace also known as aquarium makes dreamy dance music its found a home on labels like natural sciences and silver lake and wouldnt be out of place on mood hut or 1080p most of his tracks have come as aquarium a project that focuses on atmospheric sounds his productions as deepspace are grittier and more floor-focused as seen on last years excellent split ep on natural sciences he now brings deepspace to the hungarian label for the aliass first solo record all four tracks are untitled and have the same drowsy demeanour the chicago-influenced cut is so relaxed that the lo-fi textures feel velvety smooth like a dj seinfeld record with smudged edges the s kick drum stands out as it jostles with squiggly synths while the s throaty bassline is another highlight the is the eps standout with playful call-and-response vocals and perky drum fills this is no-frills house music with moments of brilliance
holmes ives makes a welcome return to with 8 letters featuring the lush vocals of avalon frost remixes from tommyboy round out this package the original starts with simple beats and percussion as it works up into the first part of the mix which includes dirty electro stabs that bounce along nicely with the beat and tribal drum elements more electro melodies are introduced as the vocal comes in and plays along with the beat and complements it well the variety of sounds including the big electro hooks gives this mix depth and groove the vocal is not overused and doesn t try and overtake the production value here quality stuff moving onto the tommyboy remix it immediately hits you with fierce beats subtle synth stabs and rasping percussion giving it a progressive touch the minimal feel of the mix is really noticed when the vocal comes in as it is given the full stage thought not taking anything away from the production (like the original) into the middle of the track a great sustained synth uplifts the track instantly as loads of great sounds play in and out the climax of the track is continually pushed back and climbs as it hits the main breakdown excellent mix all round the tommyboy dub slides a little deeper as it distances itself from the remix simple percussion and deep low synth stabs keep this mix driving through more minimal ground as single elements are continuously added creating a slow build a grainy sample plays over along with quirky sounds and a great reworking of the vocal which is looped up big time the mix doesn t relent in driving home the strong beats but it s the sustained synths that take centre stage again as they are introduced late as good as the remix this is rather a hot package from with all mixes really hitting home in every department tommyboy s remixes are so good i think they have overshadowed the original just cause of the power and listening enjoyment

before they were releasing euphoric mixes of lost disco classics were an alternative queer club night run a foursome of djs w on their fourth compilation for retro minded label james hillard jim stanton luke howard and severino have become an in demand touring outfit started their own imprint for 12 inch re edits and earned a weekly radio show on rinse fm as their profile has risen their mixes have become synonymous with crate digging at its most idealistic n its most basic form aims to recreate the experience of dancing at a club during the peak of disco and the mixes do a good job of translating that aim into a packaged form at their best conveying nostalgia for a gone era alongside the euphoria of discovery their last three releases theyve unearthed such forgotten classics as marcel s reach a one time club mainstay from factory records and gregg diamonds lavishly euphoric this side midnight they successfully create the illusion of a subculture within a subculture through a rougher electro funk influenced sound and selections that plumb the kitschy side of commercial disco this is their most focused mix yet and even though theyre ostensibly working with a finite number of resources the well of obscure disco cuts seems far from dried up here that well includes a dusky afterhours number from singer ( ) and a funky single from legendary boutique label t k ( ) though hmds delivery is mostly the result of astute selections and efficient mixing their force of personality plays a role as well track sequencing alone winks at discos broad thematic gestures ( for instance is mixed into s dont ) and its hard to imagine a more self aware example of polyester clad kitsch than s chintzy which declares devotion to the dj in a voice that sounds like a suburban housewife vacuuming her apartment with martini in hand n there are the angular repetitive harmonies of lets a tart number credited to lamour featuring which sound like a warehouse of preening fembots gether with ura s sweet climactic these cuts do what disco does best: blur the lines between manufactured sexuality and genuine physical and emotional abandon
though hes never released on my favorite robot irish producer brendan gregoriys stock-in-trade synth-laden melodic techno with an electro tint is so well-established that its unlikely to change much whichever label it appears on you could say the same for his quality control: theres a consistency and clarity in gregoriys prolific output that makes it seem effortless hes also unafraid to let a track unfurl in full his 2008 classic ellipsis clocks in at ten minutes and the title track here is almost that length has crescendos and synths similar to those on ellipsis though here its driving force is a dramatic bassline s pin-prick high notes give it the feel of a more stripped-back take on last years excellent moot point a feeling only heightened by the late appearance of a euphoric synth line makes the track this releases highlight on the flip the droplet pads and gentle drums of make it feel meditative by comparison erku s music box aesthetic meanwhile confirms the b-sides relaxed feel and rounds out a characteristically satisfying offering from one of technos class acts
detroit techno complement to the dreamy wide armed take on tech house of parent label traum colognes has spent the better part of the last decade forging a reputation for woollier deep night sounds in a city often associated with fleecy dance creations sporting a rotating roster of close compatriots like alex under n ze and m i a has always been riley reinholds dj treat tagline allowing him to reserve traum for more ethereal homebound tracks following traums marking its 100th vinyl release last year s turn now arrives with a compilation of exclusives and remixes of some of the labels favorite works if we begin in rearview mode though what would a celebration be without triple rs beloved in the christian take on s original is chunkier a bit wider in the arse providing the cuts bizarre cheeky strut a little more bounce to its step while maintaining its sense of play colognes own salz infuses s with blurts of dark color and tone splattering more than strokes of melody around its simple core rhythms elsewhere berlin duo format b leaves the peak alarms and sirens of s 2008 summer jam intact playing head games with its cloaked claustrophobic peak atmospheres dirt crew co owner break s fizzy slow bubblin take on s van dusseldorf was recreated essentially from ground up; the new version focuses on little glints of silver light on a blank lampless night small ringing tones against a cold grind but as with traum 100 last year theres far more to be gleaned from s exclusives than its fond backward glances if celebratory label comps are about cake and ice cream and not staking out possible future vistas puts its party hat on right by calling in its biggie vets for sheer night bliss first and foremost traum stalwart and imaginary forest ranger turns up with beginning with perky tribal rhythms resembling so many of minilogues bases of the last few years slowly filters in another of his stunning thumb whorl melodies while he plays with the tracks serpentine rhythm and buzzing bug zapper stings meanwhile wastes no time getting to s frantic hefty pulse circles its breakneck pace with a sticky trance like melody before allowing the track to dissolve completely all honey fingered effects and bell tones that sound as though theyre emerging from the bottom of a winter creek bed m s brings the demented funk with a cauterized bassline stiff electro grind and strobe effects so dank and cool they almost snarl while returns with the spastic eye twitch workout of its nerves exposed; an anxious paranoid drug pursuit though its one of the compilations most tense excursions and not particularly representative of its functional aesthetic belongs right beside s and s inclusions as cuts that really get s mood for revelry is 100 vinyl releases and almost ten years in now frankly as i said its damn fitting that some of their mainstays were up to the feting
