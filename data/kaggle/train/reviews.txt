of all the releases that flooded the market last year from cadenza few sounded like the cadenza of old as much as s seventynine suffused with the sort of granular tribal house that lucianos imprint perfected in the mid-00s it hearkened back to the days when cadenza wasnt busy meeting distribution demands for a constant stream of product it seems only right then for the remixers of lokos work to be among some of the heaviest hitters in dance music carl and ricardo villalobos are on hand here each putting their unique stamp on this excellent slab of vinyl is up first and his take is typically epic finding every bit of drama he can muster from the original and stretching to the breaking point its perhaps more understated than some of s more bombastic reversionings due to the mix which puts tribal percussion front and center ut the swirling synths that circle endlessly throughout its length are clearly there to pluck the heartstrings one by one villalobos on the other hand goes epic in a different way finding pleasure as he often does in the suspension of time if youre not a fan of the erlin-based dj/producer this remix will likely have plenty of ammunition for your hatred: chanting children heavenly choir in the background plenty of modular synth wonkiness my advice: sit back relax and enjoy the show thats clearly what the man who made it would want you to do anyway
deepspace also known as aquarium makes dreamy dance music its found a home on labels like natural sciences and silver lake and wouldnt be out of place on mood hut or 1080p most of his tracks have come as aquarium a project that focuses on atmospheric sounds his productions as deepspace are grittier and more floor-focused as seen on last years excellent split ep on natural sciences he now brings deepspace to the hungarian label for the aliass first solo record all four tracks are untitled and have the same drowsy demeanour the chicago-influenced cut is so relaxed that the lo-fi textures feel velvety smooth like a dj seinfeld record with smudged edges the s kick drum stands out as it jostles with squiggly synths while the s throaty bassline is another highlight the is the eps standout with playful call-and-response vocals and perky drum fills this is no-frills house music with moments of brilliance
holmes ives makes a welcome return to with 8 letters featuring the lush vocals of avalon frost remixes from tommyboy round out this package the original starts with simple beats and percussion as it works up into the first part of the mix which includes dirty electro stabs that bounce along nicely with the beat and tribal drum elements more electro melodies are introduced as the vocal comes in and plays along with the beat and complements it well the variety of sounds including the big electro hooks gives this mix depth and groove the vocal is not overused and doesn t try and overtake the production value here quality stuff moving onto the tommyboy remix it immediately hits you with fierce beats subtle synth stabs and rasping percussion giving it a progressive touch the minimal feel of the mix is really noticed when the vocal comes in as it is given the full stage thought not taking anything away from the production (like the original) into the middle of the track a great sustained synth uplifts the track instantly as loads of great sounds play in and out the climax of the track is continually pushed back and climbs as it hits the main breakdown excellent mix all round the tommyboy dub slides a little deeper as it distances itself from the remix simple percussion and deep low synth stabs keep this mix driving through more minimal ground as single elements are continuously added creating a slow build a grainy sample plays over along with quirky sounds and a great reworking of the vocal which is looped up big time the mix doesn t relent in driving home the strong beats but it s the sustained synths that take centre stage again as they are introduced late as good as the remix this is rather a hot package from with all mixes really hitting home in every department tommyboy s remixes are so good i think they have overshadowed the original just cause of the power and listening enjoyment

though hes never released on my favorite robot irish producer brendan gregoriys stock-in-trade synth-laden melodic techno with an electro tint is so well-established that its unlikely to change much whichever label it appears on you could say the same for his quality control: theres a consistency and clarity in gregoriys prolific output that makes it seem effortless hes also unafraid to let a track unfurl in full his 2008 classic ellipsis clocks in at ten minutes and the title track here is almost that length has crescendos and synths similar to those on ellipsis though here its driving force is a dramatic bassline s pin-prick high notes give it the feel of a more stripped-back take on last years excellent moot point a feeling only heightened by the late appearance of a euphoric synth line makes the track this releases highlight on the flip the droplet pads and gentle drums of make it feel meditative by comparison erku s music box aesthetic meanwhile confirms the b-sides relaxed feel and rounds out a characteristically satisfying offering from one of technos class acts
detroit techno complement to the dreamy wide armed take on tech house of parent label traum colognes has spent the better part of the last decade forging a reputation for woollier deep night sounds in a city often associated with fleecy dance creations sporting a rotating roster of close compatriots like alex under n ze and m i a has always been riley reinholds dj treat tagline allowing him to reserve traum for more ethereal homebound tracks following traums marking its 100th vinyl release last year s turn now arrives with a compilation of exclusives and remixes of some of the labels favorite works if we begin in rearview mode though what would a celebration be without triple rs beloved in the christian take on s original is chunkier a bit wider in the arse providing the cuts bizarre cheeky strut a little more bounce to its step while maintaining its sense of play colognes own salz infuses s with blurts of dark color and tone splattering more than strokes of melody around its simple core rhythms elsewhere berlin duo format b leaves the peak alarms and sirens of s 2008 summer jam intact playing head games with its cloaked claustrophobic peak atmospheres dirt crew co owner break s fizzy slow bubblin take on s van dusseldorf was recreated essentially from ground up; the new version focuses on little glints of silver light on a blank lampless night small ringing tones against a cold grind but as with traum 100 last year theres far more to be gleaned from s exclusives than its fond backward glances if celebratory label comps are about cake and ice cream and not staking out possible future vistas puts its party hat on right by calling in its biggie vets for sheer night bliss first and foremost traum stalwart and imaginary forest ranger turns up with beginning with perky tribal rhythms resembling so many of minilogues bases of the last few years slowly filters in another of his stunning thumb whorl melodies while he plays with the tracks serpentine rhythm and buzzing bug zapper stings meanwhile wastes no time getting to s frantic hefty pulse circles its breakneck pace with a sticky trance like melody before allowing the track to dissolve completely all honey fingered effects and bell tones that sound as though theyre emerging from the bottom of a winter creek bed m s brings the demented funk with a cauterized bassline stiff electro grind and strobe effects so dank and cool they almost snarl while returns with the spastic eye twitch workout of its nerves exposed; an anxious paranoid drug pursuit though its one of the compilations most tense excursions and not particularly representative of its functional aesthetic belongs right beside s and s inclusions as cuts that really get s mood for revelry is 100 vinyl releases and almost ten years in now frankly as i said its damn fitting that some of their mainstays were up to the feting
greed is a talented producer that dont need any kind of introducion lesley is his vocalist for excellency providing us some great stuff like their strange world or gentle rain in collaboration with blackwatch after a little while is now time to some new music from them this time on with a cover version of the classic from the police in the flip is the great remix from one of the duo of the moment kasey taylor and chris meehan coming first is the original mix showing us the usual stuff from greed the track start with an atmospheric mood almost cinematic feeling introducing lesleys vocals but soon building with some subtle bassline a shaker a solid kick and some melodic lines creating a great mood a sort of a minimal vibe lesley finally bring us her sweet and smooth vocals after the first appearance of lesley are added some big synths and a new kick to give a more intense feeling to the track the track again slows down to hear lesley vocals and after a little break give us some more action till the end in the flip is the remix from kasey taylor and chris meehan a great remix by the way starting the things off with a solid kick and a fat bassline cutting and echo delaying some lesleys vocals adding some twisted percussion to it and then the bassline moves all over the track with the usual drum programming from this duo always in the presence of lesleys vocals cutted up samples the track take a bit slower to let us enjoy the fabulous lesleys vocals on the top of the fat bassline and the great percussion adding all the other elements the track burns your head to the end of it the amazing bassline and drums arrangement from this aussie duo really works on any dancefloor around the world and this is defenitely a more dj friendly version something big in the flip is the greed radio edit too as you can evaluate by the name you will probably find this tune playing in you favourite radio station finally something new from greed providing us a cover version of the classic from the police a great interpretation of this classic and while the original is more for that late night sessions if you flip the record you will find a big atmospheric that will get you high in the middle of the dancefloor from kasey taylor and chris meehan this is with any kind of doubts a well offering from

if knew what was good for them theyd lock marc mart nez nadal aka in a room without an internet connection force him to work on music all day who knows maybe thats what they did in 2008: nadal has been the driving force behind all three of the imprints releases but now that theyre out the secret is too nadal is seriously talented someone that label boss andrew grant calls our little martin buttrich that will soon have records out on rekids buzzin fly rebirth as well nadal works here with a spanish dj the duo come up with yet another winner the key to my ears at least is nadals unusual snare placements offering an occasional counterpoint to the 4/4 plod that worms its way into your head in the foreground with that snare popping up every so often to remind us why weve come amid a mildly infectious riff a smoldering bassline the track avoids the usual ethnic techno traps (and that horn led finale aint bad either ) dutch deep house gr father 2000 takes the most ethnic piece the sampled voice of an old man wraps his lighter upbeat take around it adding a healthy shot of organ its a simple one chord thing that was probably knocked out in less time than it took for his recording program to boot up but it lends itself perfectly to the original highlighting how simple effective these elements are

placing classical instruments into a dance music context is no new phenomenon it was a friendship with musicians at the detroit symphony orchestra that proved an inspiration for strings of life of course and more recently randt rauer frick have blazed a trail across europe with their coruscating live show classically-trained new york trio offer something a little different to their like-minded german counterparts not least a jazzier moodier outlook as well as their instruments trumpet cello and sax use ableton serato decks and effects live as a result you can only imagine the work that goes into their recorded output revels in luxurious plucked stand-up bass and sax/trumpet stabs; underpinned by psycho -style violins and jerky live drum interjections it builds to a relentless mid-tempo house groove breaks down and then revives the bassline again with its broken beat vibe relies more on technology than the predecessor with the sax looping back on itself like a childs round; the nine-minute frederyck wanders down the dubstep path with ghostly table tennis mood percussion delayed guitars trippy cosmic pulses and muted brass its final three minutes are a miasmic swirling treat

the story of s rise has been chronicled often enough in these pages so it seems right to cut right to the tunes on the three of diynamics key producers h o s h and team up on three solid cuts with enjoyable results and h o s h occupy the side with which marries diynamic s pluck house aesthetic with stretched and pulled synth motifs as if heard on the utobahn with vehicles whizzing by it culminates in a rushing crescendo of distended pitches before finishing with a bluesy organ fanfare this one has big tune written all over it h o s h and s is more tiger stripes territory with prominent bass pads syncopated stabs and twinkling piano while s has a more dusky cinematic feel (perhaps in homage to the jim jarmusch film of the same name ) its organic drums and offbeat samples flute flourishes error message blurts make it the duo s most sonically advanced tune if better suited for afterhours than peak time the triology ep strongly affirms yet again what diynamic s top roster is capable of especially in collaboration

to my mind the 12-inch has always been the ideal format for and their sample-heavy excursions into rhythm and noise over the course of an album their ideas can wear a bit thin but the sharp shock of a single or ep is perfect for the kind of intensity they trade in s such the series of testpressing records that released in rough-and-ready 12-inches that carve a niche between punishing noise and dread-filled dance music stands among their best work n ominous rhythmic drone opens kick drum emerges from the thick bed of low-end joined by mucky percussion and finally noise at eye-wateringly high frequencies forming a sickened-sounding groove is even better continuing the rancid approach to jungle that began with the h te project some years ago and was revived on testpressing 001 s collision breakbeat churns dementedly before pausing for a full second and returning with double the force warped synth line enters the mix and the whole thing sounds like jungle rotting from within these tracks are raw-edged and visceral but s attention to narrative drama dynamic range and space makes them hit hard
s stranglehold over freeranges release schedule in early continues apace with this 12-inch of remixes of tracks from his forthcoming album not that were complaining or anything: jacksons taster single for the record was a solid bit of tech house and gives plenty of options for lovebirds sebastian d ring the man behind the project takes things in a groovy direction focusing his attention on a rolling beat that offers up a perfect template for melodious keys tinkling synths and yearning strings to play out over top in typical lovebirds fashion d ring aims for a pleasant mix between hard and soft and hits the mark ack on the -side though things are even better wahoo k georg von dem ussche and dixon take in an equally as cinematic direction but pull even more drama out of the proceedings lazy dubby chords come up and out over a chunky beat for the tracks first few minutes as an insistent riff works its way into the picture ll of this build-up however is discarded when the duo pulls back and starts to do it all over again its a trick that youve heard about 1 431 times before but it works a charm here
since debuted on back in 2009 theres been no shortage of sample-led deep house with a firm grasp of its us roots but while he operates in a crowded field this attention-shy producer consistently sidesteps clich partly its down to technique: s tracks tend to be perfectly imperfect using familiar techniques in quietly characterful ways but mostly its something ineffable an ear for that sample over this one for one particular groove as opposed to its infinitesimally different cousin the workers ep demonstrates that in this regard is only getting better at its centre is a trio of sample-led house tracks each simpler and more exquisite than the last cuts between two loops both of which would make excellent tracks on their own and thats about it; with a beat this sprightly it doesnt need to do anything else the faintly andr s-like meanwhile is about as swoonsome as its title suggests finds the sweet spot between rough-edged kinesis (the distorted thump of its kick drum) and gauzy beauty (those creamy guitar licks) these tracks would make an excellent ep on their own; their three companions are weaker though they do a good job of demonstrating s range s clap-led groove is almost technoid while is a proficient but rather dull chicago-style percussion tool strangely lacking in the crunch and crackle found elsewhere trak is a bit more colourful but with such juicy treats elsewhere on the ep you might not find much cause to come back to it
bj rn sgren johan sturesson and jan svensson are analog hardware enthusiasts who began releasing music as while teenagers in the late 80s three decades later the groups sound hasnt evolved much beyond the ebm acid and techno that first inspired the project seems to celebrate that fact on a grab-bag of new reissued and unreleased productions from the swedish trio the newest of the bunch is a pressure cooker of seesawing synth grooves and nimble 808 sequences sly rhythmic shifts play out underneath rolling bass notes punchy chords and a growing air of malaise all of it conspiring to pull you deeper into the rhythmic trance the plumes of shrill noise swell and dissipate around s motorik churn and their melodic undertones offer as much depth as the spacey textures when it all fades out in the final seconds you get the sense that could have gone another ten minutes without losing its immense power and synthg k were first released by sex tags mania in 2012 and recorded two years prior their sprightly electro holds up impeccably and gives a lighter mood revealing the playful energy that feels inherent in even s rougher tunes closer gat an unheard slow-groover from 2001 is all boomy drum machine and low-slung bass but in the experienced hands of these swedes even austerity takes on a madcap glow

dutch dj san and production partner sebastian moore hook up for this first release of from japanese imprint 19box recordings gets two cuts the main being the original mix holding a tight meld of claps and hypnotic rhythms to first cut a groove smooth chord stabs then begin to control the pace while a delaying synthline gets tweaked ontop providing a mesmerising angle the beat drops out at the break seeing a warpy pianoline taking over while spatial fx enhance the sterodic house vibe that kicks in once more belgiums kobbe teams up with austin leeds on the re-hash and instantly turn it around to something chunky as hell emanating the originals clip-clopety percussion and uplifting chords over a toughened beat added to this is a steady bassline vocals which are added intermittently as are subtle twinkling melodies interchanging and culminating in a build up to re-invigorate the dancefloor
even heard out of context the tracks would give you a good idea about the man behind the moniker their bottomed out shuffling percussion their heat-dizzy synths the almost choral mirage of their samples kieran hebdens work has often had a first-dawn glow whether with post-rock outfit fridge in his early albums as four tet or even in the ghostly pirate radio emissions of s beautiful rewind between 2012 and he released three 12-inches as on his own label text that were ostensibly an attempt to release dance floor material under a different name now hes assembled those 12-inches with other music recorded around the same time and released it all through his bandcamp however familiar you are with these records still feels like a considered release though it maintains hebdens intention to make floor-focussed music theres a fluidity to the album that makes it feel like more than a compilation you can hear it in how the two-step soul of is rearranged with more bruising concrete-block percussion and in the eerie central melody of or in how the opener with its snowy samples and light-footed percussive breaks serves as a soft entry-point likewise the very short lets the album gain speed slowly with a central melody that sounds submerged in warm water for the most part the as-yet-unheard tracks are deftly shaped around the singles to round the compilation into something that works as a single entity all that said it would be worthwhile to simply have all these tracks available in one place much of the material stands with hebdens best output over the last few years with its african percussion and chirpy bird samples is a glorious exercise in weird peak-time stomp while is a distorted carved-up bit of enchanted deep house could have been a coda to 2012s excellent pink with a kosmische synth melody that slowly winds itself around another winter-warm vocal sample though may be the most enticing floor-filler strange snarling noises introduce a beat that recalls paul simons cecilia before several other drum circles clatter around the edges as the bass blurs across the drums the percussive chaos is somehow both sun-lit and hidden in darkness its a stark reminder of how hebden continues to evolve 16 years into his career
maceo plex and gabriel anandas is a house colossus that flexes some impressive muscles wallowing in saturnine organ chords and ethereal synth swells its primary weapon is a string-based doppler effect that threads its way across the track eventually bursting into a twisted breakdown if plex and anandas aim is to trip you out with mind-altering sonics then this slice of brooding house succeeds the remixes dont veer too dramatically from the originals mood north s version sees the detroit producer explore the kind of wobbly analogue house hes brought to releases on phonica and permanent vacation although its upstaged by barnts version which given his recent form isnt a surprise rather like ricardo villalobos or roman fl gel barnts remixes like his monumental restyling of cpis proceso from last year play the long game youll struggle to find elements of the original here but barnt shows a like-minded desire to take you somewhere dark and frozen he fills the track with delayed notes and spitting percussion but what really creates the intimidating atmosphere is an expert use of space and theres lots of it
its good to have back after the challenging experimental electronics of 2016s hyperboreal lp his first solo record since 2011 the italian producer returned to deep techno recent months have given us a one-two punch of nuanced wide-ranging eps: first tecnica for semantica and now the white label for is a nocturnal soundscape thats drum-free but propulsive thanks to its polyrhythmic mixture of ascending synth spirals and restless dubbed-out ambience textures that weve been hearing more often in s output since hyperboreal and are straightforward cuts of shimmering atmospheric techno former weaves acidic curls into a rustling 4/4 thump while the latter with its fleet-footed bounce and vibrant pads feels weightless finds in heads-down mode its the records only dj tool before the zoned-out ambient synth sketch ends the release
aleksi per l s application of colundi tuning has been a minor revelation in electronic music the crystalline sound he summons up has an effect similar to that of a gamelan ensemble or of wind chimes in the breeze: something innately pure yet uncanny there is a chasm of distance between each element in his best songs allowing the ear to focus on gorgeous microtonal melodies even when per l is weaving them over basslines and kicks that might otherwise obscure them per l has released hundreds of colundi-tuned tracks in just a handful of years as he made clear to angus finlayson in 2015 hes enthralled by the systems possibilities the results have breathed life into any mix theyve slotted into: special request opened his fabriclive mix with one and objekt found room for two in 2016s standout kern cd even with similar titles theres no way uk74r1514300 could be mistaken for uk74r1620090 however is not one of per l s strongest it continues his run of releases on which last year rounded up some of the finnish artists prolific bandcamp output on colundi sequence vol 1 but falls short of both that compilation and the high standard per l has set for himself given that largely continues what per l has become known for in his colundi phase great plumes of arpeggios rippling across the surface of consistent techno its hard to put a finger on why this album doesnt captivate in the same way the pristine qualities of his sound remain but are presented in a way that doesnt elevate them and burdened with elements that seem superfluous is a good example of what feels lacking on top of per l s usual blippy template a darker synth rises through the track but only stays for a brief moment seeming strangely bolted on later as a beautiful chiming pattern rises to the top it suggests a new and purposeful development is taking place but the pattern just shimmers awhile and then the track fades s tracks often hint towards what could be without ever reaching a satisfying conclusion its as if dawn is continually on the verge of breaking but something obstructs the view
res a timeless thing in our environment marcus eoin of told the guardian last week in a rare interview in an urban setting you cant really escape being reminded of the current year and music fashions and so on that the reclusive scottish duo makes music off the grid shouldnt come as a great surprise: since their classic 1998 debut music has right children have operated as a closed system making music resembling very little but their own if you were going to level a complaint at the group its that theyve never left the world theyve created for themselves music theyve released since music has right children has been commendable but how many times can you circle a private island ir last full-length 2005s campfire headphase brought some new sounds into the fold but it didnt feel like a departure so much as a sending-off party with guitars and major keys lifting them above the gloom and into the ether where they were heading though was anyones guess as it turns out they werent going anywhere: morrows harvest their latest takes another pass through the ghostly terrain theyve traversed so many times before yes terrifying bird chirps are back and youll have a new list of seemingly random numbers to assign meaning to but if theyre holding fast to the sound that made them legends theyre also making the formula sound brand new this latest dive into the fog drudges up some of the darkest most paranoid and keenly focused music of their career morrows harvest opens with dissonant arpeggios and a heap of fuzz what john carpenter might record if he took a job soundtracking a michael mann film this theme sticks for the albums duration like a steady drizzle that doesnt let up for weeks clouds only part sporadically but when they do we get some of the most unabashedly gorgeous music in s discography has the kind of wandering melody and head-nodding beat weve heard innumerable times from this group but the space they leave in the mix brings clarity to its strange chords and rhythmic nuance driven by a ghostly piano and strings filtered down to little more than a high-frequency scratch provides some rays of sunlight mostly though were left sifting through chilly ambience and tangled drum patterns driven by the lingering sense of some greater meaning all the clues lead to the bleakest stop on the map ( seeds of the dead in russian) where horror-movie strings struggle to stay afloat on an all-encompassing bassy rumble y eventually die out altogether in an impossibly long fade leaving you in the black for an uncomfortable 15 seconds before the track finally reaches its conclusion whats strange though is that for all this foreboding the listener is never dragged down i chalk this up to the pacing: bright spots are woven amidst more ruminative fare providing a sense of narrative thats too often absent in full-lengths these days loaded with recurring motifs and studio trickery morrows harvest makes for an especially cryptic listen even the most careful listener will be left wondering what it all means luckily have laid out a riddle we wont tire of teasing out embedded in a timeless sound unlike any other
throughout a solo career as irishman ian mcdonnell has never produced a track as melodically twisted and hollowed-out as he has shown a light touch with garage (with mixed results) but this ep on killekill is altogether more paranoid is the centerpiece over a staticky kick drum mcdonnell stacks shrill hyperventilating textures the un-quantized progression is predictable but that doesnt make its escalating thrust any less effective lucys remix is more rickety with a droning low-end and a breakdown that wheezes in the atmosphere and and are equally iced-over with stuttering vocal loops that more clearly recall s past output

theres plenty to keep you on your toes in this transglobal shindig from polands much of that is contained in its opening track where mancunian electro producer plays fast and loose with a range of styles the basic framework of may be house music but its dressed in a coat of many musical hues from boogie to funk liquid liquid style post disco to uk bass the extent of s network is confirmed by the appearance of lbourne electro funk revivalist freekwency he takes us back into the dance music primordial soup with a sleazy 110 bpm track with fluid 808 patterns overlaid by a volley of grinding analogue synths head to poznan for the eps final contribution where offer up a more traditional offering they deliver a seething sample laden house jam made up of clanking latin percussion muddy bass and cosmic synths its a invigorating mix of the rough and the smooth
the pairing of londons ruckspin and leeds jack sparrow seems logical enough both wedge frenetic jungle-inspired patterns in dubstep confines but stay traditional enough to be purist favourites in fact they have collaborated before on ruckspins blessings and sparrows dread but with these denizens of deeper dubstep have gone full time together a new project with an entire album on bristol institution tectonic while has a lot of the sounds you would expect from the duo quaking basslines fidgety percussion its not even close to a hyperactive dervish rather the duo explore a mutual fascination with dub and jazz crafting a brand of dubstep that feels more like a 140bpm counterpart to goldies timeless than say rufige kru its a detour confirmed right from the start: featuring soulful vocals from is all lush synthesizers and yearning horns a surprisingly smooth concoction underlined by subtle lfo rumbles horns are all over this record tightening its umbilical link to timeless and like that album theyre incorporated seamlessly so that the wandering saxophone of is not gimmicky but simply natural and the sheets of sound that lurk behind the rhythms ( ) only add to its fascinatingly oblique and smoky atmosphere if the idea of horn-heavy dubstep scares you away from what you thought might be a ferocious collection of low-frequency barnstormers the records largely leisurely mood might throw you off just as strongly when the album isnt wafting over exotic climes it resonates with a dubby spirituality reflected in the uplifting demeanor of tracks like taking hints from sparrows uncharacteristically romantic loveless last year and running with its light-footed tendencies the dread characteristics of dubstep here are inverted to become warm reassuring and stirring losing none of its power only moving it to a new dimension for those craving a spot of drum-swept heft however s second half offers some veritable delights with the panicked alarm call of and the duos attractively spirited take on garage with considering sparrows versatility and ruckspins involvement in live music project submotion orchestra maybe the end result of shouldnt be so surprising and its release on tectonic only reaffirms that labels courageous commitment to diversity and growth their take on dubstep is comfortably conservative yet experimental and this particular side project succeeds in its mission to bring out heretofore unseen sides of its members when those members happen to be as talented as jack sparrow and ruckspin its going to be hard for the results to be anything less than satisfying anyway
s productions have always been intricately linked to the sounds of the natural world since his debut in 200 hes made a name for creating tiny techno nocturnes that often break into airy sparse tonal patterns that mimic the sylvan sounds to which hes drawn what a friend once referred to as messiaen-ish natural ambiance noted as a part-time forest ranger eulberg took this affinity so far as to bridge his 2007 album heimische gefilde with spoken word descriptions about birds and samples of birdcalls now for his fourth album crafted over almost a year and third for cologne mainstay traum eulbergs cooperated with the german magazine nabu to dedicate eleven songs to various exotica from plants like the bee orchid to animals like the icelandic cyperine and even natural elements like water lest this lead into too literal a read about the sounds eulbergs created here though its notable that this background means much more to the creator than the listener one need know nothing about these allusions to appreciate as another lush hyper-melodic entry in his catalogue though its always been an element of his sound eulberg strips back the energy and heavy pulse of works like flora fauna or bionik and delves into the choppy idm rhythms and overtly song-oriented craftsmanship of artists like nathan fake jesse somfay and apparat feels like much more of a home-listening experience than anything hes produced to date for example circles within a gorgeous whirlpooling synthesizer melody that wouldnt be out of place on a vangelis record while twinkles and sparks across the kind of twilit bell pattern pantha du prince might create with its hip-hop beat and sputtering samples tauschungs-blume is similarly wistful and withdrawn founded around another choral synthesizer wash for all of these silken moodpieces though its a sequence of tracks near s end that sets the album apart from anything eulbergs produced to date gluhwurmchen which translates as dance of the fireflies lives up to its namesake; elegant tonal patterns flutter in and out of the mix drifting out of hearing just as the tracks central melody pushes into the fore follower begins with stately piano before wind-ticked bells start to clatter around the tracks soft sticky beat; as with much of the albums second-half its pitched somewhere between ambient and down-tempo without declining into rote wallpapering es meanwhile recalls the swift bell peals and jumpy rhythm of 2008s herbarium 12-inch with an interwoven series of patterns that sound almost like ice melting in the spring sun its an inspiring run with enough sharp emotionality and escapist appeal to close in a mood of reverie and contemplation its just a shame that in eulbergs likely to attract mainly those whove been following from the beginning s both his most thoroughly realized full-length to date and one of the best of the year; it deserves to stir a new wave of intrigue in the man

italian producer isnt exactly a newcomer but he hasnt quite broken through to drum basss upper echelons either his latest ep for makes quite a case for him though svelte and sharp these two tracks emphasize his subtler side as easy to enjoy as pieces of sound design as they are club cuts the most distinctive part of sound is its clarity from the opening bar of ones the audio is immaculately chiseled with drum sounds that are more like knives than percussive thuds winding an eatern instrument like twine around its core the track has a sped-up sinogrime vibe complete with an unobtrusive vocal from mc he turns ones just a smidgen towards the dark side a contrast to the beating heart of production plays the same yin-yang game but is more ornate the central chiming sample is offset by muscular drums and a bassline that bubbles up from below tarnishing the polished marble without leaving a scuff its this kind of sonic perfectionism that is building his name on

deals in a level of emotion usually reserved for peaktime trance tunes yet he remains a darling of the techno community admired for his extravagant productions as much as his dj sets reason is his combination of unpretentiousness and honesty st years ideas from pond for instance was approachable in spite of its epic scale hes back just a year later with another record full of ten-minute sagas though it doesnt navigate very far from his past work is full of the beautiful sounds and arresting melodies that mark his best music dundovs secret is simplicity hooks are right out in front and even if his songs sound huge theyre never too dense is a perfect example: its flowing arps carefully morphing sheets of synth and robust rhythm section work together in tandem never tripping over each other way dundov manages and layers these elements is intuitive as if they were turning malleable in the warmth of his hands next track takes these same ideas and slows them down laying them bare and letting them feel out the space around them its as recognizably dundov as his last full-length but altogether moodier and eerier as with dundovs other albums has a simple narrative working up to a climax and letting us back down again rising action is a bit more intense than usual: the bright and brassy synth work on owes more than a little to pink floyd cinching the nautical theme we get a trip to exotic climes with les s which drifts peacefully as dundovs melodic trademarks bubble up like froth in the surf and by the time we reach the closing track were back on dry land three albums into his career dundovs sound is now more familiar than surprising but in its own way that makes its beauty all the more moving
on a label that releases mostly disco-oriented material samuel annands work as sticks out like a sore thumb you might liken it to a lot of the wonky instrumental hip-hop going on across both sides of the pond at the moment but annands funky basslines and stumbling organic breaks give him a groove that distinguishes him from the rest think syclops on mogadon and youre halfway there this remix package deals mainly with the title track from last years of ep with annand providing a dub mix to round things off its a dub version in the traditional sense of the word with a heavy skanking bassline providing the anchor for his deft delay manipulation of the other elements back over on the a-side three different producers attempt to put their stamp on the original version with mixed results dc recordings artist kelpe is first up sculpting the synth riff of the original into a rolling electro-disco slow-bomb loping along on its squelchy groove and building up an intense atmosphere until a jaunty riff comes along about two-thirds of the way through and ruins the energy that has been building throughout fulgeance fares better with his version beefing up the drums and using micro-sampling techniques to restructure the track into his own heavy hip-hop style despite the low tempo its definitely one for a packed dancefloor with its rigid rhythm and cascading bass riffs fellow frenchman d bruits effort sounds pedestrian in comparison and even a few crunk-friendly whoa samples cant save it from being the most forgettable of all the remixes on offer here however stones throw man james contributes a downtempo electro-boogie take on stripping the original back to its see-sawing bass riff and padding it out with looped vocal samples and gently prodding melodic synths its always good to see imprints taking risks and experimenting with new sounds and styles especially when it reaps gems like the versions offered by fulgeance and on this release

the world can be a terrifying place full of pain suffering and evil most of us shy away from that harsh reality margaret chardiet is acutely aware of this and she wants to make us aware of it too the human condition and its dual nature is a longstanding theme of her project on chardiets latest album she asks us to face what it really means to be human in all of its splendour and agony previous albums abandon and bestial burden have touched on issues of the flesh bestial burden portrayed the body as a failing system a rotting vessel and jailer of the mind considers what happens when the mind breaks free s soaring instrumental which whooshes upwards and expand from all sides seems to convey that idea its one of the records few moments of respite the searing production on is one thing whats most rousing though is chardiets voice her banshee cries pierce the soul on opener on her black metal vocals are so shrill that they could shatter glass she always sounds on the edge of a knife prepared to bleed out for her art her lyrics mostly incomprehensible are at the heart of her projects beauty and philosophy but even without discernible words sends a clear and uncomfortable message the album is hostile and debilitating but playing at home still falls short of experiencing live despite chardiets efforts to transpose the energy thats exchanged between audience and performer at her shows chardiets presence on the album is so commanding however that you can almost feel her reaching out to you from beyond the recording itll shake you up no matter what
provides credible support for the argument that great electronic music doesnt just age well but that it should despite the passage of time sound like it was made yesterday indeed in this instance a reissue sounds more dynamic than the majority of contemporary dub techno releases uk producer llen saei k first put out back in as part of a five-record series and it is fitting that he chooses it to mark his return (like that other great uk late 90s producer josh brent saei was absent for five years ) tougher than most of s releases nonetheless feature an underlying hypnotic quality that is a common narrative throughout his work based on a hammering iron-cast rhythm and resonating metallic percussion these elements provide the basis for a wave of layered atmospheric chords that ebb and flow majestically eventually soaring higher and higher to reach a climax remix-wise modern loves pendle drop the tempo but dont hold back on the intensity levels with s chords sucked into a noisy filter thats underpinned by staccato beats and spiky percussion mike meanwhile delivers a clubbier take with insistent doubled up beats retaining the intensity of the original version but without its cavernous chord sequences
it s a mystery why (paul rose) is releasing a lot of his tracks as white labels on the semi-anonymous imprint it s actually a sublabel of rose s hot flush label and if you think about it is really just spelt backwards oh well the releases are proper and show a man clearly on his own path with a clear headed view of his own sound world on his latest 12 continues to work his niche in style bridging idm colour and complexity with tectonic-heaviness and brooding shadows the -side begins boldly hollowing out a deep space with warm dub echoes before crashing in with a driving beat on the fast side for most dubstep still not quite techno crossover like some of the genre s recent tracks but dark and gripping with a fierce low end reminiscent of cyrus that will get your sub-woofer working hard the melodic coda resplendent with bells and oxcutter-esque ambience takes the heat out a little but it s a track still brimming with more than enough dancefloor possibilities eta on the flip-side takes things a little less lightheartedly and instead wends its way somewhat airily through a classic u-ziq/reflex like melodic chain relatively straight up and content with its own tune eta doesn t hide any big surprises or changes and although neatly built and overall pleasing it doesn t quite thrill tidy single nevertheless
heres a good reason to start your own label not because youd like to get paid twice but because youd like to release music thats too bizarre too idiosyncratic or commercially unviable for anybody else to invest in it experimental guitarist and percussionist has done just that s not as if there arent labels keen to release his work touch editions mego and kranky are among them but his label black truffle which has been going for about five or so years is home to some of his most out-there music including a three-album series of collaborations with keiji haino and jim orourke stacte trilogy of lps the first of which was released in 1998 on jerker productions helped define mbarchis expressive guitar playing and was central to shaping the sound he would flesh out on the pivotal 2004 album grapes from estate for his latest stacte record mbarchi uses classic rock as a catalyst looping riffs until they become claustrophobic and foreboding on he takes a shredding blues-rock riff and accompanies it with his own singular guitar playing unleashing editions mego-ish noise thick ribbons of guitar drone and shrill harmonics dont loops a led zeppelin-style riff for eight minutes if it sounds exhausting it is but its also playful and deeply compelling in the context of mbarchis wider catalogue this is an entertaining diversion rather than a vital release but in its own way its rather brilliant too
s second compilation reflects the dubstep diaspora a couple of generations deep results are perhaps inevitably given whats happened in the scene less cohesive than on the first worth weight even considering the originals impressive stylistic sprawl collections subtitle from edge hints at this pinch spoke recently about a sort of detribalisation in british dance music and perhaps thats what is most in evidence here new influences bleed in all over the place take a track like by which is essentially pure house music with a dollop of extra bass for good measure ts fun but far less indicative of a particular place and time than something like pinchs qawwali or s grind thats not an issue in itself of course but it does say something about the way things have mutated and cross bred t is possible to trace the strains though and further the path taken by the likes of pinch and ppleblim each contributing dark skeletal rollers with acres of space between the notes as well as a more a colourful blast in the form of the latters most explicit link between both compilations kowtons remix of falls a little flat perhaps only because of how exciting kowtons collaborations have been over the past couple of years first three notes of the originals lead melody are looped eternally while typically brusque drums swing away underneath without hitting a stride ts always difficult putting a new spin on such a well loved tune but kowtons version feels reticent polished with touches of both producers but lacking the spirit of either straighter smoother beats underpinning many of the tracks here the rawness of and s contributions appear as welcome bookends for them texture seems the greatest concern whether for one minute or 12 both stand out from the rest of the compilation for this reason in particular both by himself and remixed by seems an antidote to the sometimes self conscious genre spotting that one can often fall prey to s nd s is a patient masterpiece taken from the reeling skullways album a free spirited journey that bubbles with ideas without settling on one in particular t 12 minutes its not exactly a microcosm of anything but it does feel somewhat like a realisation of that from edge statement: restless but confident experimental but warm and welcoming s a start to finish listen worth weight vol 2 lacks a common thread beyond s catholic taste and bristol itself t feels less like a collective statement than a snapshot of what a particular group of artists have been up to while dubstep disintegrated around them so where worth weight was an exhaustive overview of an alternate centre of dubstep gravity vol 2 lacks that immediate pivot f there is no centre were all on the edge
laurie is nothing if not a groove scientist: his loops (mainly on and fear of flying) are chunky and irresistibly engaging with each rotation often peppered with a sweaty tribalism and effervescent air of rude-boy cool its almost ghetto house for want of a better epithet but it never bangs so hard that you lose interest or tune out on grounds of inhumanity: theres plenty of charm and personality in these beats as such its hard to pick the four tracks here apart each lands just about fully formed and reaches the same locked-in ends just in slightly different ways whips and snaps like a whippersnapper drags you in with a mutant breathy vocal snippet that never fully reveals itself and boils as various devilish sonic details bounce off in different directions like fat spitting from a frying pan is more introspective but still drives with a sultry and subliminal groove youll find hard not to enjoy
the crews label has been in the works for almost a year now its first release is a 14-track posthumous album initially touted as a various artists compilation it makes sense however you look at it: the bread-and-butter of the footwork crew has always been collaboration and true to form every track on sees the late rashad harden working with his teammates its a beautiful way to start the label looking back at some of the best archival cuts and highlighting the crews talents since hardens death in 2014 posthumous collaborations eps and tributes have trickled out but nothing as comprehensive as its 14 tracks span the footwork timeline from starker early experiments to the smooth soul of the uble cup days tracks like and are banner belters slick funk sharpened into a 160 pm attack augmenting footworks forward thrust with trap-style drum programming there are also tunes that sound much older fukd and are dead simple and based around looped vocal samples the former is especially nasty with a queasy bassline that sounds like it was meant to blow subwoofers it hearkens back to the ghettoteknitianz days when harden and his partner sounded raw and dangerous on the melancholic collab s laid-back weed obsession turns insular and paranoid ut then theres which starts out gruff and threatening before it turns into a horn-led outro can hear the musicality of hardens compositions begin to blossom in moments like these s community is as important to as harden himself s touch is unmistakable on where a vulgar sample is padded by pillowy synths gets a trippy half-time switch courtesy of one of the more dextrous drum programmers in brings out jungle influences on and adds some old-school bounce to s most promising young gun strikes a brilliant chord on e which takes on the beautiful and lush qualities of his work for rainfeeder and luckyme efore s release shared a bonus track that doesnt feature harden machinedrum and microglobes high on hope is bright and synthetic like nylon compared to the albums more rustic textures its also layered and dense with the kind of fleet-footed drum work we expect from machinedrum while it comes from a place that has grown beyond the rashad school of footwork it couldnt exist without his music and his efforts and its inclusion is another example of how prismatic hardens legacy has been is a rare bit of nostalgia from a group that prefers to drive forward y starting their label with a retrospective underline their continued debt to hardens work while also showcasing the artists that are carrying his torch it proves that no matter how far they go everything does is indelibly marked by their departed leader whose genius endures years after we last heard from him
we make hits not the people is the second in a trilogy of physically-released eps by four tracks exploring the innermost mechanisms of electronic music ears grind pistons slam exposed circuity enervates by rerouting electricity into explosive dead ends all that good industrial stuff not unlike raster-notons recent output the fastidiously mechanical music shares certain structural ideas with dubstep however the force with which these beats crash and skid on the warehouse floor packs a determined wallop far greater than even the deepest sub-bass caverns of london as opposed to the unfriendly industrial detritus of preceding ep hello lonely hold the nation hits feels more structured every track carries some sort of vocal melody presumably sampled from any number of pop or r b sources they may be fragmented and occasionally encased in suffocating bulletproof glass but theyre melodies nonetheless dont go about the typical route of dehumanizing androgyny or fashioning the anthemic and triumphant out of snippets but rather use their siren songs to thicken the dread on a disconnected voice tremulously whimpers i feel so cold its too easy too obvious and too effective starts the ep off with subtle sputters synths whirring in the background until the swinging beat finally drops brutal by anyones standards this is painful music probing tendrils of electricity snarl and spark menacingly creeping up the sides the softly cooing vocals exhorting that love is real from somewhere deep within the tracks churning chambers are mocking an ugly approximation of humanity from a hulking mech those electric currents combine with the beats for the startling incertia : think five reese basslines playing at once but just like the previous ep the final track shows the most progress: the potential energy of is such that it sounds like the track is compelled to move a violent thrust that nearly brings it down from within horns murmur in the distance and vocals babble meaningless phrases that ride the same unnatural horizontal trajectory; this mechanical beast isnt even pretending to be human anymore as the track burns itself out consumed by digital distortion flames it becomes a question of whether or not vision is a dystopian reality or a nightmarish hallucination but while their beats are playing the thrilling terror or awe they inspire renders such matters meaningless

for the first release on the shadowy label s 2009 cut naconda gets reworked in the style of tribal guarachero an emergent mexican subgenre that fuses woozily syncopated folk percussion with stomping electronic kicks and claps the label is keeping mum as to the remixers identity and in a sense it hardly makes a difference because its a fair bet that youve never heard anything quite like this before the rhythm is unusually hard to parse at first it drives forward over a straight 4/4 kick drum at 130 pm but rushing conga patterns lend a profoundly offbeat sensibility and a much slower one (in fact i wasnt even sure that it was a straight 4/4 kick until i dropped the track into bleton and could see how the beats line up ) its rare in dance music to have top line polyrhythms that tug so powerfully against the regular beat the groove stumbles forward driven and deranged gradually folding in strands of the originals distinctive bleepy melody ut its teased in and out extending guaracheros strange lulls and rushes to the stop start structure of the track as a whole its as thrilling as it is baffling the flip features by the 24 year old ustin texas producer etween the title and that telltale bass whoomp it sounds like an homage to musical mobs grime classic pulse x although he also seems to have picked up an unusually elastic sense of timekeeping from his beat making compadres across the border ells and sampled hand percussion flutter nervously against rigid kicks and a slippery three against four groove shifts incessantly from side to side alternately lumbering and shimmying
typical signifiers of music-nerd cool fly out the window when it comes to balearic music at least the version pioneered by innovators like alfredo cuts like chris reas josephine and laid backs fly away / walking in sunshine are as cheesy as they are beautiful the virtually unknown st louis duo comprising virgil work jr and nicholas georgieff wrote some of the music on their self-titled 12-inch in st louis missouri in 1989 parallel to the second summer of love didnt have ecstasy-addled ibizan vacationers on their minds when they made these four tracks but their sound possesses a telltale b word drift while s music was technically private press that doesnt mean the same thing as with say obscure acid-folk or one-off boogie records works recent music which includes midi covers of auld syng lang and preset-sounding tunes like smooth funk sounds like something a talented out-of-touch older guy would play outside the mall in unearthing the duos late-80s and early-90s material though has struck gold work and georgieff played their rhythms by hand and as opening song gets moving ambitious fills and glassy cowbells dip in and out the mix it sounds like an excited mechanical drum circle music possesses the charming not-quite-finished quality of other obscure synth funk like new world musics intellectual thinking when they explore dub the duo hits on some deeply psychedelic moments appropriately plodding breaks down into a celestial harp solo not far from iasoss headspace its tough to determine whether such wormholes were beginners luck as works later music has an off-putting algorithmic sheen on however they turn a post-industrial city on the mississippi into a mediterranean island paradise

the birthday celebrations for s label have gone off like an icelandic volcano over the last few months pouring their disruptive discharge over clubs in america and across europe and this album accompanies such shenanigans with 11 completely new tracks by grizzled veterans such as and alongside current nurturees like and s background spins a yarn of radio shows numerous imprints and of course productions but most of all a nocturnal heritage of residencies and hosting parties which is very clear in this hour of mayhem which transports the listener tron style through their speaker cones into a cavernous world of raw brick walls smoke machines and scanners populated by sweaty drones whose lord is the almighty kick this might seem a bit of an overblown description for the first few minutes of the album but thats because it takes a little while to get going sure its necessary to hold back (and hold back and hold back ) theres a hope but not a certainty that holding back is just what hes up to while the opening build that leads into the blend of und (with the formers too familiar vocal) catches a locked groove and tries to decide which way to turn ever listened to the first minutes of a set that you were really looking forward to got bored and took a wander and then stopped in an hour later and the legions of hell were in the process of being commanded forth well just as s rubber band tension is stretched to its breaking point youre running back to your mates with a very serious look on your face spluttering about how they have to come right now from there it goes deeper and more syncopated full of muscle bound tech and railroad momentum s warning chimes calm and the mix drops out before the re introduction of a lonely kick giving you a short breath above water and scaring you with the anticipation at the same time the next few minutes are an exercise in pressure loading after which s breaks through with unprecedented quantities of bass hypnotism and pure urgency in the form of a scalp shredding lead line by the time drops youre deep under leaning on the barriers at the front next to some dude with his eyes closed whos circling his arm around in a kind of zen like trance its raw industrialism of the kind that we had been largely deprived of until berghain and ostgut ton came along dissipating into scatty weirdness near the end the house lights flash on terrifyingly then go off again before the bookending vocal (more relevant and less hackneyed this time) burns it out and suddenly youre back in stark reality wondering where the bloody hell youve been for the past half hour anyone can put together a pounding mix but not many people can do it with the kind of measure that does here this album isnt 60 minutes of at a secret warehouse location its a direct translation of the whole depraved experience to your living room whose few shortcomings include the potential to make you blow your entire overdraft on tickets to awakenings for the next five years

s newest release comes from a trio well-known for their preservation of the chicago sound: melvin oliphant k traxx tadd mullinix k james t cotton and dmarc cantu k himself more so than its contemporaries its a record that sounds truly vintage on the -side all three producers come together under the moniker for a gloomy cut driven by grainy yet rubbery bass and electro-tinged bleeps two marry expertly twining through the tracks length like dn and filling one anothers blanks though the bleeps can at first seem strangely placed their stabby interruptions add character and make more sense as time goes on old-school hats snares and toms complete the package super low-pitched vocals are a conceivable downer but theyre soft indistinct and sparse sees cantu sitting out but a similar aesthetic pursued funky bass again jumps in bed with bleeps this time however the higher-pitched sounds can begin to grate with a squeaky shrill quality more problematic is an organ introduced in the second half which fights for space with the other elements and sits uncomfortably until its given room to breathe later on most modern music is too technically polished to be convincingly vintage genuinely sounds like a relic of that time when machine-noise was still a novelty in itself and composition could be judged less harshly
dublins label is fast becoming one of the finest outlets for innovative new grime its debut came from rabit whose double dragon ep suggested the label would in keeping with its name pursue a subzero aesthetic release number two from the london-based suggests that things arent that simple has previously produced a range of styles: this years adder ep for unknown to the unknown explored effervescent funky and languid dancehall alongside grime; the brilliant ariel in collaboration with famous eno was equal parts blunted robots circa 2010 and present day champion reflects his growing focus on grime but it retains the flair for exuberant melodies that defines much of his work the clues in the name: s music like cheap wine is fruity sticky and gratifyingly sweet making for a take on grime not concerned with conflict and hardship so much as boozy good times (even if there is a lurking melancholy to a lot of it) is an archetypal earworm all fluid synth-strings and lightning-fast pentatonic runs as always hes led by melodies and the bold structure has more in common with song-form than grimes typical jackhammer loops and are brisker and twitchier; the latter does the best job of balancing its melodic content against grimes angular funk none are s best work but theyre solid all the same swing s po-faced reworking of switches between ragged 4x4 and oppressive halftime while slackk turns in a pleasingly mournful version of

its been a while since we last heard from amsterdams pieter willems he emerged in 2011 with a run of records for the likes of fourth wave and doc daneekas that slapped a grin on the often dour bass/techno marriage in an overpopulated niche carved out something distinct and in his time away has finessed that sound further the london skip has faded the drums have grown grimier but the funk and melody that lifted those early tracks is sharpened into a body-bending weapon the title tracks the pick elsewhere grainy low-end threatens to drown out the defter touches but s drums and riffs are beautifully balanced; the grit tempers dulcet harp and synth licks as churning hats propel an otherwise loose rhythm its music that makes you want to strut a catwalk its not quite matched elsewhere but proves a dab hand at blending the bruising and effervescent both and are tougher techno cuts their drums stompy and their synths rough-edged but again theres lightness with pads and organ trills fizzing up in the dank atmosphere these tracks would work as well in a smoky cellar as the would on an adriatic boat is the most in tune with willems last appearance stop-start drums twist between post-dubstep flutter and 4/4 thunk while the bass writhes against an ever-changing cast of slippery synths and stabs each rhythmic change-up inspires a smile a finger-snap and a whole lot of a sweat
brought balearic music disco-tinged rock cosmic grooves tropical funk into the 21st century his solo work barrott has homed in on a particularly engaging strain of the sound one that leans retro inspired by the jose padilla tapes sold at markets around ibiza the laid back guitar solos and wind instruments of the early sketches from an material compiled into 2014s stellar album of the same name made for the ideal tropical island soundtrack barrott who now lives in ibiza takes inspiration from an often overlooked side of the island far from the clubs of san antonio and playa den bossa sketches from an prefers the white isles beautiful coastlines rolling hills and remarkable views barrotts first edition highlighted ibizas natural beauty with a mysticism thats marked the island since its early hippie days concerns itself with the rhythms of daily island life tapping into a more relaxed mood that much is obvious from the track titles: dieters theres an everyday almost mundane inspiration here feels like a callback to the first albums opener baby come home but where that one was laced with funky guitar has soothing woodwind passages you can practically feel the morning sea breeze blowing in barrott ruminates on the weather too with its dub-wise rhythm and noodling guitar is as absent-mindedly absorbing a changing sky the mood becomes anxious on which steers into darker climes with eerie horns and field recordings of thunder has an easygoing quality that might come from living on an island many consider to be paradise on passages like the mallet and string section of dieters barrotts sound touches not only on classic balearic but also the lineage of new wave relaxation and private press music thats gotten popular recently barrotts music has much in common with the output of labels like music from memory light in the tic and mood hut in the context of this album the slide guitar he loves so much sounds oddly contemporary in the time since the first sketches barrott landed a thursday evening residency at ibiza restaurant la rre where he soundtracks the sunset it seems like a perfect gig a relaxed atmosphere where he can play whatever records he likes and not worry about making people dance sounds as if it was made by a dj with a deep collection the spacey synths on hint at motifs beyond the white isle while dieters conveys a lived-in sort of exotica rather than an imaginary one suffers only from familiarity its a sequel through and through reprising ideas themes and sounds from its predecessor albeit with a different energy its a welcome reprise though and those who loved barrotts first album will find themselves transported back to his richly textured intensely coloured natural world all over again
following records from nautiluss locked and gingy bordello as well as the new jack compilation turbos technofication continues apace this time with remixes of gingy bordellos recent ep the originals were are elemental as the title warehouse-grade tools with a hair-raising air to them and for the most part the remixers stick with the plan locked smoothes the 3-against-4 bass bleats of into a steadier 4/4 pattern and he smothers the live-wire sonics in dank reverb but for the most part he keeps his interventions minimal likewise t jijn sticks with the growling vowel tones of adding distortion and easing off the 16th notes to come up with something considerably stormier than the original the clanging jack track gets two reworks cicerio goes the more obvious route pairing dub techno with melodic organ pads but kevin s mix is more distinctive opening with dusky chords and synthetic seagull cries before stomping into action wreathing tough kicks and stabs in a halo of 32nd-note delay there are echoes of both ricardo villalobos mix of shackletons blood on my hands and sister -era sonic youth as it crests to its sky-rending climax
t only 30 years old mica levi k has worked across more styles of music than most people do in a lifetime her most recent and most visible activities have been as a soundtrack composer for films such as under the skin and jackie the latter helped her develop as a more traditional classical composer this is where the two short pieces solo works for cello and piano played by the classically trained musicians oliver coates and eliza mccarthy that make up this 7-inch come in coates and levi who often collaborate released an album together last year coatess rich smooth tone is well suited to s resonant harmonics and elongated almost-drones which creates poignant movement with just the right amount of romanticism was written for mccarthy with a more angular modernist melodicism and modulating tempo its easier to hear levis signature method of fragment repetition with layered build-ups oth pieces benefit from sections of harmonic complexity recorded in a single take using a dual mic set-up its a nice twist to see works like this pressed on a 7-inch and presented with levis own drawings it feels intimate and relaxed as opposed to the grander scale of most classical music this single feels like a peek behind an institutional curtain provided by warm and friendly spirits that understand both sides of the divide
as you might expect s latest ep is a fairly mysterious little package its a remix compilation but the listener has no way of knowing what exactly is being remixed; none of the originals have ever been released and none will be included on the dettmanns upcoming album each track is as cryptically titled as ever and two are remixed by wincent a swiss producer who makes his debut appearance on this ep then of course theres the music itself: stark pounding and relatively emotionless calling nothing to mind besides strobe-lit dance floors its all quite standard for but satisfying nonetheless especially for fans of no-frills techno the first two tracks of are done by norman dettmanns longtime friend and frequent collaborator much like mdr 05 this ep shows to be a master of dark interludes: in terms of sound construction his tracks are very strong but at just over five minutes each and consisting of little more than exceptionally vivid drums these tunes work best as a bridge is the more charismatic of the two with funky hi-hat patterns and weird psychedelic underpinnings while is more of a peak time dj tool nothing too memorable but good for keeping a heavy vibe going on the b-side wincent gooses a bit more color into dettmanns austere arrangements is a deep and breezy techno track with layers of strings strewn across a rugged bassline revealing a production style that despite lacking s audiophile appeal is more emotional and easily engrossing takes a dryer approach pairing a galloping techno beat with a simple dubby synth part like s latter remix its a nice dj tool but holds little value outside of the club
its nigh on impossible to write a review of a en klock record without talking about erghain of which he is a resident dj s with his fellow resident (and sometime collaborator) marcel dettmann klocks music is driving minimal techno thats specifically tailored to make full use of the spaces cavernous acoustics and this release doesnt really divert from that particular ethic in contrast to dettmann however klock is more generous in his use of melody to give the metallic rhythmic chassis a bit of colour on he combines a warm chiming bassline (thats strangely reminiscent of lex smokes mix of junior oys) with a cold yet funky bass melody to give the track an almost jaunty feel s the track progresses the warmth gets stripped away and the rhythmic elements are brought to the forefront all the time being eqed and pitch shifted to tease the dancers into action t a time where a lot of minimal techno seems to be geared towards tool-based material its refreshing to see someone put out a track which ends on a totally different mood compared to how it started on the flipside is much more simplistic which ends up being to its detriment gain its immaculately produced but the pattern of triplets that forms the main melody is so sterile that no amount of percussive tweaking can save it from falling into mediocrity theres no doubt that when hes on form klock is capable of producing engaging and cerebral material that is also aware of what works on the floor but unfortunately this twelve falls short of the standard that hes set on all of his releases for ostgut ton so far
has gleefully swerved off the beaten track with this new ep a russian duo arent much bothered with functionality and formulas does contain dance music tropes like acid lines breaks and steady kick drums but they arent the records guiding influence or defining feature dance music is a source of energy rather than a set of constraints is exacting not a detail is out of place the position of each sound is specific the title track is wild techno but the connections between its sounds are exceptionally precise bell tolls heralding a sudden swoosh of noise which knocks into a synth before exploding into a choked sparkle but in the moment this is all just an evocative burst of colour s such these tracks never sound laborious or overworked despite the rave indicators in tracks like the crisp abstract sound design found elsewhere on the ep calls to mind the high-impact style of experimental grime theres some humour too places lion roars on top of a hushed voice saying something about beasts while pril had me thinking theyd sampled lil wayne but some of the most striking moments are the records quietest is the eps opener but it pairs delicate pads and goofy synth tones with such beauty that it remained in mind six tracks later
the split 12 catalogue of hamburg s is swelling with interesting combinations and this one is no exception coupling fine grained with harder sounds from french newcomer has set up an odd contrast sees (persona trenton lan) continuing to refine his eclectic style of context overlap the clip cloppy syncopation and strange melodies blend into an angular organic whole that with the latin inflections wouldn t be out of place on cadenza; though unfolds with layered textures that are trademark like his recent malto ep this track comes into its own in the funky powerful live sets tonni puts heart and soul into the flip side is a debut from paris based who sometimes organises parties at the floating boat club atofar his previous recording history includes an appearance on a slab of hard techno and an unpublished myspace track that encroaches on dubstep territory is loaded with the heavy bass spacey vocals and sci fi samples that dark morning slots are primed for the tracks complement each other in a backhand way with rolling bass unfurling along divergent percussive directions but s gets points for delicacy and depth
for a lot of downbeat deep house acts its simply a matter of a chord sequence and a tempo voila contemplative dance music ut while juju jordash generally occupy this similar space their music has proven over the past few years to be something else entirely culminating recently with the release of their excellent self-titled 2x12-inch the boys return here quickly with another slab of wax on madrids imprint izaack menshenfroind and ilya ziblat shay in tow while the duo helped juju jordash lay down the basis for the two tracks on offer the sound is most definitely their own: everything seems to be swathed in delay and huge molasses mountains of reverb its cloudy listening ideal for a spliff and a wander in the woods ut before you go off and do just that remember that this is also house music j js beats keep things from falling off the cliff into simple easy listening caricature in other words you couldnt have one without the other listening to the results why would you want that anyway its a clich but the two really do create sound worlds or more accurately in the case of the -side ecosystems nd in a world governed by a particular type of sound design and the attendant programs that help those with limited imaginations thats reason enough to celebrate
has made a name for themselves through deep but minimal drum bass rollers on labels like frictions shogun udio and kasras imprint critical funky via the almost complete absence of funk the twosome craft functional floor fillers that stretch beyond pure dance floor fodder through the attention to detail and subtle sound manipulations on their newest for critical is an ice-cold but grabbing minimal drum bass roller over a steppy but steady backbeat an oscillating and lively bassline battles for your attention with harder and colder bass stabs its all about the details though as the small fills alterations patterns and nuances keep you searching for a hook until you realize that the groove has long since seized you and the details themselves are the hook the flip side sees dubstep (and more recently funky) wizard ramadanman turn in a drum bass refix of organizer proving his skills are easily transferable between genres and bpms starting off as a minimal bleepy drum bass number things slowly turn more hectic as skippy drum breaks and descending synth loops naturally weave their way into the track culminating in a constrained but energetic junglistic workout over a rumbling sub basically its dubstep meets jungle in a very good way precise and ice cold drum bass that leaves the listener far from cold

while ari goldman might be considered the silent partner in washington d c duo beautiful swimmers as andrew field-pickering garners more attention with his future times label and productions as maxmillion dunbar hes no slouch addition to being one of the heads behind the ridiculously rare boogie and house shop earcave goldman inaugurates his label with this burning 12-inch from whether youre familiar with sevens parkway label or his entry in claremont 56s originals series its obvious he loves early 90s deep house which he unabashedly proclaims on shouting out the likes of house master terry baldwin fast eddie smith chez-n trent and more revels in that era when house paid explicit homage to its disco heritage standout u-4-ria mix is a peak-hour blend of blocky sampling shameless saxophone and anthemic piano ( lonely dancer version plays up the piano and vocal sample; saxapella is self-explanatory ) delves more into deep house with gently reverberating keys and a voice snipped to a single ohh as jazzy chords swirl around it pressure dub pitches up and brightens the blipping keys a subtle twist on the original both sides of sevens record are effective and despite the sentiment of the title offer plenty of pleasure and satisfaction
when eterkin was coming up he used compilations and mix cds as a cheap way exposing himself to as much music as possible with the first in a new series on his label he delivers an unmixed compilation tracks on vinyl it constitutes a quick and cost effective bit crate digging for any dj in tune with eterkins sound eterkins picks encapsulate the best and worst aspects his spiritual deep house aesthetic re is a fine line between subtlety and dull stasis and for me and s gauzy tracks are difficult to love: theyre so ethereal that they just refuse to stick working in similarly spare flotation tank territory s is far more seductive comprising a spindly rhythm a huge slowly mutating ambient pad and a few pulsating bloops its style descends from the same lineage as kraftwerk ole brian eno and gas thats very different from the crisp vocal house s or the jazzy n y from sound destinations (one eterkins side projects) but its this ability to identify a common sonic and emotional quality in such diverse material a kind blissful zen like transcendence that makes eterkin such an intriguing figure to begin with at times eterkins selections are so slight they disappear in the ether but there is a magical quality to the rest selected which if you havent already done so will leave you longing to see dj preferably at daybreak somewhere at that dislocated point when a crowds collective mind becomes open to such gossamer enchantment
is the year that has finally decommissioned his bristling armoury of pseudonyms harmonic 313 troubleman africa hitech (with steve spacek) etc pledging to operate solely under his birth name given the cross-stylistic stew that currently constitutes uk dance music its hard to think of a better time for him to have done so is the second in a trio of eps for warp and as with ghosts before it sees pritchard borrow from footwork hip-hop and jungle to concoct a series of bold party-ready hybrids its an excellent idea on paper but echoing its predecessor the resultant tracks are often less than compelling house-jungle crossbreed is the requisite vocal number though if were making comparisons the rowdy patter feels a little ponderous compared to spikey tees acerbic performance on ghosts highlight manabadman is a southern rap-rave monster its distended halftime beat harried by acrid blasts of rave-spray its smart as transatlantic mongrels go but pretty fatiguing on the ear the title track bears all the trappings of ragga jungle crusty sampled patois digi-sirens flatulent dub bassline but gets stuck in some sort of 150 bpm holding pattern eventually some breakbeats show up but they sit soft-edged and low in the mix as if pritchard forgot to flick off the safety on his akai its not until that we achieve lift-off its metallic hits and gun-cocks recall jam citys post-grime constructs but pritchard plugs the gaps with masterful breakbeat choppage and glutinous rave stabs the result is as the clich goes both highly contemporary and joyously retro fortunately its a banger too

with eprom as its flagship star amsterdams has been slowly moving from dubstep-friendly grime to freeform experimentation with s new ep though its gone right off the deep end lt;3 grunts to life with some unnerving synth creaks before a slovenly hip-hop beat belches its way in t doesnt hold itself together all that well and the cowbell doesnt even pretend like it wants to bother staying in time with the beat after two minutes its just a jumble of sounds like a drunk dude going to town on an mpc he just found in the garbage truth be told its all kind of riveting sounds like its choking a squirrel with a bowling ball as piercingly pitched gasps duel with haphazard kick drums throwing a bone at the listener maps out a discernible melody even if its being barked out in garbled squawks as if to taunt the listener a hip-hop-style snare roll erupts in the middle of the incoherent chaos the sense of humour on display makes it not only bearable but downright hilarious lets some rambunctious hand percussion roll around in a barely contained structure while a demonic voice chants cursed dancehall ts not forgiving its entirely unpredictable and its a whole lot of fun too
greece s steps forward with a moving arrangement of tribal progressive sounds the progressive elements here can be appreciated outside of the genre as santer takes things in a slightly different direction i m loving both sides of this one as it s got a little bit of house a little bit of techno and so much more a anadisis this groovy percussion arrangement has all of the atmosphere and substance that one could wish for in a tribal tune on top we have a strong operatic vocal while down below is the deep dark collection of beats bass and blistering sound the arrangement is straightforward with subtle builds and drops that keep things progressing while holding strong to the overall attitude of this piece aa astra astra is a little more on the house end than it s counterpart anadisis by incorporating a chunky house groove under swells and loops we see instances of nice bongo fills and a gentle background under the delay of hi-hats and crash cymbals the overall flavor of this tune is heavy and hearty commanding activity from a dance floor and listeners worldwide

a very techy flavoured breaks release from is something that usually does not grace these ears of mine however experimenting with new sounds does make the scene interesting this time it s a harder edged sound almost aggressive in a way side a original mix a combination between breakbeats and hard edged rock guitars make up this track along with some sci-fi film-like vocal samples buzzes and whirrs and a synth line that feels like it s come straight out of a dr who episode interesting marriage of sounds however it s a bit lost on my ears and does get a little uninteresting side b alharma remix more of a danceable mix this b-side continues the current trend with breaks releases where they have breaks on one side and 4/4 tech-house on the other if the a-side failed to get the crowd on the floor then this side should inject some energy into their rear ends the guitar sounds are removed and with the exception of the vocal samples so are all the sci-fi buzzes whirrs and synth sounds in favour of a more tribal tech-house feel conga drums and other percussion is added to the mix and this side really should be the a-side real quality
s r s lee smith pointed out in a feature on the site early last year the fate spencer kincy k has been subject to much speculation fter five prolific years accomplished and diverse house and techno productions on labels like relief cajual heartbeat peacefrog and classic kincey became disillusioned with the business briefly moving from chicago to san franciscos bay rea before reappearing in his hometown without any equipment allegedly not acting like his usual self and having to rely on begging to get by chicago journalist terry matthew recently posted an intriguing couple articles that indicated that he was still alive and in illinois albeit allegedly trying to sue both the fbi and the us department of defense amongst other parties but even if this is true kincy shows no sign returning to the music business any time soon ll that fans can do is enjoy the legacy that he has left either through picking up his releases second-hand or via re-releases such as this one on carl craigs imprint of was kincys sole release on the label and has become a fairly sought after item even though the original issue was pressed rather quietly fans will therefore be pleased to hear that the reissue on s classics series has been remastered and sounds crisper than ever making it much easier to mix the four included cuts with more contemporary releases the two versions that grace this 12-inch are the strongest the bunch; the originals paranoid bleeps powerful kick and militaristic snare patterns coming together to create a tense jacker while the remix stretches things out for a slightly deeper and padded out techno jam the chirpy one-note stabs and slightly more rigid beats dont really have the necessary dynamism to make it a successful dance floor killer but kincy again comes correct on the title track utilising a simple bumping backbeat and frenetic affected hi-hat fills for a real heads-down vibe that should get more clued up members the crowd lost in the groove what with his disappearance from the music scene its a shame that further reissues seem unlikely to resurface but provides a good starting point for house and techno newcomers looking to delve into s strong back catalogue
you could probably guess what s debut album sounds like without ever hearing it thats not a bad thing it speaks to both the surprising solidity of the manchester artists style and the general ubiquity of this sort of eyes-down funereal fare but last years with ep managed to stick out like a throbbing thumb amidst all the soft focus dreck and accomplishes the same trick in his first album-length effort isnt a drastic turnaround nor even that great of a leap forward but it is a whole lot more persuasive mirroring label mate balam acabs turn from monaural to full-splendour stereo with his own lp last year picks up right where with left off: liquid tides splash against a steady pulse that aligns well with k house but feels more like a heartbeat than a dance track that comforting blinker is at the heart of s unusually warm and enveloping sound a 4/4 beat that embraces rather than pierces with blanketing basslines that only add to the womblike shroud whats different this time around is the rest of the textures; he prefers the bevelled shine of 90s adult contemporary sad face electronic music that uses the palette of overwrought power ballads ( impouring ) instead of merely hinting at it theres a staggered and creaky quality to the way he builds his tracks sounds like its struggling with every chord a vocal melody that trips over itself despite its inherent simplicity is an even more vocal-heavy record than his earlier work but these ciphers are almost entirely devoid of language wisely steers clear of the beyond-clich d r b appropriation by stretching out gasps and syllables into unnatural filmy shapes like the slow-motion implosions of and especially the strangely piercing vocals of which unspool in pure agony chipmunk squeak is replaced with searing anguish over a bed of sounds folding in on themselves a crawling rhythm that feels like its hitting a backwards stroke with every pace the tension is released with the bookending which further uncoils the tracks samples into an outpouring of resigned sadness despite all the hints at depression is a strangely uplifting record deed its almost too easy to become completely enamoured with the very sounds its employing rather than the mood its ostensibly trying to convey thats made even better by the increased attention to song structure songs that open up slowly instead of merely repeating patterns lead single has a patient but rewarding climax stumbles around skittish malfunctioning percussion and the title track dissolves into the albums most gut-wrenching moment a simple naked piano breakdown its an uncharacteristic moment of clarity on an album that seems composed entirely of floating clouds a hint that theres another dimension to outside of his already familiar world that said where hes left us on is mighty impressive in itself
one man who is certainly in a bit of form lately is and his latest two tracker on looks set to be yet another solid release for this quality producer is first up and it is a pretty nice track with a good driving flow from the word go i must confess i have heard better from but nevertheless this is quite a nice track but perhaps not as good oas you would expect alkanshel is again in the class of the a-side nice but not fantastic the tempo is certainly lifted as this track is in the peak time progressive field and i feel that on its own it lacks a bit of direction it really needs to fit into a late night set to work
whether sampling jazz and disco producing on old synths or playing other peoples records house and techno have always been genres that consume history the trick is to turn those influences into something new and special as a dj has a grasp on this turning heads with his record collection for the past few years onsidering the hype around him theres a lot at stake on the berlin natives first release but the airmetique ep is an impressive debut acts as a handy lead into the main event its warm and languid smooth enough for a sunny day party but no less intricate on repeat listens silky 2-step bomb is the reason why airmetique has been so hotly anticipated at a time when 90s garage records have been regaining traction and a wealth of limp new garage tunes have tried and failed to replicate them stands out as a throwback of rare subtlety this is revivalism done right: stripped back thoughtfully arranged aware of its history but pushing towards something new isherwood rounds out the ep remixing unreleased track theres a dusty awkwardness to the mancunians drums that recalls stl at his weirdest nonetheless its immediately identifiable as his work no small feat for a producer with one full release to his name its a well-executed tool that in the right hands could be part of a memorable after-hours trip
although it gets underway with a daring jungle vibe and a customary drum break is a laid back affair as a result the track is a far cry from much of babiczs 808-centric techno a string section and a staggered female vocal trade blows for the tracks eight minutes while a subtle but commanding synth loop resounds from start to finish at the halfway point the vocals take centre stage ultimately creating more clutter than babicz may have intended nevertheless the final half complete with a more prominent string section and xylophone touch outshines the first the combination of spacey strings and percussion that fails to jump out of the box renders the track as a handy 7:00 am backroom tool but not much else while certainly no return to 2008s droning dark flower and dont look back stands as a solid effort from the steadfast producer remix-wise gui once again finds himself in control of a babicz cut this time choosing to remove most of the originals string and vocal attachment shu-ri-kan brings the digital lounge vibe opting to inject some keys and cut up the vocal before wrapping it up with a drifting drum loop and glitch-ridden pad breakdown both remixes remain systematically true to the original and as a result happily succeed in introducing some darkness to a fairly restrained track glimpse wraps things up with a tribal bass heavy rework eliminating the vocals altogether

loop has a peculiar relationship with modern music rguably the most significant development to affect pop music and its the backbone that holds up most forms of dance and electronic music but rarely is the presence of loops publicly displayed or proudly called attention to rather you listen like you watch the repeated background scenery of old cartoons and imagine constant linear development while dance music remains less concerned with protecting this artifice it too feels the need for disguise by continually adding and subtracting elements twisting looped fragments into ever more abstract forms or like ricardo villalobos never repeating the same pattern twice berliner is one artist unashamed of revealing his musics source most obviously on his influential loop finding jazz records album where tiny fragments from sixties blue note lps were looped into increasingly complex yet restrained arrangements similar approach dictated the glitch techno he produced as farben but its not the dancefloor that currently excites him his latest for scape is his follow up on kosmischer pitch on which he treated krautrock in much the same way as lpfj did jazz here there is less direct concept and more spontaneity: recorded in transit before moving to a new studio it thus offers a kind of farewell to an old and familiar system and we can hope the beginning of something new translating as nimal observations is all exposed lazily circling loops nothing so trite as direct organic references are made - throughout were in familiar jelinek territory: warm hazy pads drift among conflicting higher and lower waves of sound all governed by a rarely stated / pulse res little of his earlier glitch rather a finite number of synthetic layers carefully and pleasantly combined krautrock traces make appearances but theyre further abstracted as do snippets of guitar and vibraphone for twirls a wind-chime back and forth around a collection of varied tones sounding like obsolete warning signals and ghostly automated doors ne spins a mildly squealing feedback trail around scattered high pitched waves and subdued rhythmic shudders all grainy and drained us opens to a gentle rainstorm before a simple guitar figure spins by concluding with everything slowly scattering away like reluctant guests leaving a party res also a sense of confused retro-futurism as subotnik-like blips and risset-tones dance between jelineks standard bleached hues s a whole isnt nostalgic for a forgotten utopia but oddly looks both backward and forward perhaps evoking an abandoned space station left to endlessly repeat its lonely now useless functions initially this might seem short on surprises but its very subtlety makes this such a welcoming fulfilling album
its tempting to write off an ep with a title as frivolous as netflix chill but s aus debut is more musically mature than its meme-sourced name suggests its four tracks are impressively diverse: theres late-90s new york hip-hop (like a sped-up dj premier beat) on hard-hitting chord-heavy house in the vein of wk7 on and an intriguing ambient sunrise track pinched by sharp bursts of jungle kassem s remix of doubles down on the originals splashing drum work the other adjustments are minor but they make a big difference he slices a small piece from s vocal ( im not going mad / im not going mad / im not going mad ) and rolls it into a little ball which keeps time on each bar as the beat threatens to run away and are sturdy dj tools but the b-side is where the magic happens
n release around this time of year always commands attention that practically nothing is known about its creator only adds to the intrigue fter the hits that were envision in 2011 and howling the following year all eyes turn on for s silky pads glide their way across brisk claps and a underlay of bass lends the release an air of refined class wispy jazz-lines echo their way across the tender frame making this exactly the type of emotionally-charged house the label has made its own clocking in at 108 bpm is even more serene laying plump rolling 303s over a dense bed of synths think tin man or donato dozzy pitched at -8 s strong as both of these tracks are neither will do half the damage of the title track thanks to lovably infectious synth-line and heavy scene-wide support (many labelled it the track of this years movement festival in detroit and s nar in barcelona) look set to score a successive trio of summer anthems

i had been looking forward to hearing cass new mixology since i heard has dazzling melbourne set in january this year in recent years it has been all too rare for a mix cd to stand out and mark itself not only as being special but also important is one such cd this compilation marks the residency of cass at the respected us west coast club and is the third in the interpretations series (the first two were mixed by recordings founder and club resident jerry bonham) it is also cass first mix cd where he has had total creative control (prologue of last year was a label compilation for fire) over two cds cass takes us on an authentic progressive journey where he is the master of his own landscape this cd is a departure from any we ve heard in recent years the mix is richly textured stylistically eclectic and technically faultless cass moves us forward sure but unlike many progressive cds we are never stuck in some one-note mythical groove where we begin to hope that the journey will end instead our pilot steers us through imaginative sound-scapes infused with the confidence of his programming and mixing skills we are never quite sure what lays around the next bend and cass isn t about to warn us either in other words the journey is invigorating not only for the listener but for the progressive sound itself cass paints a sound-scape; now shimmering now infused with darkness sometimes of epic proportions at other times intimate when the first cd opens with jeff sharel s time condition we sense that something is up we soon realise that nothing stays the same for long 4/4 basslines erode disappear reappear as breaks in the end styles cease to matter since the mix is seamless cd 1 is in turns sophisticated and sexy; its twists and turns invigorate the listener it is quite simply a stunning mix with tracks from gus gus lee burridge bushwacka and mekon among others when cd 2 opens with the symphonic exhilaration of charlie may s aptly named progressive stormer behemoth you think for a moment that we ve strayed into the more traditional 2nd progressive cd territory but you re wrong cass is still the pilot here and he isn t about to take the linear route home instead similar to the first cd but with more intensity we twist and turn through breaks electro/disco sounds techno breaks (always the breaks ) house progressive house bombs and more breaks (excession s spatialize and dark globe s mix of all the freaks) until our journey ends with 16b s the game cass leaves us stunned at the intensity of the journey sometimes dark more often melodic at times playful in the end there is no doubt that we have heard some of the best dance music around brilliantly mixed by one of djing s rising stars
the first release for a new label should aim to leave a lasting impression but i h rt digit ls initial offering might leave you without a solid opinion the thing that s ep does best instead is evoke a video game or sci-fi films action sequence fluid and spacey the title track has a rolling harpsichord atop synthetic sounds that could earn it a comparison to trance if the tempo werent so slow its impossible to imagine that was put together without a visual accompaniment the problem though is that the first thing that comes to mind when listening to it is the video for rank 1s irwave more importantly though is the fact that the track full of echoed bleeps and groggy vibrations sounds incomplete lacking a segment that jumps forth and grabs the listener in either the bedroom or in the club is the saving grace despite sounding like what might happen if liam howlett watched the matrix while sifting through his unused fat of the land -era -sides firth takes a risk here wailing out the techno sirens at its breakdown but it works lasted within concrete warehouse walls it would entice glowsticks toward the heavens nonetheless it doesnt have a hefty amount of cross-over appeal: will probably be stellar for a select few and a bit too interstellar for the rest of us
russell whytes debut album glass swords was all about maximalism big melodies high production values and sprawling prog rock-inspired compositions but then came slasherr which compressed that symphonic scale into a few well-timed drops it took a page out of the mainstream m playbook and it rocks dance floors of all kinds even two years after its release thats more or less how the glaswegian operates on ll that chest-beating guitar excess is squished into explosive blasts of powerful pop and rap held together by cinematic interludes compared to its predecessor is a compact record but it still finds a way to show every side of whyte some m pyrotechnics here a bit of hip-hop there and some hints at the old days for good measure if has one thing in common with glass swords its the qualities it shares with 70s rock albums good portion of these tunes wouldnt make sense outside the lp the way they slot together is what makes them effective it takes two whole songs before we get a kick drum which lands with maybe s most divisive single yet throwing his hip-hop allegiances to the wind centres on a hardstyle kick drum that hits in a frenzy of imploding synths and earth-shaking rattles outdone only by a ludicrously massive second drop s a single its obnoxious but in the context of the lp its a welcome release from the stage-setting of and these little interludes shouldnt be overlooked as mere distractions because they too are jammed with details ends with a sudden strike of chorus pedal-enhanced 80s guitar strumming while the shimmering provides a breather after brings s fire down to a momentary simmer in between capitalizes on his pop potential which lands all over the spectrum: retro wonky styles on the scratchy unhinged barking from anny on ttak chilly cloud rap from rising duo on billowing pop fluff on ream this combination of so many styles offers a more comprehensive portrait of than glass swords did it reflects an artist who drops m anthems and produces tracks for rappers while also making flamboyant air guitar-worthy jams s music has long made a case for how cheese and quality can coexist look no further than to see how nothing on lives up to that track but then an album full of that sound would have been exhausting instead whyte has made an lp that rises and falls gracefully proving that even his brand of everything-all-the-time dance music has room for nuance and subtlety
im slightly ashamed as a dance music lover to say that ive never been to ibiza but with an appreciation how a djs tune selection should reflect mood and setting ill go out on a limb and say that tunes on s would give me a pretty good idea what to expect when i do make pilgrimage tribal rhythms abound but its mostly way sounds are dreamy and s t-edged that suggests sun-hazed afternoons on terrace of course res plenty tracks around that fit description given so far but its way that squillace typically producing straightforwardly but strongly fills template with energy pairing fun with drive thats made se ones so popular drum tracks throb has energy in a large boompty kick drum with shakers and s t marimba chords in background is an interlude breathing space choppy and devoid a straight beat stay with us man encourages a vintage jazz vocal is probably heaviest thing here perhaps suited to a transition towards nighttime seriousness cavorting bassline is more prominent energys upped a notch by syncopated chopping and tension builds in suspended chords which rise and n deflate meanwhile is driven by recognisable cowbells aspiring producers take note; its a hook that makes an an m or ra r mostly makes one: this is again backed by smart hi-hats and polyrhythms driven along by a carnival sounds which drop in and out and evolve rolling along to ei r lift a party to whoops and cheers in early stages or give it energy to carry through in late late after stages
those only interested in 4/4 beats and a decent bpm may bypass the first half of this ep from classically-trained producers and head for the remixes do so at your peril true only on with its understated 2-step rhythms cosmic synthery and sample from george gershwins summertime does the pace rise to much above above shuffling level but this is electronica with dance floor sensibilities if you were devilish enough you may want to see what happens if you pitched of and beyond +8; itd probably turn both into moody squelchy deep house theyre best left in original form though paying proper respect to the contemporary 80s equipment with which they are (mostly) created the remixes are headed up by george the manmakemusic and hotflush protagonist treating respectfully save for some intriguing re-splicing of the gershwin lyrics and a deep bass hum underpinning it s take on fuses jan hammer drums to chicago-style rhythms and twin peaks swells although its outshone by epoques dual-paced reworking of veering between pitter-patter percussion and low-register ethereal atmospherics finally ben turns on its head and rids it of its worldly goods reconstructing it in a reverb wash of aphex twin-style experimentalism

in the us kentucky is where the midwest crosses over to the south louisville and lexington had small but ardent pockets of ravers in the 90s so it stands to reason that the latter city would produce someone like tommy wilson last year as wilson made a bottom-heavy little ep called dasein that sounded like the work of someone in the corner waiting to make a real move moves closer to that goal mainly because his approach has lightened some the title cut cuts up an ululating female vocal over a driving straight-four kick accented with a skittering percussion loop and patiently surging bass at first s approach to the vocal is subdued while the beat stomps but eventually the track slips into trickier vocal science with male as well as female voices thrown in and all of it feels surprisingly natural even though if you tried singing along youd sound like a weirdo breaks up the beats into something more obviously dubsteppy with cascading pads dabbed on like watercolors crossing the rhythm like slow-motion chic strings before moving the spotlight onto foggy gorgeous percussion overlays its neo-chillout along similar lines to lones dolphin though they dont sound much like one another of is a head-nod in the general direction of la-style timbre-warp and stutter-step smoother than a lot of whats associated with low end theory but inviting anyway operates here as a coda and a good one: light steppers beat relaxed confident keyboard twinkle it keeps its feet on the ground and keeps reaching for the stars
its telling that dj deep doesnt see the need to separate the techno output from the stuff that gives his label house its name the tunneling-under aspect is whats key: how purely can something be itself s second ep for deeps imprint has a fairly definite answer to that one last years ep1 had some house in it but is textbook texture-play techno just listen to the way on and different levels of hissy percussion decay rub up against one other steel on steel in a way thats subtly abrasive but still alluring on things bend even more when the percussion starts turning jagged as if being taken apart piece by piece meanwhile is the sound of a dirty 303 wrestling for its life against someone who wont let it move more than a little bit at a time
debut album from tobias freund under his bias alias makes for a great techno palate cleanser for after warm and fuzzy deep house of steffis yours mine f your idea of a palate cleanser is swallowing sandpaper that is s dominant texture on ever ascetic for freund abandons sequencer technology in favour of an 808 and a mini pops a man whos produced everything from dance floor bombs droning diatribes spiky synth experiments under names like odd machine pink elln and non standard nstitute is happily split down middle by techno material and synth experiments that dont fall o far from sort of kosmische revival uted by names like dylan ettinger or stellar om source album is at its heart consummate home-listening techno detailed and varied enough for even most fickle of attention spans opener builds layer after layer of grey crackle a drum machine raucously fighting its way through wall of burlap while sticks unnerving fubard vocal samples on p of a steampunk hop heading in a more accessible direction and no 1 almost owe something recent uk with ir synth tangents and li drum machine aerobics latter especially making most of space in an o rwise extremely claustrophobic record is eight minutes of unrelenting ultra-rigid kick drums and endlessly repeating vocals (a voice saying skippy at a frenetic clip) and would hold just as much water in a rture chamber as on a dance floor thankfully freund balances out those moments of extremity with tracks of wanderlust beauty like perpetual chime cycle of where repetitive pattern begins feel uncomfortably vicelike by tracks end or synth-drone experiment which wears itself down in intimidating low-frequency hum tracks like that are a big reason why debut bias album feels like a triumph for a man whos spent a career making mostly difficult music t shouldnt come as a surprise we already knew man who made non standard nstitute plays non standards was same responsible for cant fight this feeling after all but it doesnt make it any less of an achievement bias has given ostgut a remarkable album that has its finger in nearly every pie within reach but feels unremittingly focused at same time t recalls thomas fehlmanns gute luft in its joyful appropriation of all sorts of techno trends and ideas in one unified palette but does it with a steely resolve that sucks all transparent sentimentalism out and replaces it with brutal but inspiring functionalism grey never sounded so lustrous

s career-high ep hallucinogen didnt need to be remixed tracks like and gomenasai arrived ready for club play flawless slow jams like ll and offer little creative wiggle room and the l singers voice is too delicate and important an instrument for half-hearted remix practices so the seven tracks on only work when they keep those points in mind leading the package chops and speeds up the vocals of deploying them awkwardly into one of his 808-loaded rhythms its not that he does a bad job with it but the chicago producers distinctively frantic style doesnt fit well with such a dazed chimeric song it feels just a bit off to hear s untouchable voice pitched higher even if its only a step or two mike sveres sparse remix of does better with vocal clips making a breathy loop from twisted syllables and serving it up as the weightless central hook ditto ir 97s percussive ll remix though his way of repeating certain phrases rips them of meaning it seems to miss the point of remixing such a talented singer when her voice is used merely as texture oddly enough one of the best tracks on has almost nothing to do with mc s wild baile funk version of only lifts a short line from the original weaving it intermittently through gruff vocal blasts and a gauntlet of claps sub-busting bass and whooshing fx its a stretch to call the tune a remix but you have to admire the guy for making the space entirely his own sporting takes a more traditional approach on his re-envisioning the song as spectral down-and-dirty trap twist gives s voice a sly and restrained quality and reveals a latent dark energy in the song on his lengthy remix of ll kahn goes down a similar route but keeps to the originals low-slung groove and patient flow even his obvious added touches flexing the low-end sharpening the percussion and giving mc gaika a number of bars to revel in his dancehall patois fit seamlessly into s sultry slow-burn
after nearly 25 years of making music in relative anonymity the swedish trio have steadily made gains in bringing their uncompromising techno sound to a wider audience but as their latest release for demonstrates this doesnt mean its become any friendlier their sound these days is certainly set at a steadier pace than mid-90s bangers such as alice in acidland but the hard-nosed menace theyve spent the last three decades crafting is screwed firmly in place on the lead track on the a-side is rendered glacial not only by its metronomic 108 bpm crawl but also by its icy surfaces and monolithic scale from its basic oscillating bassline to its cold siren every element is big brutish and a little primordial is cut from the same cloth it lurches forward with knotted bleeps and static-coated drums beating out a rhythm that seems to encourage hard labour rather than dancing while i cant imagine many djs playing these slow and forbidding tracks there is plenty to enjoy in their hypnotic analogue passages uses the same materials but its considerably groovier than its a-side counterparts its strobing acid stabs are twinned with large flat synth notes and not a lot else in keeping with s spartan set-up lastly sets itself into motion with a call-and-respond-style sequence of acid lines and bleeps which within the terms of this ep makes it the records de facto party track
is one of the most intriguing prospects in ristols new wave of producers pushing an unclassifiable sound characterized more by careful polish and easygoing smoothness of course that also means his music can occasionally fall under a beige hue but its a tendency his recent run of productions seems to be moving away from his second release for ristol-based indeed shows him with a foot in a new direction and one stuck in the vanilla past in is bass music soft-rock supreme gliding along effortlessly on a bassline that reveals itself to be a rather hard-edged guitar riff with all the corners sanded down the track rumbles and buzzes like mad in its ravenous determination percolating over a cloud of whirring dub techno chords and earnest percussion ut s taut no-bullshit songwriting makes it: every element feels muscular and sinewy in the perfect place at the perfect time and to hear it all executed in one fell swoop is exhilarating its an uncompromising focus that the -side lacks stretching out over eleven minutes spits out a gangly acid riff that accumulates more dirt and debris as it writhes for the tracks duration but placed on top of the tracks workmanlike house thump and lifeless dub chords the result is disappointingly pedestrian ll the more reason to put in on one more time

new yorks luca venezia aka may have retired his long-running drop lime project recently but the obsession with bass that characterised that alias clearly remains title track fuses a siren-like synth blast with thwacking drums and heavy subs before introducing a note of ethereality through wafting pads ritons remix of is characteristically unsubtle and joyful it has militaristic drums and claps ominous-but-euphoric bass and a sparkling synth riff which make for an irresistible big-room-friendly whole goes even harder than the title track its defiantly pounding kick the jumping-off point for synth and percussion digressions s languid ten minutes of steady bass and flickering key stabs makes for a relaxed close to an impressive collection
eight mnths later im wlkn again veronica lauren tweeted in june the harlem resident had been stuck in the hospital after complications from a debilitating spine issue left her bedridden and barely functioning my spine is partially separated she told paper my pituitary gland is fucked during her long and painful ordeal lauren a classically trained pianist and budding producer feared the worst but planned for the best and is a result of that planning this collection of delicate beat work and rich foggy ambience was created during periods of recovery but you dont need to know the musics backstory to enjoy its simple and striking pleasures after s self-released 2013 album this second solo outing finds lauren refining her palette of basic digital synth tones and punchy hip-hop beats but even with the added finesse each arrangement is draped in a thin veil of prickly distortion tracks like the sing-songy and the stuttering recall shlohmos early standouts albeit with a more pronounced sense of melody bookending the ep and are symphonic and largely beatless their light fluttering harmonies like transposed phrases from richard d james album or the tender side of with love its actually surprising just how many ideas are crammed into these tracks the hallmarks of everything from modern classical and drone to grime and r b given how pared down they are with time back on her side and a companion ep on the way lauren seems to have only started exploring her potential
onkyo pole efan betke ep pulverized burnt pole r pole
is the third release on the fledgling label and their pedigree certainly wont be damaged by this has produced a 12-inch that continues both the development of her own style and marks changes in european house in general these tracks take minimals restraint and penchant for a slowly unfolding groove and marry them to raw analogue textures and real vocal narratives giving it up swirls around one of her trademark 808 drum patterns all angled high hats and claves on the offbeat full vocal phrases gradually coalesce out of echoes a tale of compromise in a voice that must surely be one of the most recognisable on modern dancefloors this track will reward djs and dancers who like a bit of emotional resonance in their sets the nine minute running time is entirely justified by the graceful arc of its construction with the gradual shifts in emphasis always holding your attention the ed remix feels slightly stilted in comparison though still good it doesnt really add anything to the original apart from a slight codeine haze the b side continues with an eroded bass groove overlaid with more tales of love each vocal snippet looped overdubbed and repeated until they form one wondrous whole im glad that this 12-inch has been released into such a receptive deep house hungry climate where it is likely to be widely played this is far from just throwing a piano on a track for the sake of a trend however: this is truly deep and emotional music brought bang up to date but with enough quality to last a long long time
colognes has long been interested in exchange one of her past singles was an appreciation of a church in new york cutting thoughtful house music with a recorded sermon the other centred on the presence of two other artists among them detroit producer whodat detroit often features in kleins exchanges the film editor dj and writer has flown some of the citys key house djs to germany for her ring your ss party and presented a 2012 art exhibition in erlin called new michigan this release for elgiums ever-adventurous label connects the city with another node in kleins global network she works as a facilitator combining whodats beats demurely soulful deepest-of-deep house with the senegalese family diop practitioners of traditional sabar drumming the exchange is two-way on the -side where head-nodding drum loops are interwoven with live percussion that tugs and nudges loosely at the groove the feeling of flux isnt entirely comfortable because of a tense high pedal-note but jazzy chords in the second half soften the mood they might be taking their cues from senegalese writer ndongo samba sylla who sprinkles in a few optimistic statements ( history is full of potential its full of avenues nd we have the capability to choose and to build the avenue we find desirable to take ) on the -side whodats beatmaking steals the show her delicate chord-bassline interplay and wafts of pensive piano make for a detroit house groover of rare vintage the serenity is emphasised by kim sherobbi an educator at a detroit school instructing us to have an open mind knowing that things change all the time sure enough after seven minutes they do: that gentle beat is picked up by the family diop and taken for a leisurely walk

when thinking about house and techno we tend to compartmentalize: house gets the smooth warm and deep stuff and techno gets everything hard and dark perhaps now more than ever dance music acolytes these days understand the intrinsic power of both impulses could there be a better moment for them to join hands belgiums found precedent for such line-blurring in s fingers inc -sampling which first appeared on detroits dow records in 997 and is now back on a highly limited clear-vinyl run on the one hand walter jones composed a fiercely punchy and wildly percussive five-and-a-half minutes of techno that would have no problem keeping pace with anything jeff mills could throw at the floor but laid-back synth pads floating in halftime over all this breakneck banging and an indelibly funky low-end lend the track a vibe more curiously chilled-out than its constituent parts might suggest dj qu whose deep house seems to grow more sinister with every release has undeniably had a hand in making the time ripe for such a (re)marriage his remix of both updates s production technique and refines its moody complexity helping to make this package one of the most widely relevant and wholly enjoyable releases around at the moment
it seemed like everyone in the noise underground made a dance record last year and some of the finest came from the wolf eyes camp of those nate youngs stay sleep (regression vol 2) received a lot of the shine but youngs work with dave shettler in moon pool dead band was equally inventive their first release of finds them as amorphous as ever the title track opens proceedings with a nine-minute tangle of degraded tones and a fairly deranged main melody held together by skronky shuffling drums that while programmed are off-kilter and raw enough to resemble someone tirelessly pounding away on a drum kit recalls severed heads and throbbing gristle (particularly hot on the heels of love ) in its enervated wormy synthlines which are stuck on a similarly anemic halted 4/4 rhythm like those groups they conjure an odd sense of beauty from such withered material as the synths warbling and wavy dance like sunlight on water finally melds bulbous alien chirps with a thrusting house template as eroding noise and rocketing oneohtrix-like juno-60 lines fluctuate underneath the band in the duos name is accurate they resemble a garage band playing dance music with all the mistakes chaos and perfect moments of synchronicity that would entail
three has always been a lucky number and it shows as trafik s third single from their debut album bullet hits all the right buttons the single featuring the vocal assistance of rachel lamb hears new interpretations from k roxx blake potter habersham along with the boys themselves big-room that s how you can best describe the remake as trafik s no retreat no mix fills time and space the emphasis isn t about subtitle textures but hair-raising breakdowns though the vocals lead from time-to-time it has been shown that john elliot and rachel lamb cords can be greatly enhance with delicate song structures than floor filling booty shakers something that still remains though is an enchanting aspect from lamb s performance giving the remix an ethereal touch; it s as if you were listening inside the eye of a storm what we ve heard from k roxx recently is the rock in electronic music nothing new of course but it s always fun to rock out to music that just roxx with the punk roxx mix k roxx goes for a distorted effect; stingy vocals-cuts disjointed that warps elliot s lyrics into myloish territory production is clean and tight allowing enough space for the synths and drum kicks to build a plateau where frequencies clash so they can form once again with the final track blake potter habersham s loslung phunk reprise you get in my opinion the better of the two mixes they have offered to trafik though many will search for the regular mix that was found on jon lisle s os 0_2 the pacing is done right here working with elliot s vocals to introduce the track with ethereal soundscapes potter and habersham takes the listener on a journey they allow space to create itself holding on to the drum kick that will not hear the light of day until it s time; it will be worth it as you anticipate for the melody to rise from below
many hyped derivatives of the electro sound have come and gone but is still standing he s a hard man to pin down releasing under aliases such as silicon scally voice stealer and random factor and his music is equally difficult to categorise ranging from deep emotive numbers such as spectra and evaluation to the aptly titled dark matter this time around finlow s ep is more deep house focused the title track resonates with a deep heavy bassline alongside drowsy atmospherics that almost sedate you by midpoint it s satisfactory stuff with enough space for the track s elements to get to work although it does require a little patience to get there that said if youre a fan of deep electro-tinged house its another one for the bag on the flip uses a more sprightly rhythm getting the snares involved and pushing to the fore spacey cosmic-disco synths but theres also a dour undercurrent to the track which undercuts these more optimistic elements something which could be said for all of the tracks here n introspective cut for those ponderous midweek moments when life just doesnt make sense anymore is definitely the most buoyant of the tracks here and for me it s the standout gain there s that heavy feel a finlow trademark but the cut features beautiful warm arpeggios layered over the huggy low-end; it s a versatile piece of hi-tech funk that would be a welcome add to any deep set get off to a good start with this ep finlow is a versatile producer who is just as at home making floor-friendly house as writing experimental stuff as silicon scally these three cuts are deep and gritty reality checks antithetical to the usual glamour of the genre

considering how colourful his music was early on berlin-based american daniel fisher has taken a turn towards the greyscale in recent years on releases for fifth wall unknown to the unknown and his own allergy season label his approach as has been whittled to a point its sharp enough to fit on spencer parkers a label probably best known for its straightforward club jams on fisher appropriately offers some of his most focused techno yet the ep highlights his gift for working quirky idiosyncrasies into the confines of elementary club music both versions of show as much the original mix with its pulverizing kicks and a warbly piano sample sounds like it could have ended up on l i e s the percussion offers something dynamic to latch onto: slippery hi-hat programming and snares that volley across the measures like an old ben klock track the fried mix keeps the piano and snares but not much else transplanting them into a slower floatier groove thats packed to the brim with hand drums on the b-side is stripped down just some flanged hi-hats and satisfyingly chunky drums a few high-pitched sounds and the hint of a piano are the only meat on the bones closes things out with a left turn: the expanding and contracting basslines and steam-powered hi-hats are both heavier than anything else on powering through the tracks final two minutes a big emotional lead ties a bow on an ep whose straight-up tools still pack a surprise

have called on the services of roman shelepanov under his guise for the second release on their label 2 original productions are on show here and here is how they perform the dark thunderous beats and quirky hats begin what is quite a nice journey that is go it is quite dark and eerie in its first few moments before it enters an interesting breakdown that sees quirky vocal samples and smooth humming pads take control as well as trickling little effects the guts of the production enter again in roaring fashion as the low end sounds go to town once again a solid production here smoother beats and hypnotic pads and effects are the name of the game in voices of light the track continues to take shape from the outset where the hats grow in stature as well as the smooth but subtle strings that ride in the back seat it is a melodic fusion in the breakdown a period where the beauty of the production is showcased it is pretty good throughout however and rounds off a good release not bad at all by both productions have their good points which is pleasing for the label i am sure as well as the buying market as such it s well worth a listen

leonard campbells was originally released as a tape on 1080p last spring and has since become one of the labels definitive releases vinyl reissue on firecracker is well-timed particularly since the vancouver producers profile grew further with the extended mix of sunrise market on the new label pacific rhythm original tape won over fans with its dazed take on laid-back house like recent releases from mood hut its a record that sounds like the city that birthed it: overcast and maritime gloomy and gorgeous in equal measure campbells songs develop and grow with the steady pace of the tides as if his sounds and melodies are being washed ashore firecracker version of drops two of the tapes most distinctive tracks: sunrise market and slam city jam (mix ssist mix) (though in retrospect the slamming breaks and organ chords of that one were slightly out of place anyways) t also changes the order around and adds a new 13-minute closer doing this the scottish label offers a new way to hear the album sounds are homespun and bucolic the rhythms arranged with a plainness that makes them feel as natural as getting up in the morning and sipping a cup of coffee does have its clubbier moments and with its new sequencing it builds as it progresses campbell daubs chords over a garage-inspired beat on the breezy and then goes full dance floor with the driving f the albums imposing techno centrepiece he puts his charming touch on a number of genres you also get walking disco basslines on and spacey retro rave on but no matter what idea hes taking on its always marked by that easy effortlessness feels like it came from a different set of sessions than gruff and rolling with an earthy texture its a major contrast to the seaside aesthetic of the rest of the album but thats hardly a bad thing original sequencing had f at the end letting the tape finish with its most energetic track here m winds it down before opens up a new chapter entirely campbell is a prolific producer: he told juno plus that he tries to create new material for every single show he plays and he already has another release on the way for 1080p the meantime this is a welcome reissue ts an invitation to see this remarkable album in a new light for those who already know it and its new vinyl format should help it earn the attention it deserved the first time around
and drums and plenty of both are pretty much all there is to champion and mel s first collaborative outing the two-track simplistic as that may seem the pair source each component of their sparse productions from a variety of genres a touch of uk funky percussion some dubby echo grimey bassweight a sprinkling of breaks both sides of the record work toward the same ends and with enough idiosyncrasies to keep the producers from repeating themselves if suffers from anything its familiarity it echoes the hardcore revivalism of tessela or special requests 2013 tunes although champion and mel infuse the references with their respective backgrounds makes a heavy stuttering breakbeat its own by filling the gaps with tabla drums snare rolls fx trails and guttural subs; operates like a dismantled grime instrumental rebuilt to simulate the manic throb of champions kool fm remix despite a lack of distinct personality should give any soundsystem a satisfying rattle
i won t be picking a fight with anytime soon that man got crew production wise you ll find him four deep with his c o m a collective buddies: charlie may duncan forbes and barry jamieson hell he even made a record with james holden back in the day ( bloodlock from his airdrawndagger album ) ever keen to lend a hand the c o m a gang have been the men behind the curtain on the majority of the music slapped with the title over the years and i m assuming it must be a lucrative racket too name is as synonymous with dance music as ronaldinho is with football whether a single is good or not so good the cash registers will still chi ching and that s how it rolls with the first couple from s new label : one sits on the good end of the scale and the other well yeah first the single sided is the sound of past reconfigured to work in today s club aesthetic bassline and drums borrow heavily from neo trancers bodzin and schumacher but thrown over the top is all the workings of an epic progressive houser complete with a simple trance melody line with enough hook to land a marlin second release again single sided is less catchy centering around a rising arppegiated bass riff that is repeated ad nauseum from beginning to end bleeps and hisses and seering synths do their best to build momentum but like a schooner bobbing on a windless ocean these sails don t catch the breeze s about three minutes too long and pretty lifeless as an end result
midway through prosumers fabric 79 mix from 2014 the atmosphere takes a sharp left turn what was a summery scene suddenly descends into a pit of eerie electro (i f) and grainy techno ( ) spell is brief two tracks later were in the breezier grips of domus something borrowed but its possibly the mixs most memorable moment i found myself particularly drawn to s re are no rules fear is unknown and sleep is out of question for its adventurous composition it was lifted from the italian producers then unreleased club shock ep which launched his own records earlier this year it was an impressive debut and the follow up depravation has just as much going for it title cut is an idiosyncratic and distorted bit of hardware techno first 90 seconds are rough and blurry with off kilter kicks and sawtoothed stabs before the tempo rapidly slows to a sludgy snail pace with a minute to go the beats regain speed and the track ends up back where it began if that sounds weird its nothing on madteos remix this 13 minute sprawl is an experimental tapestry of warped bass notes analog fuzz and samples from the new york subway drums a bassline and some highs enter during the records mid section but they never hit hard enough to leave a lasting impression s other original cut t s g couldnt be more different its short fast and thumping strapping wicked synths to a frantic bed of kicks claps and blood curdling soundbites were it not for samo + s remix itd be the best track here swedish/chinese pair take a more sedate approach crafting a depraved tech funk roller from a mean bassline horror movie strings and the same eerily poetic spoken sample
s first release on mutual dreaming the label named after her series of parties in new york is also her first ep listening to its four -influenced tracks you hope its the first of many take the deeply funky opener a track that sounds too refined to belong to a debut halals vocal samples and countermelodies are as subtle as the bass and kicks are heavy hitting is relatively sparse with all its elements an urgent snare pattern a lighter kick a spiralling synth melody thrown into sharp relief its spacious and surreal its layers interacting to form a whole greater than the sum of its parts with its three-note synth pad accompanied by little gurgles is a subtle swinging cut were the mix-down a little different with crisper snares and heavier kicks it could be spellbinding but as it stands it feels a little insubstantial compared to the deeper tracks although none of the originals dreaminess is sacrificed terrence s mix has a good deal more heft with eye-watering hi-hats an earworming bassline and wafting snatches of countermelody
looking from the outside in at s third studio album is no simple task given how emphatically different its content and style is from previous releases endtroducing and the private press - both critically acclaimed by musicians and critics alike the latter two albums made a massive mark in the world of trip-hop and revealed the heights that can be scaled when a master of sampling plies his trade yet must be looked at from an alternative perspective and as a stand-alone body of work: it is neither groundbreaking nor likely to shape the next generation of djs and producers the 18-track album is a tough listen at times from the to be skipped forevermore intro track that rambles on for over two minutes to the remix of 3 freaks which closes proceedings has no discernable flow: it s doomed to being played for three or four songs at a time (it does have its ups) rather than listened to in its entirety god bless the person who invented the program function on stereos after the intro this time (im gonna try it my way) kicks off the journey in an inoffensive manner the track uses routine samples it s hardly earth-shattering and its failure to break new musical ground - something shadow has always been famous for - is an appropriate segue for the next slab of music on there has been a lot said about the hyphy sound that shadow unashamedly pushes on this album (hyphy a combination of hyper and fly - is a lifestyle a culture and a music from the streets of oakland) and it is represented for better or worse on 3 freaks turf dancing keep em close dats my part and seein thangs bay area rappers e-40 ( dats my part ) the federation ( turf dancing ) turf talk keak da sneak ( 3 freaks ) and nump ( keep em close ) feature and their oft-aggressive vocals banish shadows production to the backseat of the creative car the oft-maligned single 3 freaks - it has been speculated that turf talk was the major influence on shadow opting to release the track after shadow had initially expressed reservations - is a grower it might sound like trash the first time you hear it but it does get better with each run; yet in the end middle-of-the-road is all that it amounts to damning is the fact that some shadow fans have told resident advisor that hearing 3 freaks on the airwaves has stopped them from listening to - let alone buying in full on turf dancing shadows influence (it is his album i guess) is noticeable in the distance behind the federation and animaniak s screams down the mic but as the lyrics are belted out they take with them a touch of shadows credibility with every line: we dont listen we dont listen we dont listen you dont say some might be tempted to write off the album as a vehicle for rappers and low-profile uk vocalists (read here chris james) but there are some high points: if you don t want to pay homage to the hyphy-nators fast forward to broken levee blues : its hendrix-esque guitar riffs will help to dissolve the bitter aftertaste of the hyphy while backstage girl (featuring phonte coleman) has a narrative that fuses well with the beats and sampling that are not dissimilar to a roots offering elsewhere triplicate takes the album down a notch but would be a welcome addition to any movie soundtrack such is its inherent beauty yet that this track is on the same album as the mr bungle-like frantic and punky opening to artifact only serves to underscore a point: jumps around the musical genres far too much sergio pizzorno and his former kasabian guitarist/keyboardist christopher karloff play their parts in the tiger and it gets the thumbs up this is actually one of the better songs on the album: its indie rock leanings are miles away from the treble of freaks let loose upon the listener earlier on leeds vocalist chris james lends his voice to both erase you - which utilises some familiar shadow drum beats - and made it which has an upbeat rock melody that could easily be mistaken for a coldplay number treat that comparison as you will enuff featuring q-tip and lateef the truth speaker supplies the female vocals on the album and is dreamy enough (did i type dreamy or dreary ) before shadow wraps the album up with more hyphy: dats my part and a remix of 3 freaks end a collaboration that you d never have believed shadow was associated with if it wasnt actually so while no-one can question shadow s guts at showcasing the gangster rap sound he has enjoyed all his life is an average composition at most perhaps davis famous for mashing the samples of others for so long is promoting the many fringe talents here to give something back to the music one thing is for certain: turf talk certainly wasnt arguing when shadow paid his and the other rappers way around europe on a recent tour but money cant buy you love
in the midst of a respectably prolific year tresor resident briefly steps away from his own fachwerk label to kick off clones new asement series imprint the ep features three variations on a potent reduced wall-shaker that first appeared on a split with roman landau last year anyone who missed that tough clean techno gem or the mdrl ep that housed it should take note of clones interest and do a little back-catalog research dehnert doesnt just have a signature style he doggedly pursues a single sonic idea with the detail and care of a specialist with that in mind theres plenty to elevate this collection of alternate versions above the supplemental text category a sturdy new version opens the set submerging the original tracks crisp synths in sudsy pools of delay and replacing the stair-step melody with dazed oscillation where the mdrl version suggested steady incline new version plunges downward another notable difference is the teeter-totter drums that sit high in the mix it seems though that this isnt a new addition but a return to an earlier idea as this tick-tock effect appears on the following first version as well the elevating micro-melody is back sounding much the same as it did on mdrl in fact overall first version cuts quite close to the version of originally pressed the eps third track then is something of a jolt with novel sound head levon vincent called in for remix honors he slows the tempo but basically retains the structure of dehnerts track wild divergences in the sound palette however make all the difference vincent replaces dehnerts bare-bones synths with an invigorating barrage of cheap horns while percussive burps of what sound like treated vocals pop out of the arrangement whack-a-mole style gaudy peculiar and irresistibly funky it variously brings to mind yellos oh yeah eric rakims to the listeners and dj kozes dr fuck and if that doesnt pique your interest i dont even know you anymore
first release for since late last year is a four-track double-vinyl trans-atlantic joint featuring frankfurts sascha dive and s luke hess along with echospaces increasingly busy cv313 project dive and hesss original track merges the dj-friendly drive that the former has been known for with the latters more dubbed-out and understated sensibilities result clearly geared toward uptempo dance floors is meticulously detailed and dramatically sequenced underpinned with a bevy of crackling chords and led by a terse almost trance-y synth riff its maybe a little longer than necessary at nine minutes but its memorable enough that we can hope this isnt just a one-off collaboration across each of the other three sides is a cv313 remix in true echospace style theyre filled with cavernous reverbs and hissing white noise generators taken together the three tracks are too same-y they each measure just over nine minutes long make use of the same slivers of dub chords and seem to follow the exact same expansive progression but if you can look past that each has its charms dub is dry and gritty while the mix with its moody vaporous chords has a soft and cozy vibe reprise is last and my pick of the three remixes with the trademark hiss turned down lower (though still occasionally reaching high into the mix) it seeks out the sort of open spaces that listeners and djs of a deeper persuasion should be happy to explore
atlanta is beginning to sound like a mini-detroit motor city native kai alc has been holding it down there for a while and now a younger generation of warm soulful house producers has cropped up byron aquarius who splits his time between atlanta and birmingham has been issuing warm boogie-style cuts on labels like wild oats and sound signature jay simons must have records has its hq in the city and young producers like fit of body and twins are carving out their own oddball lanes there atlantan artist splits the difference between detroit-style house and a newer wonkier template and tastemakers have been taking note within the last couple years hes issued his idiosyncratic tracks on labels like alc s ndatl how kill peoples potential unlimited and local imprints cgi and harsh riddims ringer is one of the citys brightest young stars and his new release on continues demonstrating as much res not much to : ringer dumped a lilting guitar sample from a getz gilberto record into his mpc and teased it out over a twitchy drum track but the rhythms are enough to set ringer apart while most producers are content to ride a monotonous kick for eight minutes he switches things up every 16 bars working with a drum kit that includes white noise a stutter-step kick and a ride cymbal that crescendos into the beautiful sample his inability to play things straight might make tough on djs but the approach is memorable even the bonus beats version stripped of all melodic content save a steady three-note bassline is full of personality b-side feels like ringers tribute to dance mania full of bedspring percussion and smash-and-grab snare patterns but it maintains a swinging deep groove tunes smooth synth sax and tough melodic bass put it in the realm of vincent floyds dreamy dance mania records
ne astray might be s most ambitious and experimental work date eschewing c fines of a studio envir ment this ep was composed entirely road sometimes moments before gigs case in point is on the to : if troy really did make this while checking maps in ibiza he s most dedicated man in showbiz at times undanceable sounds here are dense layered and atmospheric this is not brash pounding techno music instead it s introspective and abstract free from linear c straints of standard fare frequencies are dec structed and rec structed again in a freeform fashi as meandering indirect explorati s the music is also more twisted and dark than ever acid is a fitting subtitle for opener it s a warped space age mind bender complete with disorientating bleeps metallic snare rolls and messed up vocal overdubs the versi is a little more dance friendly locking in a tight bassline around swirling sounds and sparse vocals be warned though thumping techno it is not on the to meanders al g like a child with his head in clouds this is most playful track ep sporting an arpeggiated melody that dare i say it almost sounds fun on makes sure se shenanigans are quickly nipped in bud by stripping things back and teasing us with little snippets of hookline overall s versi is not as good as original but a bit more driving for dancefloor the c-side is disappointing is a sparse hi-hat heavy morphing acid number which sounds less like a fully realized d e-and-dusted tune than a demo-like exercise in knob twisting back) again is a sparse minimal number with a half finished quality it pierce lays down a decent rhythm and bassline but its like he forgot add a melody klilkut ano r track finds it origins in an ibizan after-hours is a traditi al slow builder with a tribal edge it it never really gets nuts though levelling after initial build the final track is definitely a headph e home listener stripped back b e with a dr ing repetitive kick drum interspersed with random high hats atmospheric noises hand claps and clicks subtle uches of dub and echo are thrown in for effect and later pierce adds a subtly shifting acid line this really does sound like noodlings of a man messing around his lap p lost in recesses of his own altered state ne astray is not easy listening or easily digestible but is not a man who goes for tried and true i ve listened it back fr t more than a few times now and still can t make up my mind how i feel bits and pieces could be useful but youll need be in right mood take it in in e sitting - its heaviness will weigh down and exhaust you this record is far more an artistic experiment than dancefloor fodder although a few of tracks would work quite well in more open-minded dark and messy after-hours envir ments
over the past year has been inducing intrigue and interest for his online soundscapes and video creations from the likes of renowned mo wax designer and trilogy tapes label boss will ankhead to audio futurist ikonika prior to putting out a release by the genre-defying beat maker on her own hum uzz imprint ikonika initially picked up on the artist via a lo-fi music video he had made for girl units shade on the -side to his hum uzz release continues that hazy and tripped-out aesthetic of r footwork and old school 808 echoes comparable in some ways to hype williams productions due to the mix of nostalgic chopped and looped samples with a fuzzy vhs finish carries more purpose and direction than where pitched up and looped female vocals add a fragile surrealism to the haunting angst-ridden footwork drum patterns and ethereal stabs
it seems like the more hyped an artist is the less we actually hear from them thats certainly been the case with ross birchard since he was signed by kanye wests good music and his tnght project exploded his solo output as has dried up though hes had production credits on albums by west pusha t and drake he hasnt released an ep since 2011 whats most striking about is its directness the track trades his synths-on-synths-on-synths style for a lean and spacious take on trap its almost too spacious in fact the gaps of silence between the drums dampen the impact of what should be a massive drop and though it sounds clean and professional theres something hasty about its simplicity with an epic chord progression and orchestral pomp but not enough elbow grease to properly deliver it feels like a watered-down tnght track an average tune in the catalogue of an artist who usually feels like a pioneer a rudimentary edit by gammer jacks up the energy but doesnt do much to improve on the original like a makeover of something from satin panthers breeze programs birchards old proggy excess into cheap-sounding hip-hop synth horns and funky leads pushed forward by swooning drums that hit with a satisfying knock it easily overshadows primarily because it sounds more identifiably like the same goes for its only a two-minute interlude but the bubbly synth lead gestures towards his well-known love for happy hardcore offering a more personal glimpse into his world mohawkes first ep in three years is less a knockout than a stepping stone hinting at new directions and hopefully more new material to come
kudeta records hook up with south american producers hernan serrano and sebastian castro - clan s for a track entitled the original mix has a combination of rolling beats and dark underlying groove that create a sombre mood while various synth stabs mould a nice groove its got some interesting ideas but could do with being developed further as becomes monotonous by midway for the remix paul davis ranj kaler turn out a take that bears little resemblance to the original with a chunked-up mix of steady percussion and vocal that quietly lurks in the background before breaking and coming to the fore a bit more with the aid of more delayed distorted vocals that give it an unique edge a solid release for kudeta with the remix being the more favourable
leave it to a new guy to make one of the most classic-sounding records in a while ny of s shiny tracks so far might have belonged to the legendary cologne label but with his first ep l hilali seems particularly at home gushing with melody and finished off with some serious glow sounds like something from immer s cutting room floor is an ep of regal love songs at heart and is the courting ritual the rolling max cooper-style basslines are the butterflies in your stomach and the little glissandos are hiccups of excitement graceful synth wiggles up and down before blooming into full-on dark side of the moon noodling getting down and dirty is based on a gurgling bassline passionate synth screeches and stiff piano samples it has a tender frame however padded by horns that keep it graceful even at its most tempestuous reprises s melody but its elegiac this time unspooling into a warm glow as it slowly fades into sleep though it might be a bit throwback is a well-rounded ep that massages all the pleasure centres
the very talented unleashes his solid sound once again with this release on the imprint following successful releases with phil k and jacob todd amongst others dryspell is first up and this quality production showcases the diverse nature of damon s work it s crisp and upbeat for the first few moments but as soon as the chunky and irresistibly funky baseline kicks in the track really takes off it flows very nicely thanks to the low end rumbles quirky effects and tripped out percussion tasty and sinister work from mehs on the flip is purely twisted stuff from screeching effects frequent bleeps grinding baselines and smooth pads are all the way of this production which flows somewhat smoothly over a great set of broken beats it is a quality production that defies genre labeling but more importantly is unique and very interesting
the title track from master h s debut album is a sweet little housey number with soaring synth lines and a groovy bassline that has a trademark silicone soul feeling it s easy to see why master h is fast becoming a more regular household name on the house circuit with a history steeped in parisian fashion shows that mental house anthem magic k and a longplayer with rave reviews this tune is aimed straight at the deep house lovers is dripping in french house feelings with a nicely cut-up vocal to boot and a string section that s got dancefloor chicks grinning the flipside of this release is dedicated to up and coming producer mylo responsible for polishing a new version of the recent elton john re-release are you ready for love note to reader: his other tracks feature on the breastfed label (deconstruction of rock roll wolves of miami and paris 400) are worthy of a listen mylo takes the synth patterns and gives them a dirty electronic 80 s vibe whilst keeping that summer vibe intact if you re looking for more of a dancefloor kick either the mylo vocal or dub are going to be more your bag - there s no messing around with building them up they slide straight into sleaze peak time dance floor action courtesy of mylo for sure
a quick google search on doesnt reveal much about the artists anonymous as they wish to remain (although we do know theyre associated with east coast hip-hop group parallel thought whove worked with del the funky homosapien of gorillaz fame among others) it does however unearth a curiously large number of anecdotes from people in various states of disturbance about the eerie recurrence of the time/number in their lives with this phenomenon being the origin of both the bands name and the subversive darkness of this ep similarly alternative is their use of musique concr te as a conceptual standpoint with demolished breaks and real world sounds giving an impression of reality sans visual and arriving somewhere around the gritty desolation of amon tobin or unkles psyence fiction they make a set of artistic objects like a rothko series perhaps that is they each take the same form heavily distorted looped drum breaks drowning in layers of screaming atmospherics but with differences for example has a haunting piano setting the tone whereas the chimes in feel like theyre being rippled by the first winds of a hurricane as a skin-crawling voice whispers just beyond immediate hearing some people might find the lack of variation tedious but theyd be missing the point this is full-on immersion and aside from the laudable agenda of revisiting a key paradigm in the development of electronic music have reminded us just how real said music can sound
next up on the imprint is a release from the duo of gordon carpenter sean mcclellan under the guise of this release sees some delicate atmospheric breaks take main stage and it sees the release of the a-side track that has featured as one of the highlight productions in anthony pappa s balance mix that a-side track is the very lovely reality theory this is as good as atmospheric breaks gets for me with the track featuring some delicate beat patterns delicious smooth string formations and a nice deep smooth baseline that gives the track a very nice groove a good use of effects and swirling sounds from time to time also add an extra appeal to what is already a fantastic production from the us duo blisstered on the flip is slightly more intense then the a-side the drums and hats for the most part are more muffled and intense with percussion playing quite a role in this track there is of course a similar baseline used to the a-side with is nice and driving in many aspects and this accompanies a couple of nice melodic touches a very strong release on and a release for those who like their breaks with melody and atmosphere if you like them tough and dirty then this may not suit your needs otherwise it is a strongly recommended release

imagine a scenario in which the government enlisted the talents of trent reznor (nin) jack white (the white stripes) and squarepusher in an effort to build a weapon that would be relied upon to save the future of mankind the theory behind this sick and twisted experiment would be to make music that is powerful enough to discourage an invasion of looming alien spacecraft after spending years deep beneath the earth s surface the fruits of their efforts would emerge sounding similar to s newest endeavor entitled always outnumbered never outgunned it is very clear after hearing the first few tunes on always outnumbered that has come a very long way since their 1997 mainstream release the fat of the land that launched their success into the stratosphere the mastermind behind the prodigy that is credited for many of the ideas behind this masterpiece is no other than liam howlett the title says it all about the music and band howlett said this is one quote that i will definitely agree with joining forces in the studio are numerous acts and celebrities vocalists such as kool keith twista oasis liam gallagher performed on the 12-track disc which hit stores in september also appearing on the album is film star juliette lewis this appearance comes just prior to lewis debut release from her band juliette the licks the sound which howlett achieved on the album is one that cannot really be classified into one genre obviously the music is deeply rooted in electronic music yet it reaches into industrial hip-hop breakbeat and rock providing a healthy portion of music for any listener s appetite the first single from always outnumbered never outgunned is entitled girls this song features a very strong breakbeat with an even more-powerful bassline and is nicely rounded off with the classic 80 s synthesizer sound that is being popularized amongst the dance genre i suggest running out immediately and getting your copy of always outnumbered never outgunned available on maverick records
theres a wonderful disconnect between the lyrics of s ( the wonderful loneliness of the headphone silence ) and the idea the reality that its remix will be an anthem throughout clubs this summer ut then again a disconnection between form and content is often how great art is formed ers especially rarely tend to care about what the singers are babbling on about the voice is simply another instrument in the mix in run henrik has found an amazing one runs a norwegian-based folk singer whose vocals are delicate seemingly ready to wither away as soon as they emerge from her mouth innervisions label head takes advantage in his edit of s mix drawing out the intro for 90 seconds before dropping the vocal he maintains the languid pacing throughout adding a kick drum here the interlocking synth lines there and then ties it all up with a sedate string-laden breakdown sedate is hardly the word that comes to mind with s edit ombastic where was restrained the jersey producers big-room take increases the tempo by a few pm and builds its crescendos from an already pumping base one side for the early part of the night one side for peak time you can play it all night long nd probably should
classically-trained polymath daniel martin-mccormick is anything but predictable a veteran of the dc hardcore band eyes he has worked on experimental electro projects (mi ami sex worker) and first started making techno for dance-not-dance label 100 silk his output as is murky spaced-out exploratory techno still the brooklyn-based producer remains ambivalent about dance floor functionality and once enthused to anthem magazine about creating music mastered for intimate home-listening not as he put it uk clubs elaborates on that ethos albeit with more hardware than 2012s hive mind first four tracks are tense with jangling reverb often featuring post-punk and early electronic percussion that most club-focused producers might find lightweight while such tracks in their slipperiness and corroded textures are obviously influenced by drone and noise they are also reminiscent in their darkness busyness and melodicism of classic detroit techno with its lissom glittering melody and frozen atmosphere could be an old transmat release s music is often tagged as psychedelic but this is no serene soundtrack for inner flight at their edges these tracks are manic and unsettling excels when its structures are more orthodox led by what sounds like a steel drum riff and bleeps that are splintering in the red gradually layers in the chaos in a way that feels open and light as if s ideas can suddenly breathe meanwhile is a brooding piece of big-room techno with its insistent kick and fathomless angry bass but does he really want to rock these kinds of spaces between those two the cobblestone jazz-ish minimalism of and atmospheric suggest his real talent lies in ambient electronica opens with a female voice whispering unintelligibly and evolves into a dream-state landscape of extraordinary beauty sadness and even sexiness muted beats phase in and out and bubbling synth figures are held at bay as if youre hearing it three floors away in a club like in general it makes you question if only momentarily the ubiquity of linear 4/4 techno

few weeks ago kiran sande asked when was the last time you listened to a cadenza record the whole way through while my answer was a few days ago i get the point the venerated imprint aint what it used to be luckily challengers are rising to the occasion mong the best is valencias whose in house producer ffkt has seen his star rise immeasurably in the past few months on the back of a slate of productions that sound a lot like a direction that ricardo villalobos and could have taken its a testament to arracas already high profile that theyve locked in both artists to this remix package one which houses some of their most straight ahead and satisfying work in ages villalobos comes first taking on s ffkts and pushing the track even further into a menacingly abstract corner where latin vocals dont sound tired liquid synths buoy a tight yet elastic groove and every single moment of its nearly 16 minute length seems absolutely necessary in other words classic villalobos s rework of is more straightforward (its all relative in this case ) unlike villalobos mix where the emphasis seems to shift constantly from percussion to bassline to voice to some weird noise that you cant quite place the key is the unrelenting bassline which is a sisyphean bit of programming in that it climbs every few seconds only to fall all the way back down again plenty of things happen around it but like any great minimal techno track from s past you cant quite shake that hook nor would you want to
s first transmission of is also the first vinyl release for its portefeuille series of compilation eps it features three label newcomers who each turn in a lengthy cut of moody atmospheric techno up first is from ukrainian producer who last year released an impressive four tracker on en klocks klockworks he seeks out more meditative spaces here summoning the sort of windy reverberations and skipping hi hats that should be familiar to fans apparently an italian producer with no other credits to his name dials up the tension with a thick ping ponging synth line sure to stand out in any mix and slow sprouting broken beats are the main elements at work but theres plenty of other hissing swirling sounds to wrap your head around s ten minute track all cleverly arranged percussion and glimmering pads shows the dutch duo continuing to fine tune their long form approach to production following a couple of similar efforts on field records with three different but altogether intriguing approaches to deep techno its a fine first record of the year for
next up on hooj are italian based producers with disc 1 on the a-side of disc one is the original mix the track begins with some solid house beats and a nice rolling baseline as it progresses a twisted effect plays its role as does the subtle vocal line the track maintains a similar flow throughout without taking too many twists and turns not too bad on the b-side is firstly the paul woolford s jack factory remix this has quirkier drum patterns and is very interesting from the word go the twisted melody comes in soon with the vocal sample riding the top of it the production continually builds with the melody changing its sound and the drums gaining a bit of intensity overall it s a very impressive remix from paul secondly on the b-side is the inland knights fast taxi this is a smoother remix than its predecessor taking a more deep house approach it has a smooth piano line and a nice deep baseline there is a some nice twisted sound fx in there which doesn t really take away from the smooth flow of the track disc 2 on the a-side is paul woolford s box workin dub i must say that this outdoes his remix on disc one it comes with a similar beat pattern but the baseline in this production is shit-hot all the elements work really well in this production as subtle samples and fx flow in and out of the track while the baseline and drums continually pound brilliant work yet again for paul for making 2 mixes with a different approach on the flip is firstly dexter s d-funked mix this takes a more 80 s electro approach a very retro drum pattern is accompanied with some nice bleeps while plenty of the vocal is used in this rework the track has quite a simple flow with no real turns and is not too bad an effort secondly on the b-side is this is radio dolphins dub obviously similar to the original with the vocals sparingly used this track makes good use of a nice baseline and solid drums early on the vocals get cut up and echoed with the twisted fx that featured in the original mix not a bad dub however it may not please those that hated the vocal all together not a bad package from the lads at hooj paul woolfard definately turns in some solid mixes have a listen and check out whats on offer but hooj are definately capable of better releases
is a new label from hyperdub and uk house character cooly g that said is not a dubstep label and its not a house label uk funky or otherwise in fact the closest analogue i can think of would be lexander nuts eglo records or trusmes prime numbers but even those comparisons dont seem to encompass merrisa campbells vision of funk music the first release is a split between greensboro north carolina producer rethis and manchesters professes to make music made between 1980 and 1994 and actually makes a convincing case for such a claim the vintage drum machine and flighty synths bite off the same tip as hyetals anthemic phoenix and the starry chimes seem to signal back to the italo disco made through the similarly retro lens of italians do it etter the track sounds like a chromatics tune delivered from its cocaine induced coma with a little warm breath and a thimble of amaretto rethis ngel is a bit rougher around the edges lacking the appealing vhs blur of but making up for it with its choleric textures the antiseptic track exists in a hostile anaerobic cavern its snaky serrated synth fluidly expanding shrinking and contorting every which way while the trebly percussion futilely attempts to rein it all in s the track reaches its midpoint it feels like all the elements are hazardously hopping all over each other like a perpetually moving human pyramid but rethis careful balance means it never gives way
ren schofield has been honing his noise-techno craft for some time now having first turned heads with an lp for spectrum spools back in 2011 but in his music reaches new heights of pithy aggression back in the day jams exuded a sort of slow-burning acid-fried loucheness; these four tracks are bone-dry terse and foulmouthed sharp bursts of obscenity directed at confused dancers this shift was hinted at in last years blastbeat monster saturated and similar boxy percussion and dizzying three-over-four loop patterns appear on which could almost be miami bass were it not for the brain damaging textures racking its surface elsewhere schofield delights in abrupt gestures and compact structuring goes from shrieking claustrophobia to surprisingly sultry loop-techno and back again sounds like an apocalyptic hangar rave captured on an iphone though the breakdown is deceptively well-tooled as with much of his work it feels like schofield is in complete control at all times in spite of his noisy materials glowering beatdown might be the best of the lot but its up against very strong competition

it s funny we all perceive things presented to us by what we have already experienced i think in a lot of ways that clouds our judgement of things before we ve even given them a chance i can sit here and tell you what i think a certain movie is about before i ve seen it because of who the director is or who the lead actor is i can sit here and tell you i already know what a dance compilation will sound like just because of the djs name on the cover artwork i can also tell you that my assumptions can be wrong because i ve pigeon holed those involved as such i actually thought i already knew what by was going to sound like before i had even listened to the first track given that he s one of the forefathers of trance i expected to hear a set of trance tracks but what i heard was so much more to be honest we all judge a book by its cover whatever that cover may be and i shamefully judged to be just another typical trance dj who was releasing another solo effort is one of those djs/producers who is known the world over in some respect he is probably regarded as a trance icon normally when i write a review i ll write a brief summary of the dj s work up to date this time around i ve decided not to do that because i don t feel it s necessary because this cd is who is today not who he was in the past because this cd presents a man who is looking to the future not living in the past because all you need to know about you can learn from these thirteen tracks opens with crush an uplifting yet atmospheric trance track which has a much more mature sound and vocals that are used sparsely yet effectively with time of our lives and like a friend we see a more chilled side of pvd time of our lives is so beautifully layered with violins and subtle piano riffs that it s quite possibly one of the most haunting tracks that i ve heard all year john mcdaid s vocals only add to the soaring texture of this track likewise can be said for like a friend with it s smokey jazz like sound and layered melodies thoroughly enhanced by jan johnston s vocals both tracks are mellow in beat; both are gentle in nature this is definitely not something i was expecting from we re back to the uplifting euphoric side of trance with the title track this is slightly tougher in sound but the melody is very balearic and i can t help but wish i were on a cruiser in sydney harbour during a mild summer s day or at the very least driving around in a convertible and feeling the wind on my face an absolutely gorgeous track to hear and to feel this is followed by nothing but you already known to most trance lovers as it was the first single released rhythmically energetic yet typically melodic in sound this is probably the most poignantly personal track for van dyk the ethereal norwegian vocals translate to i have nothing but i have everything when i have you which is also the dedication to his wife if the truth were known the romantic side in me can t help but gush at such obvious love and devotion a subdued sound is explored with buenaventura with its underlying darkness which is heard through the full bass but overlaid with an upbeat melody in my opinion a nice transitional track that s more progressive in sound with every listen with homage once again an underlying energy can be heard with the soaring bass but its jan johnston s vocals that make this track the almost angelic vocals she adds give this track an euphoric feel but raising it beyond a typical peaktime track in the broody never forget the plush melody helps to create a luxurious atmosphere thereby achieving a haunting quality for some reason this track reminds of old black and white photographs by man ray initially simple yet full of complexities with each revisit pvd explores a new sound with knowledge with its percussive rolling drums the beats are relentless but in a chemical bros/underworld kind of way in fact it s almost tribal in concept with the rap style lyrics giving it a primal feel that s life follows next this particular track has a very progressive trance feel but the driving bass gives it a solid feel that would suit either a trance or tough progressive set once again john mcdaid s distinct vocals only add to the richness of this track the next two tracks connected and spellbound typify the pvd sound with their rolling almost percussive bass and melodic breakdowns with connected the sound is deeper the melody more unique and layered while spellbound is more energetic in rhythm but with a sweeping melody that makes you wish you could fly and further enhanced by jan johnston s vocals we come to a close with kaleidoscope where began with an uplifting beat so it ends the same a soaring melodic track that suits jan johnston s vocals perfectly a fitting end to a truly inspiring collection of tracks from an overall perspective there is not one track that i favour over the other each is brilliant on a singular basis but shine more greatly when heard together i am not a fan of djs releasing artist albums because quite frankly the expectations are so high that once the end result is released the material can sometimes ends up lacklustre it s unfortunate that these djs are so defined by the music they play in their sets that fans expect them to release better tracks in the end while they may have sweated and toiled over tracks that represent them as a person they are not always received with overwhelming acclaim there are also djs who should simply just stick to being a dj but after having listened to i can honestly say that does not fall in either of these categories he may be better known as a dj but he is also equally a musician and producer while he has stuck to what he knows that being trance he has matured and added a certain depth to that sound through the way he has interpreted melody in each track at the same time he s stepped out of his comfort zone and created beautiful chilled ballads such as time of our lives and like a friend not just that he has explored a new sound creating knowledge with its tribal/breaks influenced beats of all the female vocalists he could have used he chose jan johnston with whom he collaborated on a number of tracks on if there is one vocalist that is the voice of the trance generation that voice belongs to jan johnston don t be fooled by cheap imitations everytime i hear her vocals i know i m home i know everything is as it should be and there is no one that can do what she does her vocals are truly suited for trance and while there are those that may mock this association i personally pity your loss of understanding enough said while i know nothing of john mcdaid one thing i do know is that he is certainly a male vocalist to look out for without his lyrical input and vocals on time of our lives it would not be the brilliant piece of music that it is personally i don t care what has released in the past or whose tracks he has previously remixed i don t care that for an angel is one of the most distinguished trance releases ever i m not concerned with what style of trance he plays during his sets what i do care about is what i m listening to at the moment that may sound very singular in thought but if i was to judge everything that i hear by what i have already heard then i would spend most of my time making comparisons between past and present from my point of view i think that s just a waste of time when i could be enjoying what i have now and looking to the future while i am familiar with his previous solo efforts i don t necessarily need to listen to them to know that s signature sound has matured with this in mind is a very forward thinking release by a dj slash producer who has grown as an artist and therefore pushing the trance sound in a future direction the proof is in his music there is so much depth in these tracks whether they are the trance tracks that we know him for or the chilled moments that i didn t expect the melodies are luxurious the beats are sumptuous the vocals by jan johnston are the very thing that could reduce men to tears i can t begin to explain how surprised i was to find myself emotionally moved by and enjoying a set of diverse tracks that i had mistakenly thought would all sound the same as such there are not enough words to express how pleased i am to have been proven wrong from start to finish all i heard was class all i heard was what trance should be about but of late has been lacking for that i have a newfound respect for there will come a time when i hear a trance dj whoever he or she may be that will close their set with time of our lives it may even be himself that s the day that my friends and those surrounding us will find me in a quivering mess in the middle of a crowded dancefloor i can t wait much respect tracklisting: 1 crush 2 time of our lives 3 like a friend 4 5 nothing but you 6 buenaventura 7 homage 8 never forget 9 knowledge 10 that s life 11

continuing on from the original tune more weed is named after the new mc to grace the mic is actually a more accessible tune to get the crowd on the floor mainly due to its beat and let me be one of the first to say that the beat is a wild thing of a beat which has actually seen some revival lately (check out spider cuts by the bassbin twins) its a fun tune and should get the crowd going ooohhh yeah i know that beat
for sheer hedonistic exuberance and the type of body pummeling rhythms that will have you dancing like a loon look no further than cesare marchese in his guise following up one of last years undoubted hedonistic highlights refuse greed on dumb unit marchese has once more journeyed to the heart of darkness and the results are every bit as satisfying comes in three versions and while the original is a wonderful exercise in low end tribal frequencies with the added bonus of a noise that sounds like a mothership lifting off its s interpretation that takes the honours is definitely on a roll at the moment and he continues to effortlessly take up from where his miami sound machine ep on slash left off its one of the best examples of tribal funk ive heard in a long time youve got to be indulgent in the dark arts of the dance floor to swing with such sophistication so cue an interview where proclaims himself to be clean and serene no matter this is primal stuff seuils version suffers in comparison to such an onslaught its not uneventful though and is perhaps the most haunting of the three takes meanwhile lopes along uneventfully only serving to emphasise the power of the title track theres also a welcome digital exclusive from in the shape of edited by that continues the good work started by
n energetic live recording sets the tone for the third release from helena hauffs label a split ep by and the formers puts us in a warehouse in the middle of russian winter the sky turning from black to grey as the next day begins everything sounds cold dark and weird the echoes of ebm industrial punk and rave are wonderfully dissonant the frenetic fuzzy electro of chugs along persistently while with its mysterious screams and voices thumping drums and unsettling atmospheric swells sounds like a lonely walk home after the rave on the flip s psychedelic electro and deadpan vocals are mesmerizing his angsty expressions could slide into clich but placed against layers of gurgling melodic synths they feel meditative hypnotizes with its trippy textures and both and with their tinges of post punk guitar and acid slip in and out of discernible rhythms the latters pitched down voice is a highlight speaking ominously about committing to a crazed lover like the rest of the ep its hard hitting strange and playful
music 4 adults huh its almost on par with intelligent dance music in ill-fated naming sweepstakes i mean i dont know a lot people that want to listen to music for kids but res an equally-as-strong desire in just about everyone to feel like youll never grow too old to enjoy cutting-edge tunes ei r music for adults doesnt have to mean music to put sweatpants on at 6:30 pm when you get home from work and sit down to watch evening news sure s deep house is pleasant enough to invite stink eye from your younger bro r who listens to rusko and nothing but saxophones feature yet each tracks on contains a little something for younguns in audience as well s minimal bassline is funkier than it has any right to be and works itself into a quiet frenzy tinkling piano sampled crowd noise and punchy synths t r which closes things out is most adult thing here plotting its course slowly with help from mayanjas sampled voice its also weakest thing here precisely because it sounds like something my parents might tolerate elsewhere mayanja treats us like adults we want to be: little bit hip a little bit ready to dance a little bit afraid sweatpants
reviewing ed uptons latest album escape-mcp ras patric fallon lamented that the prolific producer usually associated with electro but capable of all sorts of stuff rarely explores more than one style on any given record not so on which ends another busy year for the uk producer the record begins with a straight-up italo disco tune like some of the best tracks is deceptively simple a strobing bassline and some melancholy melodies and built with bold analogue textures is one of the best electro labels going so of course theres some of that here as well is uptons dopplereffekt impression all cold metal and chilly atmospheres while turns the thin metallic textures of classic electro into alien-sounding melodies all pitch-bent and melted the other two tracks put twists on the formula churns slowly and groovily and the jumpy turns it up to 138 bpm with a storming techno kick making one of uptons most diverse records in recent memory
the second in a three-part series of a collaboration between the black dog and members of the psychick warriors of gaia dokument 02 is about as gripping a release as they come its hard not to feel shaken after immersing yourself in it for an hour taking obvious inspiration from the dada art movement from the man ray-inspired cover art of the first to the ambient industrial anti-aesthetics of the second 02 holds a ep fury in its soundscapes its not theoretical per se its physical: a sub bass rumbles ominously un rneath a lot of the album the eply unsettling emotions carried by whats on top are more remarkable though most of the time its bleak and solate me or else its steeped in melancholy the chords at the beginning of or the fractured ribbon of sound that gli s over the second half of there are ep and warm textures that while not exactly comforting youll still want to sink into kunst is a masterful shifting miasma with hints of joy speration and emptiness a faint in cipherable announcer is intermingled throughout like a ticket conductor on a train to nowhere at the end of unbearably searing knife-edge feedback suggests ferocious attack then sometimes like in the pads bliss out as if were being bathed in transcen ntal hyper-consciousness the group have adopted a sample editing style analagous to the scotch art process used by gil j wolman where bands of printed matter were cut and repositioned in layers which means that for an hour of ambience its actually quite busy dokument 02 is not a passive album: its a slow dark torrent that wrenches you along with it
thinking strombooty might be us urban vernacular tenuously linking an italian volcano with a rather fine behind imagine my surprise when i found out that its actually the booty that is possessed by those of a certain clan or family heritage im sure theres a connection somewhere but while ive always been more than a little bit interested in why certain house and techno tunes acquire their names i dont think researching this aspect of the creative process is that rewarding its the beats that count and has turned out some masterful examples on this four track ep itself is characterised by its energy rumbling bass and concave percussion its a synergy that works on your animal instincts to create a dark tribal ambience to slows the tempo and utilises another uncomplicated groove which along with strategically-launched synth stabs serve to launch this deceptively languid track into the stratosphere is sonically positioned between the tracks already discussed employing similar sounds to the first and having a relaxed feel like the second its got a bit of a tranced-out feel when the synths kick in which with the jacking vocal snippets serve to make it stand out finally the tracky digital exclusive again uses some nice soaring stabs to embellish its beats which seem to be pulling the listener in two different directions

next up on mantra vibes offshoot comes an absolute beauty of a release from the studio of scanty88 two tracks of immense class is the way of the productions from richard marshall and it shows why this italian label is currently one of the hottest around on the a-side is rathbone and it begins with a nice crisp kick drum that soon leads into smooth rolling synths while the hi-hats tenderly shake into the track the drums intensify soon enough in and as they do the atmospheric elements of the track increase resulting in the synths gaining in volume violin sounding melodies are introduced midway in leading into the breakdown that slowly fades out into peak time mayhem and back into a beautiful summer sounding breakdown that again loops back into the beats in style quite truly a stunning production not to be outdone the heist on the flip is just as impressive again a nice smooth atmosphere is created early on as the track builds and develops into a stunning theatre of sounds and peaks the breakdown midway leads into the beats coming back into full force creating a brilliant peak time record with beautiful swirling effects and a deep baseline this is a fantastic release plain and simple both tracks are of the highest order and are of peak time material with great soundscapes created by both productions seek this out as it will not disappoint
released on the label run by london-based german dj juergen junker feels like a labour of love across four tracks its creator saarbr cken producer roger reuter aka celebrates his affection for 80s synth music techno and acid treck spins around a squelchy jacking chicago groove joined by a jagged clanging bassline in contrast is a more doleful stripped back affair part zx spectrum game part oxygene -era jean-michel jarre it sounds like it was recorded on one of those early monophonic handheld casio keyboards the most overtly clubby of the quartet l a d is shot through with acid squiggles snaking synth swells and a portentous fucked-up baritone vocal it finally wooshes off into the sky leaving a trail of disco-ish vapours and phuture-flavoured drum patterns gets busy with the reverb spattering synth decaying into nothing 808s nipping at its heels that such worshipping of the past manages to avoid sounding anachronistic is down to s contemporary approach
skreams imprint has been a confusion of straight up poignant and wobbly dubstep over the years with predictably mixed results the sparklers from its discography have often come via its non-dubstep roster; the two autonomic efforts from instra:mental and d ridge and youandewans hotflushy youandme ep the latest release is its biggest curveball yet with you guessed it mixed results is a sun-soaked and sugarcoated debut from rian gibbs aka gunjack allegedly provoked by tragedy and ill health into making real songs the la-born beatsmith has turned his back on the decades worth of brutal technoid dubstep for something lighter the boogie pop sing-along has made for radio written all over it and indeed has frequented radio 1 to rinse its in the same vein as tensnakes anthemic coma cat but somehow hasnt quite got the formula right its more poppy than cheesy and distinctly lacks tensnakes hooky seasoning nonetheless its pleasant and thoroughly listenable without necessarily being clubby jon covexs remix on the other hand is made for the floor stepping up the pm a little and applying the instra:mental voyeur voiceover the original comes through in saccharine flashes diffusing the grumbling acid undertones to make the overall sound more rolling dark house than his usual techno offerings la duo 12th go the other way delivering some soggy us brostep and quite possibly the worst track to (dis)grace to date

the shatter d lose 10-inch unleashed last autumn on diagonal marked a significant turning point for james donadios project to these ears it was the cleveland producers first release to boast a fully synthesized vision from beginning to end now dont get me wrong: previous titles were certainly badass (in particular the rough-hewn psychedelic black lp from 2012) yet they were largely products of a musician still discovering himself because of this they felt more like assemblages of experiments and sketches rather than cohesive statements sued as separate releases on avian subsidiary truncheon cadence part 1 and 2 are further advancements on the unitive synthesis kickstarted by shatter d lose as with their predecessor the pair of 10-inch plates are both more focused and more uncompromising a perfect example of this is the dense and brittle donadio packs three of his go-to tricks ohio synth-punk decay institut f r feinmotorik-style minimalism and afro-futurist percussion into a single multidimensional piece go back only a year and he simply wasnt working with this many layers a similarly evolved sense of blending distinguishes and wherein thudding primitivism is folded into languorous dub techno clipped and reeking of burned metal both sound like deadbeat productions fed through a cheap-ass yorx boombox donadio also continues to thrust groove research to the center of his aesthetic though he has been known to traverse the ambient and abstract (see the crushed interior full-length) little of that exploration informs either parts of truncheon cadence instead were subjected to a radical onslaught of mangled syncopation mechanized shuffles and technoid mesmerism but whats striking is how he retains his love for grating lo-fi textures while at the same time his understanding of beat design only grows more nuanced the result is an irreconcilable tension between force and finesse the components that make up might be coarse and raw yet in donadios nimble hands they unfold along three sublimely patterned planes: the subterranean bass wallop the chorus of pressure-valve gasps and smack dab in the middle a vibrating electro-drone just as telling is here we find donadio wrangling a chaotic tribal stomp into an exquisite loop punctured by backwards-smeared squeals that would sound right at home on the legendary rema-rema 12-inch as with the rest of the truncheon cadence the track is a testament to how punk energy and techno craftsmanship can successfully coexist
music on has been out before but only a lucky few have it a track by oconnor credited to nd was released on cd without a title in 2001 (it was later played at the beginning of silent servants f ct mix in 2012 ) a production by oconnor and veronica vasicka was released in an edition of 30 at a record fair in rooklyn in 2013 oth tunes warrant a wider circulation brings to mind joy divisions digital or any number of late 70s post punk tear ups for that matter with its neurotic reaction to the oppressive dreariness of everyday life it sounds like a mind numbing day job has caused the band to break out in a rash perhaps oconnor chopped up an old live recording it doesnt sound like it was produced in 1993 if it came out in say 1979 it would be considered a classic today its energy is impossible to ignore is textbook latter day downwards a modern echo of early 80s minimalistic machine punk vasickas vocals are equal parts deadpan and longing caught in the classic push and pull between isolation and lust pairing of a serrated yet simple bassline with a pitter patter drum machine recalls suicide with the bass cranked up quiet guitar accents and key changes in the bass add drama but the damage is done by the slinking rhythm and brooding atmosphere
alexkid makes his return to f-communication with another vocal stormer entitled don t hide it as the title suggests this release unleashes three acid house based reworkings two from alexkid himself and one from the master of acid house josh wink on the a-side is the josh wink acid pussy interpretation the track starts nicely enough with some subdued drum patterns and a slight acid hook the vocal kicks in early and sets a soothing groove from the beginning as the track progresses the drums get noticeably more intense as do the acid hooks which gain force soothing pads also help set the smooth tones throughout creating a pretty good result here for josh especially towards the end as it all comes together very nicely on the flip is firstly the alexkid vocal again the acid baselines are ever present as this mix gets going from the word go it doesn t really build like the a-side does but never fear as it is very good from the word go with a very nice flow much like the wink mix however the acid riffs get quite intense towards the end of the production as they go a little wild the alexkid acid dub is very much like the vocal mix minus the vocals of course the arrangement is quite different with the acid hooks gaining in intensity a lot sooner then they do in the vocal mix this mix really is all about the twisted hooks and sounds and the very delicious breakdown midway in that leads back into the beats crashing back in with some force another very sold release for the french crew at f com the josh wink mix is of pretty high quality as usual and the two alexkid mixes are also quite solid
prior to its untimely demise the mnml ssg blog posted a mix by morphosis (aka rabih beaini) that expertly investigated the lines between experimental electronics and corrosive techno the inclusion of s late in the mix raised a fair bit of comment box chatter and no wonder sounding like keith fullerton whitman making sludgy halting house it bridged the gaps especially well as it happens beaini had also grabbed the track for his morphine label as part of the philadelphia duos first vinyl outing while many of the recent noise artists playing with techno take advantage of their naivet excitingly reckless and gritty because its creators dont know or care about the rules one gets the sense that gnarled as these tracks are know exactly what theyre doing on opener for example stray piercing tones cluster around a heavily overdriven beat encrusted in white noise the steady congealment of these jittery tones into an actual groove suggests a keen precision many of their peers lack while the flip is more primal it backs this idea up builds on a shifty overdriven pummel but its synths are similarly knifelike splintering into miniature melodies as the drums rage below and makes for an oddly entrancing conclusion underlaid by a strangulated screech echoing off into the distance it may be s first foray into dj-friendly formats but the tracks on will make for a startling turn in any mix
the ristol-based duo of james ginzburg (perhaps known best recently for his neon-filament collaborations with joker) and paul purgas make a return with this one-off on ahead of an alleged new album sees rejuvenated and reinvigorated a dormant corpse artificially reanimated with sizzling bolts of electricity in fact thats the defining feature of the song is a bit like sticking a fork in an electrical socket and seeing what kind of incantations come pouring out of your frazzled frame in this case the guinea pig is underground resistance vocalist cornelius harris who spouts apocalyptic rhetoric with demonic ferocity echoing and flickering over snarling threads of digital distortion that bleed through stuttering drum hits until the static nearly eclipses the entire track chris more than doubles the short tracks length with his remix channeling the originals cresting waves of fuzz into compacted pummeling hits that knock the track off its own path limping forward in a staggered lurch that feels about as far removed from techno as you can get its an interesting move for as the label continues with noisier territory gathering the loose ends of the labels roots and influences and throwing them together in a volatile boiling concoction of early-industrial menace and raster-noton digital austerity
music which makes up s second outing on is much more aggravated than his last its punchy jagged and almost visibly wired together by myriad machine-made lines and sines yre variously arpeggiated serrated or bristling and join up crisp percussion and real sounding drums into something thats curiously chicago yet melodic and forward-facing at the same time near-frenzied whistles squeals and screechy notes that add colour to the title track would sound odd in isolation but when softened with bumping kicks they soundtrack a speedy whizz through an unfamiliar cosmos rasping synths and ripped edges of are far from standard either y mesh with a dense network of mad xylophones woody ticks and drunken spirits tearing in all directions and offering little respite closer of the shares the same frazzled synth lines but this time drifting melodies offer a taming influence on the brash machines below
2004 was definitely s year after getting noticed with tracks like beautifull monday and if i could fly he was absolutely everywhere and wether you love him or hate him you certainly couldnt ignore him is his first release for and does it live up to the hype starts off with a simple kick drum before a bassline similar to joey beltram energy flash comes into the mix the track then builds up with some harsh stabs and atmospheric pads before the dekay sound starts to materialise with some lush pianos and strings driving the track along this track has already had the distinction of being featured on jonathan lisles new bedrock cd and dekay fans will lap this up for sure what if on the flipside is what you would call a more typical dekay track with uplifting stabs and keychanges galore and is quite similar in feel to his previous hit on dk recordings gods answer overall this is a good release from and though it doesnt quite have the impact of beautifull monday or if i could fly its still a very good track in its own right
one must assume that digi-only bonus tracks are the ones deemed a little too lacking to be pressed into wax which is weird because the alt mix of is the one that sticks out most on this release from its tightly intermingled beats kicks and soft percussion are that bit more purposeful than their more fluttering original counterparts in turn that focus allows the cutesy shy female vocal up top more room to breath (as does the lack of the originals starry twinkly melody) and the whole thing is that bit more subversive seductive and loveable as a result strikes a pose somewhere between the detailed make-up of micro house and the warm neon colours of underground pop champs visionquest it has a fuzzy synth line and plenty of charming melodic flashes which almost speak to you: come with me the thing seems to intimate well have some mischief midland removes the ambiguousness in his re-rub laying down hustling tumultuous drums and crafting a hunched-over hood-up groove in the process when muted chords appear through the woody contours later on they add some scale to the shuffle and are a moody yin to the barely contained polished melodic euphoria of george fitzgeralds remix of another digi-only cut feels somewhere in-between the two jones versions of and displays the same sandy smudged and soft edged sound design as though this one is ripe with a late night menace is the final bonus track and one which makes great use of a large spraying synth sound to join the dots between the blippy drippy and globular rhythms mapped out all around it whether for peak time bedtime or alone time theres plenty to pick from
inflight sessions is danny mcmillans output mix series for showcasing his current fascination with the deeper darker and techier side of the breakbeat spectrum his first cd introduced us to the mcmillan sound and while it was mixed nicely i personally found the track selection a little uninteresting possibly due to the fact that there were around 2 other compilations out at the time which featured some of the same tracks now its mix number 2 and mcmillans pulled out the latest tunes from his record box including new releases from his own inflight label one half of the 2 sinners klaus heavyweight hill opens up the mix with the big man - a chilled out atmospheric breaks tune to set the tone and with its emphasis on the top end rather than the bass makes for a swell start to the mix the chill out session doesnt last long as distraction diversions diversion pumps up the bass and rolls out the funkier breaks with some 70s funk style bongos and dub effects thrown in the mix tcrs chris carter keeps the bass booming on botty funk which draws influence from the plump djs sound especially with that housey breakbeat pattern no messing around with one of breakbeats heavyweight producers another one of breakbeats heavyweight producers is my favourite meat katie and he appears here twice both collaborative efforts firstly on the dark tribal style of juju alongside elite force if you have it on vinyl check the apollo kids remix for some rolling breaks style meat katie then teams up with lee coombs for not house music - damn straight its breaks music and this time theyve shed their tribal-house/breaks crossover style for more of a funky breakbeat affair a mix cd isnt complete without a few tracks from the artist that mixed it so mcmillan appears with partner tab on the teched-up and funked-up momentary lapse check the techy melody for some of that ol skool acid 303 throwback rolling thunder lives up to its name - its a breakbeat roller and the thunder comes from the deep growly vocals and the high-pitched tech stabs appearing on the track last but not least (in fact probably the best on this album) of mcmillan tabs tracks is above the clouds bringing the deep and heavy bass in tune with a crisp rolling breakbeat and sweet drum fills if you liked their other tunes like lost world supersonic and detroit then these 3 tunes should appeal to you mcmillan brings the mix to a close with precision cuts psychedelic squeezebox - a track which relies on the basic elements of breaks and bass with a few female vocal stabs on top bringing the techy stirrings and wash effects in the middle - in other words get remove the mayhem on top and wind down the mix for a mix that freq nasty calls sublime on the cd sticker this is a pretty charged up selection of breaks tracks (hmmm i wonder what freq nasty must be up to in his lab then ) 02 is definitely better than the first one and its easy to see why the label is called - with the amount of drivel being offered on airlines headsets inflight offers breakbeat fans a perfect alternative turn it up loud or play this one in the background
shaped from the splinters of local minneapolis faves hockey night philadelphia quintet put themselves on the summer mixtape map with the free release last spring of lead single an unabashed bit of cock rock swagger blustery horns ragged guitars and a strutty nah nah nah chorus sounded like a kind of reconfigured hair metal track fit now for indie kids clubbers and classic rock stans: anthemic streamlined and deftly referential or in terms befitting the tracks aims just kind of well fucking awesome of course even without the strength of getting blog tongues waggin wasnt hard had another point of intrigue sending demos of the songs of what would become this debut to lcd soundsystem/dfa mastermind james murphy familiar with late-era hockey night material murphy agreed to produce the album considering all of the delays that have plagued the record since its hard to ignore the providential feeling that finally arrives in spring thaw of full of slick cigarette lighter jams shout-along hooks and rounded out by murphys pitch-perfect nostalgic production s warmth and the instantaneity of its charms should convert even the sternest initial t rex clone dismissals ts a fond reformation of almost 40 years of hedonistic guitar-pop the stuff perhaps no longer of hockey night (cause the sport is dead) but of deep and timeless american friday and saturday nights the throaty thin lizzy stomp of opener ; the almost weezeresque power-pop of ; the s e -era pavement (one of hockey nights biggest influences) reverb squeal and paranoia of ; the slippery electric warrior strings of there are moments you almost recognize a guitar melody nicked straight from records of legend (name that lick: 3:35 of ) but theyre reconfigured here not as pastiche nor homage but simply as lovingly re-rendered classic rock listen to album standout : those slow spacious drums that basement dweller guitar the chorus of gummy oh-oh-ohs ts built for basic thrills 60s sha-ma-la garage rock with a modern urgency but without s shrewd sense of songcraft and murphys deft production you might not hear a better guitar record this year unless lcd soundsystem 3 fits the bill so much of s revelry would seem just a vapid cashing in on glory-year nostalgia that flirts with staples of our collective pop consciousness and sidesteps these pitfalls is a tribute both to the band and to murphy is loose good time pop that doesnt feel disposable open all the windows and see whats in the fridge spring is here
if the praise being hurled toward the uq crew is starting to sound a bit like a broken record blame the guys making them has come into his own in has continued his remarkable run and well hes just you know the trio unite on and its business as usual with each producer offering a distinct take on the deep house that they love so much s simple and effective beats anything on his underwhelming next level he keeps thing shorter and sweeter than almost anything there and layers on repeated snares and lovely bells over the usual synth washes switches up the beat on syncopating the normal 4/4 thump to give the track a driving momentum that contrasts perfectly with irresistibly slow synths that only complete their lengthy loops until youre completely locked in s a master at this which is why despite knowing exactly where its going you cant wait to hear it anyway finishing off things is yet another funhouse mirror masterpiece everything in it seems slightly off: the tentative piano playing that echoes awkwardly the vocal sample that seems to say fire in the hole at random moments the bleeps that just wont go away nd yet it works wonderfully head sounds like hieroglyphic being if the mathematics boss had spent more time listening to duke instead of ron hardy head indeed
new yorks dj spider and chicagos hakim murphy have been mainstays of the underground for years now each bringing to the table a highly idiosyncratic but deeply appealing envisioning of familiar house and techno forms but would you think to put them together perhaps not hakim murphy is a details man compositionally weaving sounds together just so; dj spiders tough-to-peg tracks on the other hand tend to sound like they were dropped from an alien spacecraft as it speeds away in the night regardless the two apparently have loads of mutual respect murphy has released a number of tracks on spiders label documenting his own and others dark excursions through the recesses and the kaiju ep fittingly on plan b finds the two properly joining forces their chemistry is palpable though the two take a minute to really get going is a jumble of contrasting styles that dont seem mutually soluble but after the palate-cleansing the duo hit more of a stride manages to pair the charred landscape of a milton bradley record with the gossamer deep house chords of someone like lerosa serpant pulls a similar stunt though it takes less of a feat to meld its metallic chords with the fierce techno backing all trappings of melody lift off by the playfully rhythmic a departure hammered home by the eps godzilla -sampling creepily beatless final bombing mission
what makes a genre workout worth hearing when someone expends the effort to make it a little bit more quarions head session for plak is one such track sounding like an accomplished bit of deep house with enough extras thrown in to woo the casual listener trilling piano an organ line that positively glistens and an expertly apportioned grunt-and-response: its all here ut what lifts quarions to rarefied heights is its structure it comes off more like a song than a track despite a distinct lack of vocals ing on wax for the first time on the flipside is swiss producer se-te-ve like quarion he takes a genre dub techno in this case as a starting point and then figures where to insert his own personality the rhythm is enough to get you going such is the power of its forward momentum and for a while its all he gives you ut soon enough a bleepy little melody cuts through the pounding groove announcing the arrival of yet another idiosyncratic producer to the plak roster with ripperton chaton and now se-te-ve popping up on the regular the deeper end of swiss techno seems in good hands
are not the first producers to use anonymity as a marketing tool in their case accompanied by ber-hip designer graphics of naked girls and horses but there is also a musical purpose: masking your identity also allows you to indulge in a bit of style-shifting chameleonism on the duo dispense with the folk and downbeat leanings of their back catalogue to make a track built for a big sound system the percussive force is hard-edged while the one note riff and deep analogue synthline are simply menacing something akin to an angry redshape track this is a dancefloor destroying 4/4 beast with a hint of old school rave to it flipping over also kicks off in a threatening fashion with a bombastic analogue fill and a well-placed mia sample more idm than 4/4 it s good but somehow feels cluttered after the purity of the short closing track is also somewhat messy and a less satisfying listen overall it phases through a metallic riff in classic warp fashion but without much real development zealous fans will know that this 12 is a re-release of an ultra-limited pack that came out last year this time without the t-shirts usb stick and screenprints pick it up for which is worth the price of entry alone
for decades was negative space a gap if you will whenever one would peruse the brian eno section either in their own collection or at the shop the epochal highly-influential ambient series that eno released in the late 70s and early 80s would scan as so: ambient 1: music for airports was enos gentle-drift follow-up to discreet music ambient 2 was the collaboration with pianist harold budd entitled the plateaux of mirror and then ambient 4 was enos on land but who what and where was ambient 3 left off virgin/ astralwerkss reissues of all of enos albums ambient 3: day of radiance was the work of a mysterious busker found in washington square park by eno on a trip to new york in the late 70s (separate from enos discovery and documentation of the no wave scene fermenting at the same time) turns out to have been the philadelphia-born the name laraaji a play on his name and initial while a path in new age music has since followed gordon had put out an album previous to day of radiance one produced by a new york lawyer who after encountering gordons mesmeric performance on the zither at a new age holistic event decided he wanted to record him immediately privately-pressed in an edition of 500 back in 1978 has rescued it from obscurity and rightly so: is the sort of album that might make heads perceive the cringe-inducing new age genre in a new light no doubt such gentle ambience underpins so much of our highly-acclaimed music at the moment in a recent chat with luciano he talked about focusing his attentions on beatless beautiful productions that forego the 4/4 though can mix into them while villalobos is on the record as being a fan of the hallowed ecm label which has specialized in releasing such crystalline sounds for decades now in addition to their jazz catalog even animal collective sampled a bit of pan-flute master zamfir on their most-recent ep crystal-haters beware the new age of new age might be upon us as for imagine alice coltranes harp runs as captured and effected by enos tape loop devices and youre close to the sound of gordon two majestic sprawling sound tapestries comprise the disc and each nearing the 25-minute mark gordons mastery of the zither (a stringed instrument that can be plucked strummed or malleted) makes for entrancing listening dont think you will just be able to doze off: gordon moves from blissed-out washes to driving passages to ruminative melodic moments that echo outward and slowly swirl back into cosmic dust clouds his sound ever-changing it might not be to every electronic music fans tastes but open ears will soon hear that gordon is not only a master of his instrument but also of that otherness that surrounds all music: space itself
and experimental outpost seem like an unlikely pairing at least until you hear the results the uk producers walloping broken beats are clearly catered to the dance floor but busts their foundations wide open after streamlining his sound into something closer to house and techno with his recent releases uses his new platform at to take a step back and refigure his sound incorporating shards of outside influence while keeping close to his early dubstep-inspired roots is undoubtedly his best ep yet the four-tracker starts off on its left foot is full of idm laser synths orchestral hits that warp on impact and free-floating drums really bares his teeth here overloading the tune with the heaviest sounds possible until it all sounds seductively unstable slower and deliberate rides an ultra-dubby bassline through a thicket of rattling drums and anxious chopped-up melodies proving theres as much power in the tension of his music as there is in the brute force the other two tracks are closer to s london-isms of past work is straightforward a hectic percussion workout punctuated by pressurized handclaps rounds off the ep with a work of dazzling contrast a whirling dervish of gleaming drums and sounds that are framed by methodically knocking beats that could double for morse code
steps up to the plate with the first release on his very own new label it s a single sided release that looks to get the label off to a very promising start atto d amore is the track and it begins early with some smooth pads and nice looping melody the track flows really nice throughout with a retro disco feel to it a somewhat trademark sound of santiago at times the track is quite devastating with smooth baselines working well with the melodic aspects and upbeat drum patterns it s quite a nice track and a very good way to start the label if you are a fan of serge s work then you will definitely find a place in your heart for this production
s the noughties draw to a close and music journalists scramble to pin down the decades most definitive underground club moments few will be able to overlook the one-man institutional presence of not only have his productions helped elevate labels as crucial as perlon m_nus and to the dizziest heights afforded in techno his live performances as a solo act and as part of cobblestone jazz have consistently positioned him at the forefront of new talent bringing technological hardware to the dance floor in the most innovative ways given his achievements its fitting that jonson should mark the end of the decade by showcasing his combined talent for prospective and retrospective vision on his latest offering in the i stands as the latest addition to the creepy shop-of-horrors already stocked with monsters like marionette and walking on the hands that follow me this time a marching breakbeat drives the familiar synthetic menace rguably his most frankenstein-like offering yet in the i at once entices tool users with plenty of specimens ripe for dissection and transplant but its strings provide well-paced drama that allows it to hold up fairly strongly as a standalone heavyweight hitter too its testament to the timelessness of his sound that extended originally produced in the former half of 00s can be placed confidently alongside the -side to provide a concise overview of jonsons maturity as a producer lchemist a cinematically rich beatless cut taken from a live soundtrack performed by cobblestone jazz for the silent film faust provides a final point of interest overtly combining jonsons penchant for horror and live experimentation by sound as well as name combined the b-side does little more than contextualise the aesthetic of a producer listeners will almost certainly already be familiar with leaving in the i to do the hard work of adding something new to jonsons intimidating reputation ultimately its not enough of a diversion to do anything other than uphold it but this hardly matters when jonson continues to hit the dance floor as monstrously as he always has
when we say a track builds sometimes it means that its repetitive and gains a mantra-like quality that eventually takes off sometimes it means the arrangement gradually gathers mass and thus momentum in the case of the lead cut from the three-track under r spell ep the build is easy to pinpoint: right around the four-minute mark when the bassline suddenly starts jumping around at twice the speed it had exhibited previously it juices a track that had mostly settled in gracefully swaying string pads occasional murmured wordless vocals relaxed funk guitar undercarriage and gives the whole thing some more bite follows with an equally bounding bassline here treated until it takes on a pulsating glow with a thumb-plucked feel even though its unlikely to have originated that way over drums with equal throb the whole track skitters holding to a steady pulse but jitterbugging all over it with a music-box tune occasionally chiming in warmly and a simple female vocal cry that gives it some early 90s flavor similarly busy bass anchors and directs though with less buttressing it the track does tend to disappear despite its battering is a pleasant 12-minute digital-only closer that starts low-key and stays there
berlin producer gilles iken k has come along way from the hypnotic tech house of his early releases on white his odd path has led to an immersion in the music of krautrock artist conny plank (of neu and cluster) whose music he remixed last year on iken has done an admirable job of integrating planks techniques into a functional dance music context distance hes come since his debut lp teupitz is startling evidence of an artist who can do whatever he wants speaking to musicbaum about the differences between and his last lp iken said: new one needs much more attention from its listener various parts get really weird if you close your eyes and listen you might follow but if its just music in the background it could get difficult t least thats what i think deed iken bends and refracts the deep house template into an uncanny psychedelic form his union with makes perfect sense our recent label of the month feature label co-founder konstantin spoke of being inspired by a small party at the new york record store dope jams: it was dance music but the bass drum was never the focus i really liked that iken too hits this sweet spot focusing on mid-range percussion atmosphere and motorik propulsion dabbles in the 70s german sound tempering a breezy techno snap with a guitar wash indebted to the frippertronics technique king crimson guitarist robert fripp used in his collaborations with brian eno iken told little white earbuds he likes to play enos thursday fternoon over techno tracks to put dance floors in an elegiac mood hes dropped in a few beatless gems here namely the wind-chiming and the aptly-titled drone takes the logical next step laying a blistering techno breakbeat under some beautiful new age-style ambience iken alternates between head-music and a soaring melodicism that shines through the murk title track traverses both zones starting with a hypnotic tom loop and can-style spookiness and ending with heavenly pads is unquestionably the albums banger it arrives with a skipping house beat the first rhythm that seems like a viable peak-time choice group of trippy arpeggios are eventually turned upside-down by a jarring and ecstatic funk-rock sample res also a sad grace to s work in keeping with the ethos on t he flits a doleful melody over a dubby house rhythm kraut-informed house with an ambient lean has codified into itself into a genre these days (see terekkes smudgy dance music or much of the further records catalog) but not much of it works as well for dancing as what s given us here hes infused his modern house sound with a history of cosmic music and arrived at something unique despite the albums title he seems more obsessed with the past either way the futures looking rosy for
luciano is taking it back to basics in in march the swiss-chilean artist announced the launch of baseac a new label dedicated to unreleased material from his archives several weeks later he unveiled origins an eight-week residency at cocoon in ibiza for a superstar that has recently seen his stock waver it feels like a timely move produced as back in 1997 (when he was 19) both tracks predate lucianos first release they offer an interesting insight into the early workings of a future electronic luminary they also stand up as solid tracks cadenza is a zesty slice of detroit-inspired techno characterised by the kind of flickering emotive melody that would become lucianos trademark showcases the glitchier more minimal side of the old luciano faint knocks foggy shimmers and taut strings makes for a dazzling composition with six more retrospective releases slated before the year is out luciano may well prove that hes not done yet

january seems to be a month of firsts for ristols which sees the first non-local producer on the label the hertfordshire-based shortstuff here no doubt thanks to the geographical relevance of redland resident hyetal its also notably the first collaborative 12-inch to be released on and undoubtedly one of the first absolutely essential dubstep 12-inches of close inspection of the label reveals two things: that dayglo pink and yellow is absolutely the appropriate colour to represent the tunes and that each track seems to have been started and finished by the opposing producers that latter point starts to make sense when you listen to the warped synth lines that open knowing hyetals previous catalogue well its easy to draw comparisons with the melodic colouring and drum patterns of this with tracks like neon speech the tracks are definitely cut from the same cloth but the duo decorate the edges differently keeping the groove placid splashing their cymbals and quickly snatching snare rolls ever present are some of shortstuffs trademark fancifully chopped and impeccably timed vocal stabs and the main bass riff pangs of his work on tracks like progression dont however screams like shortstuffs breakthrough rustling with its quaking almost comically delayed synth riff shocking out those cartoon ripples of audio wobble behind quick succession kick drums and aggressive cymbal work upping the pace from to a more regulative funky tempo and giving more attention to the conga lines and classic latin cowbell percussion along the way dont has the right dose of energetic hyper colour to fully complement the pitchbent synth attack of
breaks beats blondes is the long-awaited debut album from one of breakbeats uber-production duos deekline wizard throughout the years deekline (aka nick annand) has made a name for himself as a highly skilled dj and producer being responsible for tunes like dont smoke the reefer an official remix of old dirty bastards got your money and every posse crew (with freq nasty) rocketing into the dance charts in the uk and earning nick maximum kudos in the breaks garage and 2-step scenes not to mention his rat records label which is gaining momentum in the breakbeat scene for its attention to high quality breakbeat releases engineering wizard wizard (aka greg fleming aka dreb) is no stranger to dance music either working with the likes of the prodigy x-press 2 new order and playing guitars on the chemical brothers last album come with us as a team theyve also concocted some lethal dancefloor bombs such as a remix of skibadees man-a-man 4x4x4 and more recently get dirty baby done under the guise of the booty bouncers the album opens up with why dont you which sounds quite similar to a deekline remix of northends cant put no price for the album version theyve taken away the electro vocoder vocals and vocal samples and replaced them with yolanda on vocal duties and other electronic tidbits good thing too as yolanda provides dancefloor oriented lyrics and an easy to sing-along-to vocal hook yolanda reappears again on the deeper electro-infused wasting time where she sings about broken down relationships the converse of this is the booty bass influenced ill st blues the second single from the album where yolanda takes on love and relationships in a lighter manner the aussie breakbeat connection appears in the form of bushpig where deekline teamed up with melbourne based heavyweights nubreed phil k and ransom originally released as an instrumental on supercharged (to rave reviews too ) the two have updated the tune for the album with extra percussion and getting yolanda to pull off a ragga style toast on top and mixologists dj benny g to add in a few cuts and scratches mc spoonface (aka black legend) is known for his cover of barry whites trouble (as black legend) and also his work with freq nasty on his y4k mix and more recently adding vocals to freqs remix of kelis milkshake he provides vocals to around half of the tracks on the album most notably his stance on political issues covered on the acid house/breaks crossover truth is a lie where he namechecks people like bush blair and bin laden all the way to 50 cent the electro 2-step stomper feel the heat sees spoonface go into ragga mc mode and it sounds like deekline wizards answer to the freestylers boom blast from their recent lp raw as fuck spoonface and yolanda team up to provide more ragga vocals on all your love and last but not least he provides sung vocals and spoken word monologue on the closing track soulmonster on a dark grimey breaks tip sun is shining features an acoustic guitar hook played by long time friend and scratchmeister donna dee whos worked with deekline and wizard on several releases on various labels it has an upbeat tempo and a summery vibe featuring plenty of percussive elements and big tom tom souding drum fills throughout responsible for vocal duties are desy on indian style vocals and drumnbass mc ic3 4x4x4 is another acid house/breaks crossover tune and was the first single to be released on the album and features the vocals of david elliot (dionne warwicks son) and sampled vocals from michael watford the tune itself broke heavily into the dance market and reached number 1 on the australian dance charts heavy on the four to the floor beats the tune features a funky bassline squelchy acid house hook and plenty of drum fills throughout while both vocalists give it an old skool rave feel the only tune on the 13 track lp which does not have a vocalist on it is the miami bass/electro breaks influenced bodypopper which itself is receiving full support from the likes of the plump djs zed bias and many others its a bass heavy monster featuring plenty of electro activity synth hooks vocodered vocals and b-boy drum beats its deekline and wizards interpretation of 80s electro breakdance music with scratches done by benny g from the mixologists deekline wizard have taken the unorthodox path with their album - the vocal infused breakbeat and sure it has been done before by many breakbeat artists but never an album full of breakbeats and vocals (minus one instrumental cut) breaks beats blondes takes on a very human approach getting interactive with the listener as the vocalists sing and rap about life politics and feeling good on the dancefloor this one should raise the stakes on future breakbeat lps
is a four-man live/dj collective hailing from nijmegen in the netherlands and after making their production debut just a few months ago on the local wolfskuil records imprint the group begins with maan an exquisite ep that launches records lush low-gravity techno is the name of the game here as suggested by the titles and oth tracks have just enough drive to be let out of the chill room but this sub-120 pm stuff is for more introspective dance floors where theres room (and time) for heads to get lost in dense foggy soundscapes theres a 90-second break in the middle of for instance all the better to reveal a hypnotic array of glitches and subtle percussive details that weave in and out of the mix slows things down even more offering a sturdy dubby groove and an addictive reverb effect that lazily whips across channels like a boomerang the all-dutch affair is completed with a remix of from the reliable duo of ang lis and search their rework pitches up to a more club-ready 4/4 tempo and adds a touch of darkness but crucially it keeps alive much of the original versions pristine cosmic-forest atmosphere it rounds out an excellent start to the new label but i think those who seek out maan will probably be more in the mood to light up a spliff and space out to s originals
in the wake of hype williams dean lunt has seemed to play on his newfound solo status lbums the redeemer and lack metal placed a strong emphasis on lunts own voice and riffed on the most solitary musical mode going that of the confessional singer-songwriter his latest project led by one dj escrow and featuring production work from rca has a different dynamic s debut single is in some respects a familiar dean lunt track and in others its anything but first the familiar lunts squat couplets remain the focus jostling with bits of sampled dialogue (london accents: check disturbing undertones of aggression: check) his lyrics cover familiar themes: weed and alcohol race ( get these white girls out of my home ) and a probably-ironic comment on the burdens of fame ( everyone got a question for us / cant they give a nigga privacy ) the instrumental ticking away behind him though is unusually slick few skilfully mangled baby cries feel like rca asserting his presence; the crisp drums and the smooth filter sweep by which they make their exit work wonderfully (they leave behind the sound of somebody lighting a spliff naturally ) s if to remind us that lunts no longer the main draw the single comes with a vocal-less version the beat loping hypnotic and pretty much dubstep deserves the second airing
have upped the ante with their fourth release timeless and eternal as the phases of the moon / sees substance and vainqeuer at their best with two direct and detailed tracks which prove that despite the seemingly hermetic nature of the productions the scion sound world is evolving with subtle expansions when ren l we first collaborated with fellow hard wax member peter kuschnereit for the first chain reaction record as scion in 1995 the duos sound became a blueprint for the innovative label s their separate contributions to chain reaction accumulated substance s (peter kuschnereit dj pete) few releases were defined by their direct dancefloor orientation while vainqueur (ren l we) became better known for tracks like elevation that focus on sequencing and synths rather than percussion together these two are a formidable combination as these balanced tracks demonstrate uilding from the formula that s still working after well over ten years glides through a spacious intro and builds with upfront beats that are signature substance dub delays are pushed into spacious metallic echoes while a distant horn glimmers from the oceanic end of dubstep faintly signalling common ancestry the -side flips directly into 4/4 propelled by crisp high-hats layered chord stabs refracted with decay and meticulously crafted atmospherics that are even more vivid with texture than we ve come to expect; these are analogue textures that expand the internal space scion have used their classic pads and delay template to make two bigger richer tracks that are as always much more than the sum of their techniques
jacob hodge martin might spin off into more experimental directions with his solo project but he and matt lambert maintain a distinctly fluid house groove as balancing intricate melodies with a knack for raw grooves the bristol duo underline their growing dance floor maturity on the lead track is awash with spitting hi-hats and emotional synths and it blossoms after an elegant understated breakdown is more muscular with thudding toms vicious handclaps and a screaming vocal sample merging to form an early-hours workout that groans under the heft of s bass has more in common with the lead cut mellifluous chords are a bedrock for an embellishment of arpeggios cosmic bass and fela kuti-style analogue synths this is an ep bathed in a warming glow
when s new ep landed in my postbox i got a little excited his stealth ep on urbantorque last year was a great slice of catchy tech house that became a staple in cattaneo and kleinenberg sets for months so i was intrigued to hear how this talented tech house would fare on a more progressive tip title track is an early 00 s progressive throwback and while some may get nostalgic at the familiar sounds i got bored it s centred around sweeping melodies and a deep heaving bassline but sounds a little too similar to lexicon venue s 2003 remix of depeche mode s only when i lose myself to these ears it s a useful track with a lot of dancefloor merit but lacks originality on the flip is a proggy cut that cuts through similar terrain it sounds a little dated closer to the formula of old with tight drums building around a simple riff unfortunately it doesn t quite hit like his urbantorque efforts and ends up sounding a little flat all is relying too much on effects and filters and the creativity of his previous efforts isn t evident here at all this talented producer misses the mark with this one the progressive sound isn t where shines take a listen to his eps on urbantorque to hear him at his techy best
s recent full-length was criticized by some as faceless and functional but these two remixes from the are anything but ovum boss josh steps up on the a-side streamlining the title tracks glistening booty-tech angles into much warmer and more liquid lines busy snares scratch out scattered rhythm while jazzy chord stabs keep up a pleasant sense of pumping house pressure throughout no mean feat given the nine-minute duration meanwhile on the b-side axel transforms the frozen depths of with his trademark sense of off-kilter fun and non-linear progression originals male vocal becomes more prominent while soulful samples and sunny instrumentals interrupt the otherwise trilling fairground-like keys which stream in the background once the swede has worked you into a dreamy hypnosis the sandy beats break change foot and kick off again into a fuzzy soft focus world somewhere else altogether
turned up on the very first release from dresdens and now he returns for his first full ep on his hometown label his take on house music has always leaned towards the moody downbeat end of the spectrum with crisp unvarnished drum machines nesting inside hushed chords; sounds him going slower and murkier still with dragging kicks and sludgy bass that would fit right in with tracks from kassem mosse or claro intelecto the broken-down cracked-out vibe is accentuated by a top line that bristles with bright harmonics faintly recalling oni yhuns glassy high end and strange spoken-word snippets about a man on fire seemingly snatched from police radio morphed shakes off the muddled vibes and digs into a far more determined groove with dry jacking house beats offset by just a hint of latin shimmy no matter how placid the chords its still nasty as anything with a raw resonant bass line and even more bite in the drums s always with he keeps the rhythm loose daubing off-beat accents on top of a swinging slightly unstable groove finally trots out a meandering spoken word over sprightly rhodes chords and chattering drum machines for a jammy track that would make a fine accompaniment to the close of the night when the music fades out against the clatter of empty bottles
the phrase no future has a long history in contemporary music particularly in london can trace it all the way from the sex pistols in the 70s through to instra:mental around the turn of the decade in a climate of neoliberalism and right-wing politics the phrase channels feelings of frustration and nihilism in young people as an old punk slogan feels more relevant to me than ever before london producer moir told us while announcing his second album on his new album by that name his music is as slate-grey as ever but gone is the drowsiness of earlier releases the jittery nervousness that replaces it makes more engaging than most of its predecessors the wiry basslines of the first track and its follow-up make for a swift introduction to moir s more confident sound buoyant though not exactly upbeat the -assisted connects his self-described london techno with the citys drum bass legacy his production slippery and broken is more energetic than usual even better is who rides the odd beat with the expertise of someone who has been mcing for decades there are other touches that give moir s music a livelier feel on and the funky electro of the handclaps are playful and abundant another track with comes with an addictive bassline enhances shelter s wobbly gait with a big trancey synth lead is dance music thats groovy in spite of itself mirroring the kind of twitchy energy you get after pulling an all-nighter as irrepressible as the album is its also as thoroughly greyscale as moir s previous work which can make it feel sludgy and samey while fine on their own tracks like and tend to blur together and are overshadowed by standout tunes like its an album that could have been a near-perfect ep at its high points presents the most inventive work of moir s career as a whole package though its a bit of a grind as glum as it is propulsive as an album that reflects the times maybe thats the point is after all a bleak idea and moir has made some bleak dance music to go with it
watching michael rathbun develop has been fascinating because he tends to swallow whole every sound and genre he encounters and then spits them back up into something edgy the concoctions vary in quality from edge-of-your-seat jitters to midtempo mush but when hes on hes really on precedes his forthcoming second album on tectonic and its a salivating taster of what the atlanta producer has been up to lately which will be on the lp is the most curious stringing hyperactive percussion over a thick synth pummeled by low-end the closest analogue would be dj rashads newer material but rathbun has a sci-fi tinge more boards of canada than it is hip-hop dipping into the grimy waters that seem to be washing over the bass music world this year has percussion somewhere between clipse and wiley but the clipped vocal phrases and streaks of acid are unmistakably flip over the record and almost sounds like something on hypercolour with its zig-zagging bassline rathbun dresses up the background with more pretty synths and squelchy textures but despite being a fine house tune it lacks the pizzazz of the more experimental a-side consisting mostly of slap bass and some dislocated snares the trippy suffers from the same problem its like a canvas for rathbun to spray with various percussion sounds and strange effects an odd listen that never quite takes off

next up in the choice series is one half of legendary us house outfit masters at work this mix is neither boundary defying nor specific to one genre as dope takes us back to the golden age of disco funk and all things soul seductive the tracklisting reads like a who s who of influential artists that have been covered bootlegged or remixed including kool the gang earth wind fire and james brown so does the mix break free and shine or fade away into just another choice compilation cd1 kicks off in ordinary fashion funked up and full of percussion that gets your head nodding but not your feet tapping it carries along in the same vein until around track 5 level 42 starchild which starts with a mean loop then shifts gear as the vocal punches in the melody on this number really carries the mix forward and its only now that i feel dope starts flexing some catalogue muscle given hes known to have around 35 000 records daytons sound of music really hits the soul with its 80s induced male vocals firming up the mix and enhancing the music the appearance of all-time classic kool the gangs open sesame makes me wonder why dope hasnt decided to be a little more experimental or tried to re-educate the younger cats its quite clear he has tried to capture the time when he started djing from the selected tracks and the way the mix has been put together but it does seem to run contrary to the idea of a new compilation tavares - it only takes a minute girl starts cd2 off in higher octane fashion its followed by together forever by exodus a real collectors gem which has the raw sounds of vinyl old and used the track appears in its original form and its good to see very few re-edits on this mix a refreshing change from the multitude of dex and fx mixes out there ingram mi sabrina tequana changes the vibe taking things a little deeper with a moody guitar riff before the mix heads into the final corner - the bpm at 130 and some big names still to come track 11 is a remix of kashmere stage bands super strut displaying soul and strength with jumpy trumpets and sleepy flutes you can really hear dopes influence all over the arrangement a fitting conclusion to the mix comes in the form of hokis pokis nowhere (danny krivit edit) a nice drum-fuelled number with male vocals chanting on my way to nowhere both discs are a good representation of what you would hear if you saw at madame jojo s or back home in the states the mix is a respectful and nostalgic nod to a time when music was free and simplistic minus the politics and heavy rotation of pop fodder and successfully encapsulates the feeling and energy of dopes musical education and experiences the second disc featuring a lot of tracks with well-known vocal snippets or rhythms which have been heavily sampled is the stronger of the two and also exemplifies s seamless and organic mixing parts of the mix were inspirational and helped me to understand a little more about both as producer and live performer still this choice mix will not be for everyone you can however be assured of hearing a mix that has been carefully crafted and compiled by someone with no fewer than 15 years in the dance music industry
german label alphacut (along with a handful of subsidiaries) has been pumping out forward thinking drum bass for a decade now and theyre celebrating their landmark 0th release with a three part remix series of past highlights part two of the ov r construct 0n series sees berlins martsman rework russian duo and dutchman phuture t take on s excellent martsmans remix of is more like a complete overhaul a techstep banger in dub purgatory its growling basslines stutter into a canyon of echo that makes the tracks powerful strut all the more fierce these arent your typical drum bass weapons full of lockstep drums and rigid patterns feels unpredictable and the way both tracks manipulate silence makes their drops even heavier phuture ts rework approaches drumfunk in its kinetic rush juggling breaks and discordant pianos until it breaks out into a john bonham esque drum solo in a genre still ruled by formula these tracks are as startling as a slap to the face

a favourite of both gilles peterson and theo parrish has some serious backing behind him after debuting on sound signature last year (collaborating with parrish on effortlessly soulful flowers ) ghanaian singer has had fans waiting with bated breath for his next move with a smoky jazz sensibility that wouldnt sound out of place on eglo his follow-up ep proves hes no one-hit wonder the title track is a humid torch song floating with languid guitars and unquantized drums that sound like something parrish might play ashongs vocals tend to waft by in a fragrant cloud recalling wispy psychedelia of early verve (imagine an r -influenced richard ashcroft) the funkier is eps standout with chunky fretwork that punches through haze the layered vocal shows off ashongs impressive range but the takes trick even fur r crafting a doo-wop ditty with choral voices and careful drums that gently increase in pressure its a work of remarkably intricate build-and-release if res one criticism that could be levelled at its that tracks dont fall far from same tree but when y sound as sweet as this how could you complain
spite of his growing fame following the crossover success of his debut lp drone logic and the ensuing tours s sound hasnt become any more commercial or approachable fact its gone the other way hes made steely techno with volte face as while his last solo record was severe and minimalist compared to past work tapped rrose and bdulla rashim to remix that ep which illustrates the sound he prefers these days hes exploring techno that makes its mark through texture and heavy repetition rather than melody or catchy samples kicks is a big deal for ts his biggest project since drone logic and his first mix since fabriclive 66 the release that first brought him to a wider audience that one was effervescent and colourful the product of a producer who came up under erol lkans wing kicks on the other hand is as stark as its cover photograph brooding and monochrome from start to finish ts a rock solid techno mix with few surprises or left turns can hold his own in this style but a collection of tracks from artists like shl mo and might not have the same crossover appeal hes used to that said the mix is still full of drama and striking moments first one happens early on when the ominous drones of rroses remix of s streak across the stereo spectrum after s ambient intro sets the pitch black mood s helps kick the mix into high gear and blends perfectly into s barnstorming s excellent arrives next driven by a repetitive spoken word sample the kind that used to be s signature through the mixs midsection and back half lets the tracks play out longer than many techno s would s goes on for ten minutes highlighting their intricacies and allowing them to build momentum that energy spills over into an explosive finale that peaks with an exclusive track from the gritty rave up which invokes the throbbing basslines of drone logic in a new pared down setting s mixing style sets him apart from other techno s who might prefer to intricately stitch tracks together or simply slam into new ones with hot mixes his approach comes to life at the end with edit s remix of s ts a rigid tune that could fall flat in the hands of many other s but the way lets it breathe highlights the killer string melody heightening the drama just by giving it some space even if hes working with more straight laced techno these days s personality still shines through
the next release on the always quirky label comes from a young scot by the name of ewan mackenzie and his alias his first track on the label by the name of also comes with a club friendly mix by the mfa first up though is the original mix which be warned is an ambient affair not a bad track at all as far as ambient productions go with smooth beats accompanied by some subtle melancholic guitar riffs and soothing vocals the holden noise tool that follows is a nice collection of sounds and slight percussive elements combined with a deep smooth baseline that can be used in many creative ways one would think turn it over and you have the mfa s help help remix that turns the track into a very nice club friendly moment the trademark crisp beats meet twisted effects and haunting vocal samples early on and builds nicely with some smooth baselines the track though does take a twisted turn that sees scratching effects come in to the track midway in before shortly returning to normal resumption there is another tool at the end with the holden acoustic tool that despite the name only features some subtle acoustic elements with some hi hats included combined with deep sounds and effects another pretty solid release on the border label good variety with an ambient track being signed up accompanied with a pretty good remix on the flip by the mfa

a founder of avadon one of tel avivs most popular techno nights is already well known in the dj community as a dj he may rarely step outside of israel but his music has made it onto essential mixes from ben klock and me dixon as well as several house and techno compilations it shows the wide appeal his productions have whether hes working with driving detroit-style techno or catchy tech house avni ties it all together with a lingering thread of soul his installment for monad series begins ordinarily enough has a deep punchy kick and shimmery rave stabs that flash like much of avnis music its a dance track with hooks then things head into the wild with field recordings nanoscopic sound design entwined instrumentation and a female vocalist with monumental range is like a trove of sound machine whirrs tiny zips drips dings and other quirky bits are some of the the curiosities on display contained within a cabinet of surging dubby bass and are the eps mystic closers built around hypnotic singing bowls woodwind melodies and otherworldly vocals the former is set to a steady forward thrust that yawns with industrial creaks and acid drips the latter strips those electronic elements away leaving its meditative core raw and exposed its at once jarring and beautiful and transports the listener somewhere indiscernibly strange
like making an album or starting your own party setting up a record label has long been a rung on the dance music ladder to success in the case of the bronx-born pair the inauguration of two imprints in quick succession first tuskegee alongside seth troxler and now their own cuttin headz could be an attempt to keep the fires of a show-stopping 2013 stoked and burning but given that both labels carry such strong personal themes (the former is a label of cultural heritage the latter is for local talent from new york city) i think its reasonable to suggest that they mostly just wanted to release some records and show of their artwork the first release on cuttin headz produced by the brothers is a three-tracker of rolling dance floor house that smacks of balmy evenings at dc-10 but for all its sand sun and fun the music on the white isle can be notoriously generic and the ep falls largely into that category the groove on the opening track for example is incredibly flat fares better matching slamming kicks to a funkier bassline but its still little more than a passable club cut like the opener sounds limp and even unfinished with bland synths laid across a bumbling frame for six minutes this ep gets cuttin headz off to a shaky start but with a debut release from destination void (aka dj spider phil moffa and brendon moeller) up next theres hope things can be turned around
three years on from his last solo record launches his label with the four-track warm tonal touch ep maybe it was the experience of working with pariah on their hard-nosed karenn project or just his years entrenched in the belly of dark clubs but jamie roberts has emerged favoring a decidedly straightforward techno sound this is rugged soundsystem music arranged specifically with precision and movement in mind no catchy samples little melody no color in another producers hands the simple rhythmic churn and distant sirens of mightve come off hackneyed or flat; roberts makes it feel the opposite of that a real standout is which has a kick pattern like the thrum of helicopter blades its all steeped in pinprick textures and ghastly shudders but what sticks with you longest is what sounds like an aluminum shed roberts used as a percussion instrument the slight pitch shifts between each thwack just about eke out a hook from the pattern and do actually mix tonal synths into their mechanized tremors though only the latter gives them a discernible shape and to its detriment the buzzy doodle on is an appropriate feint whereas s melodic loop sits too comfortably over the basic 4/4 structure but the track is a rare case of blandness on an ep that finds potency in common practices
with enormous hits like rej or where at behind them you could argue that is currently going through a phase of self-discovery where do we go from here mes fourth mix cd has a few answers first half-hour is what you could call an immersive experience: with no clear hooks or thumping kick drums and with a fondness for chords in the higher end of the pitch spectrum and circling almost sleep-inducing melodies it allows me to invest a mood a proper club environment probably wouldnt ever allow (if the very idea of the mix cd still has some sort of meaning you have it in this passage ) for instance the transition from s wintry electronica to s me itself interlaced with s dub of is spot on if slightly disorienting on the other hand the inclusion of mumbai-based composer s (a cut from the recently reissued synthesizing: ten s to a disco beat ) is a welcome discovery: this is tune selection at its most clever and least gratuitous especially when me bridge the generation gap that separates it from s theatrics on so pertinently (even if the transition is rhythmically speaking a bit abrupt) that said the perfectionist in-key segue is more brainy than remotely emotive and it does impose a sense of cold calculated distance seven minutes after has started its operatic meanderings t tes motoric kick drums (from 2010 or single) makes itself heard this is precisely when switches gears and allows itself to be more lively s bouncy showcases the first inclusion of actual discernible vocals and offers an appreciated relief from all the previous abstractions mix then somehow anti-climatically climaxes with s as four s rehashing blends chopped vocal snippets with heady and unrepentant synthetic stabs and then all rather cleverly ends with canadian indie minstrel pallett whose no is made more robust and beating thanks to mes reworking of their single its mixing at its most audacious and it does leave the listener on a high savvy note overall though is a singular if demanding at times opus: punctilious almost punishing in its rigor its impressively unpredictable here and there yet it still has a clear idea of where it wants to go and how it is going to get there further it shows impressive crate-digging credentials while displaying highbrow technical dexterity that said it lacks the sense of urgency that a release like a critical mass recorded last year with peers dixon and henrik schwarz had and this is why you cant help but feel theres something lacking at the very core of this otherwise craftily structured mix a pulsing me maybe

jamess younger brother aidan lavelle releases his first track eli under his moniker with after already having the track featured on three of very strong compilations; james holdens balance 005 jzs sound in motion and global undergrounds afterhours the original of this track is an uplifting and energetic mixture of sounds outside of the slightly more standard bass-line introduction this production features a beautiful blend of building synths and strings that last for the main portion of this track its a very safe tune and a very easy choice for djs as the intro and outro make it rather easy way to bring in all the things that make eli such a wonderful tune it is because of its most soothing melodies that it has been slotted perfectly into afterhours 2003 compilation already been featured in sets by many of the big name djs and sets a most impressive basis for someone like james to really tear apart james zabiela covers the remix duty finely with his rave lizard remix of aidan eli he gives the tune more of an evil breaks angle showcasing a variety of sounds it spans from a dirty electronic sounding bassline to a very old skool euphoric rave like breakdown which should bring back some sweet memories for those of you that have been around and back the male electronic vocal added also gives his mix a sense of greater depth where the original is a great early-to-peak night tune zabielas rave lizard mix is a more on the other side of the plate a peak-to-late night spirit lifting affair for those of you with access to jzs recent radio 1 essential mix you can hear his rave lizard mix (with a hint of dialect added for good measure) played just over an hour and a half into the mix - simply amazing
you could say that painted himself into a corner with his early output fter all once youve developed a reputation for supplying the kind of jaw-dropping dance floor moments found on unglued or cactus it must be difficult to know where to go next that may partly explain the erlin producers relative quietness this year; his one release the patient electro roller shuttered while masterfully wrought felt like a consolidation of past successes rather than a bold step forward in gnes tj hertz has developed a new and particularly vicious weapon in this ever-escalating arms race with his own discography in the way that many tracks chew up familiar signifiers and spit them out in absurd new shapes its tempting to see this track as hertzs response to the recent vogue for industrial techno for most of its length its a suspenseful beast centered on a single bone-crushing thwack in the breakdown however that sound is stretched out into tortured plateaus of noise writhing and blistering with feedback efore long the whole thing grinds to an agonising halt before flicking back into holding-pattern mode hertz knows when his work is done s relative straightforwardness comes as something of a relief its sleek electro beat is of a piece with shuttered but its a touch funkier and a shimmering synth supplies patches of light s with its predecessor the devil is in the detail odd nasal vocal samples punishing sub-bass and a particularly lush sci-fi bleeps and from unassuming beginnings once the five minutes are up youll find yourself locked in its vicelike grip
and chilean electronic producers who work with the rhythms of their homeland have apparently been friends for over 20 years the latter is another chilean electronic producer working with the rhythms of his homeland while the two have played and toured together this is their first joint release perhaps its more accurate to say this is their first track together; the titular b side is a solo cut the collaborative track starts with modular synth gurgles whistles and groans before a staticky beat and percussion finally sprout these are the main elements for almost 15 minutes an additional synth drone and a funky bassline adds more flavor but the whole thing breathes with an organic evolution that feels serene rich and energizing by contrast starts with a familiar techno pulse only to introduce a scratchy dissonant violin loop at the midpoint this unexpected turn saves the track the violin goes on to disintegrate and devolve otherwise its fairly desultory its the type of curveball excels at
we live in an age of whistleblowers and i m not talking about over enthusiastic ravers it s very difficult to keep things under wraps these days thank god that record labels haven t gone the way of a lot of governments otherwise there d be a lot of music hacks and pr people with destroyed lives and pending court appearances (well more than there are and for entirely different reasons) suffice to say the appetising tracklist for ch teau s new language mix leaked a long time ago (hey two months is a bloody long time in the world of electronic music) so by the time i heard it the excitement rested with how each piece fitted into the bigger puzzle resurgence (or unkillability) of deep house and minimal techno in has been remarked upon at length: it seems like just as everyone feels the need to repudiate minimal as a meaningful category a lot of people appear to be searching and striving to get their minimalist fix albeit through different tropes: may be all about the continuation of minimal by other means a whole season in search of a suffix to bond with one good enough to save it from the backlash italo and electro ( proper electro as my dj friend jan would be at pains to emphasise partly because it s the kind he plays) have ghosted the margins of a lot of compositions this year often the edges are knocked glide smooth in tech house disguise or the tracks float in space in disco mode but sometimes it s real italo/electro back with a vengeance (and updated sound design) such as on s wonderful falling which is placed here as the centrepiece of this mix both in terms of duration and intention all three of these sneaky returns are present here integrated within a masterplan that bears the ch teau s royal seal first is on the duo s own a track which is so reminiscent that three different people i ve played it to swear they ve heard before n there s snuten s wild n free ( ) a track with a wild twirl and a neat girly weasel pop vocal that deserved more attention than it got when it was released in 20 mix works really well right up until the last few tracks then comes unlucky number thirteen ch teau s own remix of track is left in the mix for seven minutes and somehow despite the fact that (elementally at least) it s a progression from what has come before is too long is a little dull and has an annoying underworld y vocal loop in it ot only that but it mixes into which i for one am deadly sick of read the label selectors it s and take heed: no more no more sun can t compare and please no more where we at just for a while please unfortunately these last few tracks take up 25 of the running time which means the whole thing feels like it peaks too soon (just after s see ) and spends the remainder of proceedings coming down right when more is needed more house more italo or just more of the something from the earlier part of the mix why not just end with the twelfth track s wonderful dilinda or close with something fitting the mood (but this is deeply deeply subjective) like a massive triumphant mix into i feel love or a big splashdown into i dunno todd s eurodans or maximilian skiba s goodbye c64 okay so who am i to tell them what to play but all the same i feel like the mix reaches its natural conclusion after the forty seventh minute after which it overstays its welcome for no good reason in order to resolve this issue and not drive myself away from what is otherwise an enjoyable mix i did what anyone of the mp playing generation does i deleted the last three tracks added my own and gave my edit four stars

theres a rule of thumb in hollywood that says the more screenwriters that are attached to a film the bigger the mess its tempting to apply the same yardstick to s ep which includes nine remixes nine remember when rakim said wicked as i kicked it no need to remix it what happened to that ethos an ongoing collaboration between troy pierce and gibby miller s latest single is a gloomy echo of the paranoid electro-eyeliner sound that was perfected by adult ten years ago miller does a terrific ian curtis impersonation with dead-eyed lyrics about his emotions while pierce pegs the vocals to a spare electro-rock rendition of a depeche mode ballad the result is an undeniably catchy slice of retro synthpop but the homage is so carefully posed that its nearly lifeless also suffers from bad timing given that groups such as poni hoax and she wants revenge have already cannibalized 80s no/new wave with more guts and daring with such unimaginative source material its hard to justify an ep of remixes and its even more difficult to put your mind around nine of them particularly when they all sound remarkably similar one wonders if m_nus intended the digital version of to be treated as a dj-friendly menu of subtly differentiated products rather than a proper release that would be heard from end-to-end perhaps such formal distinctions dont matter anymore; regardless of intention m_nus brought all nine remixes to market here they are ranked from least-to-most interesting 1 jpls club mix the original version pitched up and pushed through a delay effect 2 jpls mix same as above but hard means no vocals or delay effect 3 mike bryants remix oddly clipped vocals that build tension for a climax that never arrives 4 mike bryants remix several quasi-booka shade synths pinned to a ticking beat; not very eerie 5 swayzak mix opens with some ambient drift as drawn-out chords underpin a non-descript patchwork of vocal samples and drums 6 berg mix a slow build-up to a stripped-down drum kit an upbeat whistle and a helicopter somewhere in the background 7 alexi mix jittery basement style with rubberband effects in the spirit of clink records 8 bruno pronsato mix meandering and emotional with pretty guitars on a skeletal framework 9 thrill cosbys broken door mix heavy breathing vocals that evoke the glam attitude of a classic superpitcher track but without the shuffle if anything highlights the problem with digital releases: production costs are nil and distribution is dirt cheap so why not include nine remixes the lack of financial constraints however means that digital releases are the most reliable barometer of a labels standard of quality control in the case of m_nus the bar needs to be raised eight or nine notches
in the last few years neues deutschland studio a small cluttered room tucked away in an office complex in friedrichshain has become a minor hub of berlins music scene sued co-founder svn has rented this space for years hosting countless jam sessions with like-minded that is leftfield producers from close friends (dynamo dreesen dj fett burger) to out-of-towners like made up sound lately hes been at it with henrik jonsson k porn sword tobacco with whom hes previously released music on cido records and kontra-musik on their latest collaboration - the two artists click better than ever like much of the music emanating from neues deutschland - is impressively bare-bones: the label is called the sleeve design imitates tape reel packaging and the tracks are simply called and so on (even more utilitarian than svns usual go-to untitled ) the music follows suit both in its austerity and charm each track is a taut rhythm played on brittle drums with swarms of psychedelic sounds placed low in the mix whispers whooshes birdlike chirps and so on the beats are hypnotically minimalist but not without a bit of oomph by svns standards and are club bangers the atmosphere is vaguely tropical (as it often is with these two) except on which trades the woody sound palette for something colder and more metallic little tweaks and one-off flourishes remind you these tracks are played live hardly anything major happens in them but each one always ends too soon
fter cutting his teeth with his production partner versa is now going it alone following his full solo debut on smokin sessions back in february the uk producer drops the ep on new london label from the first four bars of the title track its clear that has his roots in dubsteps golden years the atmospheric 2-step tilt of the kick drums smacks of early headhunter and second-wave kryptic minds albeit with a breezier feel jolts of electricity add colour to the composition rounding off a neat opener on his soothing downtempo interpretation utonomic affiliate sc strips the original of its sturdy backbone and inserts a dubby pulse doffs its cap to burial adding heartfelt vocals to a taut and spacious frame while on the one hand its hard not to feel that the ep sounds a little dated one cant deny s ability to infuse his well-rounded soundscapes with a decent degree of feeling

the name - might give you an insight into the playfulness of 28-year-old david morris riff-heavy constructions however the clues stop there because morris has more in common with maximalists like boys noize and crookers than the mario brothers theme tune nd while hes not quite reached the same level as these hes gathering support from them and the like with his own flavour of impressionistic club music the guy seems to enjoy making synthesizer riffs that sound like actual things and building weighty club music upon it so as the title track stomps along crunchily a duo of characters dance around with manic grins on their faces the first a christmas elf has the childish innocence of a music box but before you think things are getting too sentimental a large fat man/duck waddles in the juxtaposition works well but make sure your audience has a sense of humour (or that you want to take the piss out of them) before dropping this one is more serious with a giant buzzsaw pulsing in and out and whirring too close for comfort so is of : s the name implies theres an almighty cascade of dark melancholy organs the duck man returns with a vengeance halfway through but hes not happy this time and therell be trouble breaking the 4/4 of its colleagues is with horses clattering along to battle in a kind of mutant dancehall style and a cavalcade of buglers sounding the way ll great fun and a deviation from the raw sawtooth heavy in-your-face style thats too prevalent these days fresh creative take on light-hearted electro house is always welcome
the gap between hardcore and techno is closing some artists have a foot in both worlds but keep them separate while others are happy migrating between the two lenny dees label a techno offshoot from its older hardcore parent industrial strength is one of the few places dedicated to the overlap its where hardcore acts (tymon innovative stormtrooper) from industrial strengths roster sidestep into techno while underground techno veterans dabble in harder or more experimental sounds the name is fittingly ambiguous: the labels sound ranges from the brutal industrial techno of tymons to the wire ep to more 4/4-friendly cuts like d a v e the drummer and lenny dees collaboration sees two venerable techno artists pair up for s most experimental record yet you may know gez varley from lfo and for his sleek minimal productions as g-man mike humphries has also been producing a more slamming style of techno since the early 90s as heard on his label mastertraxx varley and humphries might seem like an unlikely match but their ep hits a tough and trippy sweet spot especially on full of rubbery sound design it boings about on sprung surfaces for an eight minute-long romp that could be even longer is more boisterous but no less fun its the sound of all that pent-up energy letting rip with an added carnivalesque melody line with a bold breakdown is the toughest of the lot its a marmite move that youll either love or hate this isnt s best release but its one of the weirdest
since 2006 experimental cleveland trio have been massaging their analog synthesizer creations the earliest efforts at which the band themselves lampooned via title with that years bullshit boring drone band into the kind drifty contemplative compositions that have made them one new cosmic musics most consistently compelling acts within that ungraspable clash luck circumstance hype and bona fide talent they seemed like one the numberless retro-inclined groups that might actually crossover into the indie blogosphere across releases via limited vinyl pressings rare cd-rs and tapes the groups ten been poorly lumped in with the noise or more perplexingly the hypnagogic pop (groan) scene but for their fourth proper full-length we could probably argue about this but by my count theyre solar bridge on hanson what happened on no fun and the self-titled on wagon and gneiss things the band has served up another reminder that theyre far more interested in the pastoral daydreams kosmische brainy new age and light-krautrock acts like ash ra tempel tangerine dream cluster or jean-michel jarre this time around though have landed on peter rehbergs experimental giant and perhaps expectations have been raised beyond the realm the tape-traders and cleveland catalogue hawks in return the band has fered arguably their sharpest and most short form pop-inclined record to date much the credit for this concision belongs to mark mcguire whose clean emotive guitar work serves to center much the bands sonic escapism opener is slow wistful bliss mcguires gentle lines setting a warm landscape for its entwined synthesizer melodies allows him more wiggle room his guitar soon losing space to the tracks cloudy drones and hushed vocal moans both and the title track are more argento-inspired their shadowy arpeggiated synths almost grinding into energetic guitar parts which sound almost like a car chase (the chaser not the chased) summerdate meanwhile owes its coarse beauty more to the drone/noise atmospheres with which the band was formerly aligned a snowy blast static like bits data forging sound for those whove always liked best when theyve allowed their ideas to unravel beyond the ten-minute mark though theres album centerpiece opens with a pulsating analog synth melody and ascendant vocals that sound like the closing hymn from a much distant church resounding rejoicing and mourning all at once before mcguires slippery gottsching-indebted guitar anchors its psychedelic swirl and yet even as it pushes into the dense wanderlusts their past theres a distinct concern for melody consider it a fitting recombination the bands pensive somewhat academic epics and im here s commitment to more digestible nuggetry whether their fourth is the album that finally propels beyond the small insular circles fed by noise and vintage analog gear fans is yet to be seen but its their best to date in an already impressive catalogue and my god that oughta add up to something right
welcome and bienvenue this is another noisy slice of ed banger branded electro as ubiquitous these days as timberland boots eb couldn t be trendier right now unless it was sponsored by the i hone and brought to you in hd hindsight the labels world domination always seemed destined to happen right from the off the artwork the rock influences the snug denim et al were all about defining an all encompassing indie accessible aesthetic something which ed banger proved very very astute at unfortunately maintaining such a conscious brand takes a lot of effort artists and sounds must fit the mold otherwise you risk having fans turn on you for a brand manager the kiss of death is dylan goes electric artistic waywardness but clamp down too tightly and you end up with just more of the same which is the problem with this compilation o many tracks here adhere to the generic fuzzy skuzzy ed banger sound this is a transient album one track follows another without any semblance of cohesion effect is schizophrenic: one minute you ve got puerile attitude riddled lyrics ( s ) the next unremarkable and gloopy electro ( s minuteman s ulse ) the next death rock curdles that would make a young girl cry (sebastian s ) s telling that these tracks which are the worst here are the most recognizably ed banger retro lazy ass swagger of however requires a little more attention rotect is analogue laced hip hop not just a straight up banger and all the more interesting for it same goes for s : more delicate than anything else here it has a cartoon tension which swells until airy riffs surf high on a proggy wave of electro gushing uncontrollably forth to become no doubt a big summer hit urgency of s the p with its undulating bassy stomps and lofty synth lines is decent too proving that there is still quality within ed banger s ranks ow is a glimpse at the label s enduring potential an inquisitive window of glitchy frequencies and vocoders which lure you in and really hit the spot re s a pattern emerging isn t there more intricate tracks the ones that stray from the typical ed banger blueprint are the standouts seems the less ed banger pursue their particular indie/dance brand the more creativity they allow the artists place of originality of course is loudness: your overall impression is of an instantly gratifiying in your face wall of noise lack of subtlety never stopped a pop song from reaching the top of the charts however and no doubt the relentless of ed rec vol iii will strike a chord with many
weve heard plenty about computers enabling electronic musics dive into maximalism lately but the second release from stands adamantly opposed to the trend both aesthetically and emotionally while tropical cruize her 12-inch debut for l i e s embodied that labels in-from-the-fog sonics s rush hour-released follow-up strips her music to its core: elemental arrangements straightforward moods and relatively sober textures make feel more like a debut than her actual one and one senses something bravely personal in the approach the title cut playfully ominous with its staunchly grim melody and dramatic synth patches certainly wont keep you up at night in the way demdike stare will but it recalls the childlike fear of the unknown were probably all familiar with what evokes is less clear new love new weariness stubborn hangover but with its titular synth taking dead-aim at your heartstrings youll have a hard time not feeling something legowelt s near-constant touring partner this past year and a ubiquitous underground presence as of late adds layers of complexity on his remixes of the originals while plenty of listeners have noted the compatibility of their sounds the results are mixed bizarrely by infusing the track with his own subtle production tricks legowelt strips of its own brand of subtlety taking its weird sort of horror-movie poignancy to a less than desirable b-movie place his take on maintains s mood far better placing it in the seedy nightclub of legowelts dreams without over-milking the originals succulent melodrama
steadily decreasing cd sales have done nothing to stem the tide of long-playing dance albums with the entire industry in its death throes apparently this growing phenomenon is truly baffling meanwhile the fuss over what makes a good dance album continues something of a consensus has formed coherence home-suited listening and thematic concepts are the true virtues of good dance albums although when applied to other genres these values are seen as pretentious and indulgent it s difficult to determine s stance on this hes a bird watcher and park ranger when not making techno and these well-documented details lend themselves easily to conceptual flourish flora and fauna his debut for nailed that label s dreamy aesthetic with its title and cover art alone and his follow-up hemische gefilde went further by inserting short passages of birdsong between the familiar synthetic chugs with hes evidently keen on expressing his digital side possibly a pre-requisite on sven vaths cocoon but thats as coherent as this collection gets despite winning moments suffers like so many albums from context confusion with mood tempo and aggression pitched midway between dancefloor and bedroom it is too restrained to truly excite yet too noisy to calmly enjoy a lot of it sounds like microhouse circa 00 auch farben sutekh or indeed early eulberg with less skitter and heavier drums opens to billowing clouds of pop ambient seductiveness before the percussion modestly takes hold fruchte lets anxious steam jets and metallic screeches offset equally precious tone arrangements haifischflugel lazily scatters pebbles across marimbas while a floor-tom violently bangs weaves garbled stutter around woodblocks rock drums and the crunching of leaves underfoot and gathers all these elements in micro-doses building them into a form of pseudo-trance minus crescendo these gushing moments recur throughout but never make a grand entrance; theyre usually subsumed by the processed organic samples crushed and maimed into incoherent yet pretty aural funk individually theres little here to criticise but en masse it seems somewhat superfluous nothing on equals what eulberg can do with a ; ngc 0 for example off his latest workout with regular collaborator gabriel ananda is absurdly simple and hugely rewarding the tracks on meanwhile seem awkward and overworked a haphazardly assembled collection of the more finished moments from eulbergs harddrive stick to his -inches or his never-dull live sets
by now has his career down like clockwork his label spits out reliable tech house at a steady clip he drops a new mix almost every single week and since 2013 hes released one new 12-inch every year these tracks are essentially sleeker versions of what made wink famous: acid-streaked house with big breakdowns follows in the footsteps of recent wink tracks like balls and talking to you which means an unfussy pulse an endlessly repeating vocal sample (the cringeworthy live in the future ) and a lush breakdown the real treat is the gradual crescendo that bathes the second half of the track in sumptuous chords but it comes a little too late in the otherwise stoic tune to really make a mark a dacid features winkian acid lines and subdued as they are all they really do is dampen the impact of the breakdown more interesting is the which trades out the swooning chords for a pulsating progression that hardens into a steelier kind of techno all three versions are solid but theyre lacking that special something of winks best music
although the label claims that all the music on this ep was recorded in chicago between 1990 and 1996 rumour has it that is yet another pseudonym for dutch producer nny wolfers aka legowelt whats unquestionable is that whoever made traxx 2 has managed to soundtrack a sleazy after-hours warehouse party where trannies ravers puffa jacket-wearing dealers and ladies of the night all congregate is powered by a ferocious bass and wild piano keys as a panting voice claims ill do anything for your love theres also a strong whiff of fornication on but this time its a male vocal making suggestive grunts as gritty drums and wiry acid sounds provide a demented backing isnt the kind of music youd play your granny either with breathy post-coital intonations set against eerie synth sequence and a lopsided groove finally n in sees the narrator do a shout out over creepy organ riffs but seeing as only first names are mentioned its hard to tell if these are producers who inspired or more intimate acquaintances given the kind of carnal shenanigans that preceded it i know what id put my money on
s a house collective exploring the outer limits of the form has a lot in common with regelbau sex tags and sued each label seems like a wormhole of aliases and collaborations you get the sense that these respective crews spend so much time together that they can make a record with whoever happens to be in the room s first full length seems to reflect this approach uckley is the most well known producer on hes made music for rush hours no label offshoot including a split release with olmo devin who goes by s tracks are attributed to a range of new aliases including whos technician and s where someone mumbles through a vocoder establishes s foundations of house dub and krautrock next cut devins channels the deep mysterious funk of on corner era miles davis s excellent combines rhythmic and ethereal rhodes with a baggy breakbeat splitting the difference between stone roses and trip hop other highlights include s pacos which builds up from pensive kraut y percussion into a madcap house groove ive never heard a cut like s which nails the neu sound using a synth pulse and funky harmonica samples hour plus compilation has a mixtape feel re are radio shout outs ( ) and off the cuff jams ( and ) fter s electro via orb track returns with the albums closer s a spacey mid tempo jam that cribs the language of unabashedly dumb 90s alternative rock were leaving school / ill miss my friends / we party hard / but now its the end this boozy ode to camaraderie goes some way to summing up the compilations appeal on bsolute apply a lighthearted touch to an impressive range of styles
following cosmin nicolae through his unusually winding career has been fun from his 2-step feats on hessle audio to his dubstep throwdowns on subway to his bulldozing garage turn on tempa hes now flourishing in is his most recent guise making (mostly) techno on modeselektors label i use the word mostly because nicolaes version of techno is hardly purist with snatches of colour lashing out from his tunes and garage influences popping up in the form of a very slight swing opener drizzles synth melodies on top of a warehouse calibre kick the garage influence comes in the form of the flit and the flutter around those kicks making the beefy 4/4 sound a whole lot more complex than it really is similar to ou to scribbles between the lines with meandering chords and throws in an exuberant melody not too far off from the 2-step revival hes since distanced himself from the record also abandons the idea of techno as purely marathon bouts of repetition the longest tracks on are just upwards of five minutes and most of the record is divided into easily digestible chunks the albums back half sees an influx of choppy idm-indebted rhythms: for instance sounds like sepalcure crossed with classic afx while the slight shift of gears is at first jarring the diversity only makes the album stronger indeed every track is packed to the brim with personality its hard to imagine the ever-twinkling ou or the phased panicked mania of coming from anyone else fittingly the album ends not in drifting waves of ambience or an epic blow-out but instead with another fidgety four minute techno flail stays grounded and focused on pumping out techno-tinged bangers (with brief interludes) for 45 minutes it also happens to be the best music of his career so far its impossible to guess where hell go next but with this kind of track record we can probably expect it to be nothing short of fantastic
more than most labels is a family affair was originally inspired by a short-lived club of the same name in weimar germany and in the years since then has taken on very few artists from beyond its original crew gilles aiken the berlin producer better known as is one of those artists formerly a staple of the label white hes now one of s key producers thanks to a string of records that both embody and expand on the labels introspective sound his lp from last year into a better future was a surreal tapestry of kosmische ambient and leftfield house his latest 12-inch shows this eccentric sound further taking shape aikens music is informed by a rich pool of psychedelic influences something we know from his ra podcast but that you could guess from listening to this ep part shoegaze part perlon-style microhouse the record is hazy and bittersweet as a half-remembered dream s title tracks billowing percussion has an aptly avian sense of motion: coasting fluttering weaving though it follows a steady groove it feels like an unpredictable swarm of sounds especially in its beatless and chaotic closing section (for my money the best part of the record) the other tracks are a bit housier rides a bright childlike melody that feels of a piece with the image on the records cover (that sun by the way is hand-painted on every copy) is a shimmering mass of drum patterns and trippy loops and quite groovy despite having no kick drum at face value is by-the-books deep house but as with the rest of this record the richness of its textures and the depth of its emotion make it something much more than that
as the proverbial adage says those who cant play music write about it instead but if i had the talent (and the will) a large swathe of work is what id want my own stuff to sound like needless to say then the release of - energies richard fearless first album in seven years had me waiting with trepidation thankfully the album is quite possibly his most stirring and accomplished work to date whereas fearless (and his old affiliate tim holmes) used various guests to add warmth to their productions from fragile (dot allison hope sandoval woodbines susan dillane) or domineering (adult s nicola kuperus) female vocalists to strongly individualistic rock roll daddies (paul weller bobby gillespie iggy pop or well liam gallagher) this new album sees the main man get behind the microphone at first fearless voice may sound juvenile and green but it perfectly fits its intimate surroundings from the get-go the albums confessional tone is set by : its soft fade-in recalls spiritualized at their most heart-breaking and distressed while the she left me lyrical mantra is made more poignant by some delicate banjo (yes banjo) plucking in contrast evokes bloody valentines immersive shoegaze while could just as easily have been titled teenage lust producers often go back to the music that shaped their adolescence and in - energies case you can clearly hear the jesus and mary chain lurking in the background during its nosier guitar-drenched moments yet it never sounds dated or pointlessly retro: somehow it all fits only with third track are we offered a first hint of proper electro la hands around throat katie stelmanis of austra guests her operatic coo complementing fearless perverse acidic tweaks she shows up again on which doesnt veer far away from austras own aesthetics; it reminds of their song spellwork albeit with a less glossy sheen on these two cuts fearless take on synthetic pop is weirdly lo-fi and synths are made to sound exhausted yet strangely humane the same can be said about and which both recall spiritualizeds fragile universe again with fearless trading the gospel choir and bombastic arrangements for minor pads and misshapen distorted melodies the self-explanatory offers the same kind of warped ambience while coming across as a satan circus outtake as does most of the instrumental material made available on a second limited edition cd older fans might feel more comfortable with these even though its obvious wants to take them elsewhere with the album proper this is never more evident than on the albums closing duo / the former a cavernous and restless go at new-wave-like indie-rock noir built around a stomping bassline a reverberating moog and an evanescent guitar riff the latter a slow-motion yet conquering rumbling anthem that bursts into a jubilant and orchestral display of white noise its a fitting end to a truly striking album
munichs recordings label has become one of the most understatedly refined disseminators of a strain of techno thats growing more popular seemingly by the minute the recent cio dor resident advisor podcast is an excellent mascot for this kinda-sorta-movement concerned as much with bewitching sound design as anything else long enamored with the darker more surrealist end of techno tracks on tend to be sparse and minimal (the good kind) with spooky and tense atmospheres that stretch out and unfold over ten minutes each track is a journey in itself on his second release for the label japanese producer dabbles in the more ambient end of s imagined stylebook is almost like a characteristic take on aphex twins most comforting early compositions: think donato dozzy stuck inside of selected ambient works 85-92 the decaying ambient wash gives way to under-the-surface tribal thrumming which continues unabated through the several layers of dry ice haze and clouds of intoxicating detritus that floats by during the tracks gorgeous ten minutes probes darker realities it central riff grinding on its own axis with little variation outside of the silvery sparks that shoot out of unseen corners however its the title track that hews closest to s greatest talent--check his spaciotemporal white label on phonica for another fine example--that is packing this vast ambient expanse of dread tension and sensuality into sharply-focused beats on percussive synths vibrate internally their invisible but palpable motion intensifying into a concentrated sheet of simultaneous unnatural movements the frantic shaking like planetary orbits forced into tiny straight lines if s got the power to move heavenly bodies imagine what these tracks could to do a dance floor
the duo of pablo valentino and steven joyce ames made their debut last year with an ep for bonzzaj but most will recognize them as having contributed the d-side to motor city drum ensembles excellent mcde 1206-07 doublepack a tip from mcde is a pretty solid one to have right now and now (loving you) was enough of a highlight that you may have marked their next release as one to check youll be pleased that you did: while offering nothing mindblowingly unexpected from house music csas subtly psychedelic take on the deep stuff is certainly worth your time like mcde csa deal in thick percussive loops simple yet supple chord progressions and the vaguely live feel of so many moodymann tracks opener does this best showing they have the confidence to let the combination positively simmer and a woman s both whip the evening into shape at a somewhat faster clip and while very well executed theres honestly not much distinguishing these deep house tune from plenty of others; james s remix of on the flip with more nuanced chords and nimbler production takes the idea just a bit further
barcelona-based net and vinyl label has to date served up a steady fare of dub techno goodness to rival the likes of baum styrax and millons of moments but their new green vinyl 12-inch from berliner ismail genc aka makes most on the dub techno menu seem like meat and two veg compared to this sumptuous three course meal for starters serves up a rich flowing tapestry of dance floor dub techno flavoured with multiple layers of beautifully worked bass production that comes and goes in the mix as much as the steaming runs of echo the contrast of acid pads and steely chords near the tracks end is an extra touch of class for the main course the epic drifts into being slowly unfurling about a driving kick drum theres a sweet menace in the flutter of percussion and the incessant lure of the low chords when at full flight with even a hint of dubstep over the main 4/4 luke s dessert is the perfect accompaniment to the main meal minimally styled and thus lighter to digest it nonetheless captures the same urgent taste of the original patiently building in intensity it rounds off a delirious feast

sven schienhammer has been a busy man of late as well as this ep there has been a spate of remixes another ep on meanwhile and the super-limited and sold-out mini-album thousands of thoughts all in the last month or so so where has all this inspiration come from one might be tempted to say a certain madness thousands of thoughts indeed the emotional landscape of this ep suggests some dark forces at work in the mind of for example is teeming with rage with metallic chords smashing into each other impatiently for the full eight minutes couple this with percussion that sounds like a whip and you have a dub techno soundtrack to frustration the only problem is it needs a little bit of something else like a breakdown a bigger percussive drive or a frenetic drone rising from the inside to fully unleash all of that intensity doesn t let go either inverting the original by dropping the pace a little to open up a gulf of space and lift the lovely bass melody to the surface but even that space seems heavy here physically denying the dub chords of the original by pulling them down into an echoing oblivion as soon as they emerge positively remorseful stuff but beautifully executed this version is perhaps even better than the original despite being much further from the dance floor is dives even deeper into a downward spiral more ambient yet still heavy it is the soundtrack to a burn out with power chords attempting to break through a flickering and phased white noise overall struck is a dark unforgiving and unmissable 12-inch from

next up on the vibrant is a release from and the remixes of koukou le first up is a very nice jori hulkkonen remix that sees the sound of africa in this track converted to a retro acid house number it works quite well with the african style vocals uniting quite well with the acid riffs and smooth piano lines and the vocal does play a nice vital role especially deep into the track the jori hulkkonen dub strips the vocal mix pretty much of the uplifting vibes and keeps it a deep techy and acid based underground cut it s quite a nice compliment to the very nice summery vocal mix the acid kings remix keeps the acid vibe going with a pretty chunky reworking here the beats are a little stronger here and the feel again on a techy acid vibe the vocal also gets a pretty good editing the end result making them sound a little more gritty much like the acid riffs as the track progresses very good stuff here on f com with the jori mixes standing out for me

detroit producer has made some inspirational techno music either as part of los hermanos or on his own including an impressive debut on his own historia y violencia label last year may not rank as his most subtle work: it centres on a soaring electronic bassline that threatens to but never quite succeeds in drowning out the subtle melodic flourishes that have become his trademark but its smart arranging and rich sounds are unmistakably salazars unfortunately the remix by stefan promises great things but falls victim to its creators whims sounding like los hermanos or vintage carl craig its raw shuffling drums and hissing shaking percussion create the perfect environment for the introduction of mellow acoustic guitar riffs and spacey chords its at this point that introduces the new ge pan pipes they sound hideously out of place but it gets worse as sian plinky plonk textures join the arrangement to steer the remix into an ambient finale that could be the combined soundtrack to the dueling dwarves in the stonehenge scene in spinal tap and a love scene in a japanese martial arts movie in short an unfortunate choice of samples has ruined a potentially excellent remix to paraphrase lake axter: stefan : what happened
after making a great showing on the bedrock label with all i want morgan page returns with astrid suryanto at his side with this latest release on entitled the original mix is first up and it is in the same vein as his original mix of all i want smooth beats combined with delicate guitar riffs combine effortlessly with the soothing smooth vocals of astrid the track flows very nicely throughout without any real breakdowns except late on in the piece pretty solid as always this is a smooth production that doesn t necessarily try to much but succeeds in what it does first up on the flip is the dub mix and as the name suggests many of the vocals are lost in this mix as it focuses on the guitar riffs as well as the electro baseline effects some of the vocals are cut up and used to good effect creating another solid production with this mix following this is the acoustic mix which is essentially a down tempo version delicate slow beats roll nicely with the smooth baseline as well as the guitar riffs the vocals are definitely the highlight of this mix as they are spotlight and don t get lost in the beats not a bad release by morgan page but one can t help but feel it doesn t have the allure that the release on bedrock had and does indeed still have with the forthcoming mixes don t be fooled though it is a solid release and it really showcases the vocal talents of astrid suryanto

this is the first 12-inch of a new series from called wilderness sessions idea is that it will diverge from the labels usual dance floor focus and meander off into areas such as ambient and jazz who have recently released eps on off minor and rush hour touch on both ambient and jazz for their contribution to the series with a little broken-beat and trip-hop also in the mix is the releases energetic highlight with a languorous female vocal wafting around little bass nudges and freeform snare hits is a filmic ambient-jazz wash of pads clicking percussion and shimmering pianos while on the flip is a coiled-spring amalgam of druggy acidic bass pads and claps s central feature is a perky bassline thats supported by jazzy keys it all makes for a stylish start to a series that should be worth keeping tabs on
as far as acid puns go is among the most unfortunate names given to an album and the latest excursion into slow sentimental 303 sequences from chameleonic berliner lives up to its title all too well these ten tracks carry the torch left by their spiritual predecessor 2012s languid on acid but now the flame seems to have fizzled out its true that acid in the wrong hands can come off as gimmicky or trite yet the genres zippy sounds are imbued with wild infectious energy by default so s central problem stems from the fact that once the dreary concept inevitably grows monotonous and yes placid theres nary a satisfying squelch or quick-footed 808 for it to fall back on the techy stuff winds up the most disappointing and meander through polite rimshots bass prods and tangles of yowling synth tones without ever figuring out how to make them all interesting likewise teases lofty payoffs with its wide filter sweeps but reneges on the excitement and reverts to its mid-tempo schlepp worse still is how it ends on a groovy drum machine shuffle that comes from out of nowhere those last 20 seconds are far livelier than the preceding five minutes and sorely missed when theyre gone from his quagmire of elongated reverb-soaked 303 whines and cushy 4/4 patterns pulls out a few keepers he teams with on and together the trio conjures some depth and vitality with subtle percussion the glow of distant pads and a remarkably sensitive touch you could imagine richard d james fiddling with similar ideas in the early 90s its also a reminder of what helped make on acid an interesting experiment three years ago: texture and variety doesnt value the finer details nearly as much as an album this monochrome should with their low-swung rhythms and hooky melodies and make smart use of s patient acid but even the slightest trace of fresh unfamiliar sounds wouldve made them really pop
if dublin isnt somewhere that springs to mind when someone asks where to find the freshest contemporary hip-hop perhaps its about time starts getting noticed as the european stable for slickly off-kilter beatsmiths counting flying lotus mike slott and hudson mohawke amongst recent alumni the label now turn to to deliver their first full-length offering is the latest excursion the enigmatic parisian 2007s charmingly overlooked full-length chinoiseries he focused his attentions on vietnamese pop vinyl time around he takes on a wholly different starting point: 90s hip-hop and 80s electro miami vice -style cover evokes the technical wonder associated with the digital dawn of the 80s a decade whose slink and upfront romance have recently been reimagined for the dance floor by the likes of alexander nut dam-funk and funkineven like those names s chrome soul is well-oiled enough to embrace plenty of todays technical fetishes too not least the chunked-out bass and percussive whack of contemporary dubstep on show in cca what sounds on paper like an impossible mesh of styles is held together by an overarching hip-hop sensibility true to his earlier material s latter half synthetic wibbles are anchored to a subterranean rustie-esque bassweight elsewhere nestles epic guitar wailing within throbbing low-slung glitch forging a connection somewhere between prefuse 73 and prince saunters up for vocal duties on the harmonised drama of turning on a bizarre 90s boy band insecurity with lines such as i know you seen me standin there / tryina catch your eye / watchin you for quite some time / ut you think im an average guy following up these moments with cheap mating calls like dont wanna come regular wanna show you a whole new thang might be unashamedly tacky but thats the point like the most successful schmucks at the disco has his tongue loosely embedded in his cheek and its exactly what saves him getting slapped result is bizarre satisfyingly nostalgic and outmoded romantic tact something the most sophisticated r lover will testify works as well today as it did under the roller-disco glitterballs of the 80s indeed most of seems to be concerned with loss and the vain search for monogamous love s is on the lookout for the e in um e oliver s performance on the title track drips with enough vandross-esque pathos to lay out a genuine sense of hopeless devotion to his lucky lady ut thanks to some subtle production skills and careful attention to detail is able to tease out the smallest hint of irony the albums most romantic moments sliding a slight warp over s slick croon were asked to remember that we are after all stiff-lipped modern listeners who shouldnt be weakened by such cheesy sap or should we s source materials are woven together convincingly but as a complete package the barrage can get a bit distracting at times turning up misfires like the dull electro pulse of chanical though and casually step on the toes of flying lotus and the recent thriller series they do little more than give a nod to their triumphs and never commit too much to making a proper challenge to each respective crown ut given s undeniable charm these problems are easily forgiven s finest achievements are entirely successful attempts at slopping a bit of greasy love and boogie onto our dance floors and lets face it weve all been secretly missing those lost moments smooching under the disco lights
earlier this year aka simon aussell described glide his year-old ep for as a creative breakthrough i feel free to experiment [with] a lot of different things right now he told inverted audio referring mostly to his musics expanding tempo range he seemed especially liberated on glide s obi a 100-bpm creep with glass-shard melodies and echo ppler a light-speed roller from this years pogdance both are distinct from the bassy polyrhythmic techno of his mostly k-based peers from pour le club aussells scope widens again its fast (160 bpm) prickly (thanks to its fast-twitch percussion) and hard to pin down the doomy sci-fi synths gesture to late 90s drum bass but the tuned bass drums and lack of breaks bring a fresh perspective intello mix of is the other highlight of the four tracks here it sounds most like a high-spec belter with surgical sound design counter-intuitive syncopations and icy arps other tracks less successfully echo this sound bass drones and subtle drum delays make worthwhile but the gated wail on the original mix of isnt compelling enough to lift an overly familiar drum pattern
from the moment that starts chugging into your speakers you cant help but think that it sounds exactly like love vs distance xel wilners debut single from four years ago s this a problem depends on what you expect when an artist resurfaces after a phenomenal success whether its jackson pollock raymond chandler or kraftwerk every artist with a signature style faces a tough choice: you give the people what they want or try something new n this case thankfully wilner chooses the former route and faithfully follows his playbook of churning drums and white noise fueled by the tension of tightly clipped loops punctuated by the occasional guitar lick or extra bar of melody never gives you much breathing room: his tracks are awash in layers of white noise and frosted with ethereal vocals in this case borrowing from the cocteau twins lorelei thomas s remix isnt frantic at all with a couple of knocking drums clears away the claustrophobia of the original shaping it into something brighter more optimistic and much closer to the slow gallop of his own productions once the vocals start spinning at the halfway mark however the track becomes very much a field record same thing with the foals remix : despite reorganizing the track into proper movements of stripped-down breaks and a full-tilt chorus those gauzy vocals and fizzy loops keep the track firmly fenced within wilners sun-drenched landscape play these three tracks in a row and they work like one epic song neither nor the foals transform the original into something new they just recolor it a little bit which speaks to the persistence of wilners fingerprints s grinds along keep thinking of a pollock painting: the unmistakable style thats a little overheated those swirling and tangled threads with colors burning at the edges and m happy that he made so many versions in slightly different sizes and colors

had a stunning debut year in 2010 creating and riding a wave of new interest in grime particularly instrumental grime perfectly timed with the resurrection (or rather rediscovery) of grime kingpin terror danjah label has established an already recognizable brand of synth music made of bright primary colours tunes that place as much of an emphasis on songwriting and playful jocularity as they do on club-ready beats ir first release of is the first full-fledged release for - the young london producer of 1up fame 2009 track was grime at its most dramatic and humourous mixing faux-orchestral pomp with video game sound effects its a chiptune aesthetic that has taken to heart with many of their signature producers (swindle src mr mitch) building tunes out of the resonant and chirpy synths like most of the labels prominent -sides gets its own silly video and the quaint and homespun inanity of the depicted scenes perfectly matches its tinny grandiosity and irreverent nature t its core is an incredibly simple (but effective) tune based around a whining two-note progression that stutters and chatters around the bend creating an unforgettable melody out of basic oscillation whole thing is buffeted by a few handclaps and sometimes even a stray hi-hat as if mr is afraid that if he fully completes the tune its going to get up and walk away out of his hands its only when a piano seemingly falls over onto the track at the end muffling its bratty synth that you realize youve been listening to the same two notes over and over again for a whole three minutes dance music at its best and purest tracks on the b-side have a hard time living up to the head-rush heights of but theyre just as fascinating and almost as infectious devil mix of takes the structural minimalism of to a challenging new extreme as it lacks a bassline outside of a few grumbling synth notes and a kick drum dissonant chords dinky rimshots and those same poor wandering hi-hats dance around hesitantly carefully avoiding all the spots where the kick would go; its a disorienting bit of trickery that transforms the sampled refrain of music please from gruff bravado to just plain pleading on the contrary the bouncy exuberance of seems to burst out of the withered skin of its exhausted predecessor nicely wearing -ts vaunted garage influence on his orange-stained sleeve in truth its somewhere between old-school eski uk funky and garage but its all - as a whistling refrain tumbles down jagged steps and a gurgling bass synth coughs up monotonous melodies monotony can be good and as - strips his sound down to the basics he proves himself almost as adept as a primitive pop auteur as he is grime producer nd thats really what is all about: pop and circumstance no pomp necessary

gitated industrial friction slowly disperses where amidst this parsed out recording you sense deconstruction in the delicate play of static perhaps its a field recording of rain a name synonymous with sound work often coalescing within its worldly physical structures brings out the deeper reflection in at the of the from the three lp box set things dont sit still for long blasts of percussive clanging rattle in the background as if someone is rummaging for something in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere what just happened res a discourse of struggle perhaps akin to a midlife crisis to stare at blankly ll along a digital warble pairs with bloated bearings a whirring battle that shakes and skips striating the vignetted chaos into flyby rhythmic pattering finally things end with a note a one-string twang that echoes in a whispery drone in the dead of silence one is left in the bare open space of contemplation having seen colley perform while sitting on the floor in a vast room this set has a very similar live/performative feel to it his intimate process with old school equipment handheld random objects and a few random effects boxes is obvious we are witnesses in the cadence of the crispy sound of electricity thing sinister looms but it conjures up more curiosity than evil spirits buzz leads to feedback and gentle mashing sounds with a layer of radio interference between parts two and three its hard to tell if something is being ruptured cranked out or in the process of being soldered or repaired its a bit of a brazen blur foreground vanishes on or s of as the background bleeds closer perceptually you may be listening to something moving forward in space some type of mechanism just churning away but we are kept at a somewhat safe distance blur of a low decibel drone just lingers and pulsates throttle and hiss of with just the hint of a mans laughter and something akin to a mixing machine help to speak its name until the familiar sound of a cutting buzzer (on side 4) is blended with its surface most of colleys instruments here are quite anonymous throughout there are calmer subtle moments between improv and the balance is at times startling silence is unnerving amid all the raucous but again it rarely lasts final thing you hear on this album is a whiney slice of celebration a foreboding collision of razor-like tools scraping hard surfaces paired with the fallout from streaming fireworks
p p bradock is almost impossible to pin down literally friend told me that he recently interviewed him via im and it took him days to finish the thing every time hed send over a question a reply would come back hours later as though he was mulling over the most infuriatingly mysterious way to answer it listening to his music youd expect nothing less bradock is the only artist i know thatd name a 12-inch nd more importantly for the music to sound exactly like the swimsuit issue from 1789 needless to say things are once again a bit odd on of is somewhat surprisingly one of his most infectious recent house numbers bouncing along on a treated synth melody as though it didnt have a care in the world while what sound like masses of birds pop up throughout to pleasantly cloud things up for almost any other producer itd be a revelation ( nd it is another slice of bradock genius ) but you also get the sense that he has reams of this stuff just lying around like b-side opener which has that same mid-tempo house bounce and shivers and shakes as though the whole thing is about to come apart at any moment (thats what analog equipment will give you apparently it isnt raw so much as its refreshingly cheap sounding ) meanwhile lets bradock get his jollies with a green melody line that seems unable to stop quivering smooth pads a bassoon and other assorted wackiness ensure underneath but good luck trying to figure out why even if you got a hold of him im sure youd be left with more answers than questions for some reason though i like it like that
eclectic swiss iranian is (well was) one half of fuckpony and his first cocktail on mathias tanzmann s deep house-turned-minimal imprint moon harbour picks up where his outings on tuning spork and get physical left off: the three tracks here are bass bumpy weird vocal wonders a-side starts off choppy and warm its beats bass and samples grinding well together like loved up kids on the dancefloor i especially like the arrangement on this; it s very human not mathematical at all and the vocal snippets really work to funk up the structure of the track i can t warm to the flipside so much: leads with percussion and bleeps that build to a soft break but it s nowhere near as instant and sonically tight as it should be skks is my pick of the three; this sounds to me like matt john in a good mood: serious jack with stripped down beats and jungle-jangle freaky vocal samples that ll really warm your legs overall s bag of tricks is an appealing one and skks especially recalling haze s and s overlooked project earback; two tracks with soul tight arrangements and a goofiness that ll make you smile
fact that these four vignettes are culled from a live performance in 2001 (apparently at the launch of the label) may give you a rough idea of whats on offer here techno/jazz but its not as easy as all that title track a loose cover of pharoah sanders has a masterplan is the stand-out: the heavily-phased repeated vocal refrain drifting in and out over the simple surging deep keys and classic 909 work the charming variations in level proving the liveness rumours combines classic cocktail jazz keys with intricate percussion and a busy spiraling bassline that if it could get up and walk would to the bar for a martini no doubt cluttered whishes doesnt make sense until the technoid keys overpower the dark bottom end and muted synth while is the most jazz thanks to the delicate keys skipping hats and melancholic ron trent-y bassline live nature of these recordings is both part of the charm hearing the slight variations in levels theyre human after all and part of the problem: yup the music is fantastic but it feels like a glimpse of a techno/jazz promised land of sorts as opposed to the real thing each track drops straight into the action as if record was pressed willy-nilly so it feels like youve walked in on the gig after it started only to be forcibly removed when the music stops dead perhaps vinyl is not the best way to appreciate the live experience any chance of a live album

you know a labels hit its stride when it becomes a talent magnet to wit: lee foss and jamie jones no longer need to release their own jams on for it to prosper their brand of warm tech-y and sex-drenched deep house has taken on a life of its own on waifs strays a ristol duo who saw chart success in the past year with tracks for leftroom and get physical offer a spot-on embodiment of the spirit thats also to say that you can pretty much guess what youre gonna get before the needle drops whats novel about is actually that its fairly fast it takes a characteristically funky wompwomp bass and cranks it up into a breezy clipped pace the fact that doesnt need much more than a good low-end recalls dj legend arthur akers remark about production people dance to the bassline the lyrics are nicely conflicted while theyre ostensibly about sexual attraction theres something about their delivery (whispered and ghostly) which makes their description of a shivering body and a rising temperature somewhat unnerving as the title suggests eat into doubles down on the sex-as-horror theme and with its marble-mouthed goblin voices and crisp drums continues the fashion of tech-y minimal house thats as scary as it is sexy hot s own remix of regards the vocal as a curious plaything time-stretching it and mangling it in a junglistic way foss and jones jack up the tunes implicit housiness and throw some delirious honking sounds in for good measure making me feel a little bit like im at a dance party at chuck e cheese
this is finally out for commercial purchase but what took it so long it s been signed to gu for some time now (i think over half a year but who s counting) i m sure most of us have heard the track by now as it s one of sasha s nick s and just about everyone else s favorite track gu describes this as a meeting of god within and leftfield you must have balls to say something like that i doubt luke chable and phil k would describe it like that your sound better be spiritual unique and above all else quality so do i think that the description fits the bill actually yes i do one of the few times the par can come together as since for the past 24 months each man has quickly become a-list producers and djs touring and remixing tracks for other artist for most of the time doing this has taken away some of their own time to compile and create their first artist album for gu i m hoping they will devote more time to complete the album because is an exquisite insight to what the untitled album will be the track made famous from a play during annie s radio one show back months and months ago by way out west the original mix is progressive breaks to the t wicked breaks mashed up with tribal-like drum patterns and tibetan chants creates a whirlwind of bliss the clam before the storm once those horns blows in you know this sh t is going to be epic to say this is dramatic may be an understatement everything about this track is money from the beaks to the horns and up to the melody the sound that s used to create this rabbit is gorgeous sequencing and arrangement is superb (and you wouldn t expect anything less from these two genus s and btw i an t on their nuts it s just a damn fine track) so then what the hell are you going to do once you have a track that s close to being perfect and you still have one dark side of vinyl left to fill a remix yes but do you think it ll hold up what are you going to do change it all together or strip it apart for dj use well the stoned immaculate mix i can say happily is the latter ambient beat less mixes continue to be a force within progressive music as of late first half is beat less while the second half grows with a slowed down beat from the original this mix is more frozen and still giving this piece an intense awaking in the center of the eye with the reprise of the roots you see the final full length version that was used in electric calm v1 sped up slightly the low pounding snare still works well from the original menacing breakbeat flourishing over those temple vocals adds power the reprise is much harder than the original in my opinion and i think it s a bit funny that this version was used in an ambient album a very good release off back-to-back with trafik (they also have an artist album for gu coming up as well) for all you sasha and nick admires you get the original for all you experimental and creative djs out there you get the ambient mix and for everyone who loved or missed the first release of the roots you get a special reprise to find out what the fuss was about the track sweet and sassy all around a1: (original mix) b1: ( s stoned immaculate mix) b2: the roots (reprise)
arkestral label hark back to the mid 90s era of drum bass and jungle encapsulated in their motto of respecting the 170 bpm speed limit on this release instra:mental and d take those aesthetics in two different directions the electro bliss of and and the harder distorted soundscapes of and etuned beautiful opens with poignant ]shifting synths that stutter in and out of tune as if they were broken archaic machines; despite these disharmonic shifts though the melody makes sense and progresses gracefully within the framework of the song features similar elements with floating and evocative synth riffs layered over harmonic pads and a steady beat both these tracks eschew the kick snare breakbeat patterns that have come to signify drum bass and in turn seem much slower than they really are coupled with simple but gorgeous melodies and a smattering of inaudible vocal samples and field recordings these tunes evoke memories of i m just as much as they bring drum bass to mind other half of this release however is drum bass pure and simple in stark synths feature over a two step beat the heaviness of which makes it seem much slower than it actually is a growling and menacing bassline appears out of nowhere and the tune progresses in a minimalist vein with ticking hi hats resounding drum hits and synth pads playing with the foundational elements of the simple beat and snarling distorted bass etuned operates in similar territory the core ingredients being a slow rolling reese bassline filtered up and down over a steppy beat and a vocal sample that seems half sarcastic preaching the arrival of a techno utopia over the rigid and machine like bleakness of the backing track nothing particularly new is being done in these two tracks in fact youd even be forgiven for mistaking for a remix of the 1997 tech step anthem quadrant six by om and optical but instra:mental and d sidestep about ten years of evolution (or devolution depending on who you ask) in the harder end of drum bass ir open and spacious analogue sound is a breath of fresh air and a diversion from the over compressed ultra loud sound that dominates modern productions in this drum bass subgenre a place where production values and engineering skills sometimes seem to be valued over ideas or musical content
emerging little more than a year ago with a wickedly off-kilter debut for hessle udio has since been responsible for some of dubsteps most idiosyncratic transmissions melding gloopy half-step rickety garage and oddball electronica to striking effect it was only a matter of time before hotflush caught up with him and the results are impressive -side sees buoyant elasticized stabs of bass pegged down by a tight 2-step shuffle ripple jubilantly amidst a sprawl of vaporous rolando-esque atmospherics gone are the jittery semi-schizoid mannerisms of previous works replaced by an altogether breezier set of dynamics that signal a shift towards sunnier climes notably the painful introversion characteristic of so much recent ukg-flavoured dubstep is conspicuous in its absence it comes as a welcome change takes things further into detroit-inspired territory sounding not unlike delano smith given a uk underground makeover uilt around a brittle kick/rimshot play-off warm subs and molten chords bubble incandescently in the background seemingly unfazed by the clattering percussion and happy to pause here and there for breath dreamy female vocals only add to the carefree ambience much like the -side its a quietly confident piece imbued with a healthy sense of perspective and in no great hurry to impress anyone s such its just marvellous
pe r mannerfelt and malcolm pardon arent lacking ambition the swedish duos new album as is the third in a series thats chronicled the full sweep of western civilisation over the last two centuries from the agrarian existence evoked on their self-titled but through the dustrial revolution on 2011s dust to the late-capitalist society of f that sounds like an epic documentary series their music is the soundtrack to match and now more so than ever with their usual piano and synth set-up augmented by a 26-piece string ensemble yet in addition to being a concept album is in some ways also a protest record t might not have any of the folksy ballads of the 60s but it does articulate a similar anger and spair at the inequalities of a society riven by both internal conflict and foreign wars ts also the latest in a number of recent electronic albums that al with the topic of war although with the possible exception of s martial drumming and whirring helicopters it doesnt address the subject matter as directly as say vatican shadows kneel before religious cons which focused on the war on terror or ben frosts a u r o r a recor d in the war-torn democratic republic of congo nor is it as intense as either of those records although the savage shows can bear ferocious teeth when they want to stead the spectre of war is conjured as an encroaching threat on tracks like where the beats sound like distant bombs and the piano notes feel like glowing embers blowing in the wind ts equal parts dark and light these two elements intermingling to create an ambivalent set of emotions from gnawing fear to brief tranquillity as unnerving and uncertain as you imagine life in a war zone might be this isnt music of stark contrasts instead it has the soft grainy feel of old black and white footage despite its contemporary inspiration the era most brings to mind is europe between the two world wars especially the neo-classical gran ur of the strings on which swell around the titular instrument being played with the contemplative aura of harold budd yet like that of 1930s europe its an uneasy and transient peace one which soon disintegrates beneath the zombie march of which feels like the machines of war rising once more from a fitful slumber clearly this story isnt over yet
jack dunning is that rare thing: a reliably chameleonic producer not fickle so much as engaged in a hit-and-run exercise dropping in on pockets of latent creativity raiding them for all the brilliance theyve got and moving on before most people have worked out what the fucks going on s a practice its the very definition of avant-garde: hunting out the new even perhaps at the expense of your own identity; constantly presaging scenes and sounds without ever settling fully into their embrace maybe thats just the romantic modernist in me coming through though has played a part in s explorations before: 2010s stereo freeze for r s saw dunning sculpt angry gloopy buzzing beasts in the image of the labels early 90s output this latest run of singles however feels like the product of a far more involved engagement with techno with change in a dynamic environment ep 1 released back in pril the producer stretched things out almost to breaking point relying on hypnotic dehumanising plateaus of energy rather than vertiginous impact; the exquisite agony of the slow build in place of the shock-and-awe immediacy of say 2009s naconda ep 2 ploughs a similar furrow: simultaneously very familiar in its deployment of the conventions of peak time techno and yet fascinatingly unusual in a way you cant quite place is mostly kick drums each one rolling the length of some cavernous warehouse space before falling into the arms of its successor surprisingly barefaced melodic line supplies the narrative gradually consumed by squalls of synthetic detail that rise and fall unendingly reathe is crisper more reserved dawn light peeking tentatively through poorly-covered windows that doesnt mean the climax is any less confrontational though bursts of scuttling hi-hats throw your feet off balance while serene pads eventually become volatile rearing up to saturate the mix
some releases are nice in that they can be summarised in a single phrase or even just a word in the case of s latest offering that word is careful the first of two originals is a watery cut its submerged pieces prevented from interacting too harshly winds several layers together and apart shifting them like imperceptible currents weighty kick and tumbling resonant synth are the most solid elements anchoring the rest firmly sven weisemanns remix is gentler and trades the watery feel for a dry metronomic quality this version is filled with hints of pad and swooshes sounds which never reveal themselves fully the payoff comes in the percussion; a sort of speedbump just after halfway rustling cymbals overpower their diminuitive cohorts but when they disappear for the final two minutes everything seems drab in comparison is very much a b-side to ; the same in form and function here the watery synths have a different finish though; a glistening oily sheen its not so certain of its destination either where its sibling track surges forward dragging everything commandingly in its wake meanders along inspecting things here and there before returning to the safe path like the rest of the ep however its entirely too polite too clinical this kind of care is always admirable but only when its accompanied by a spark
the 11th release on is the courtesy of aka phil kaulfuss phil was the man responsible for the cosmos vs daft punk bootleg last year but this time he turns in 3 delicious productions of his very own to please the punters on the a-side is the title track robofunk the track begins with some subdued beats as the main kick soon comes in it is quite an energetic production from the word go with some nice drums and a good baseline underneath while the beats continue to pound subtle vocal lines come in and out as do funky sound effects it maintains a good flow throughout and is definitely a quality production firstly on the flip is perfunktory it begins with some tribal oriented beats but soon enough we are introduced to a large wobbly baseline that literally takes control smooth sounds surround the production until the track breaks down unleashing the smooth synthy effects another quality track following this is just a dub more then just a dub this track has substance the beats flow while the smooth rough synths chug along in the background the production breaks down deep into the track allowing for a small melodic interlude before the main driving loop kicks back in a great ep from the not resting on his laurels phil has delivered 3 tracks each with elements that stand out on their own be sure to give this a listen next time you go record shopping

is matt cantor and aston harveys new project for krafty kuts records if you havent heard of these guys before does the name the freestylers ring a bell yep its the same two dudes and theyve just come out with a f**kin corker of a vinyl thats sure to rock any dancefloor and they arent being subtle about it at all these guys are side a punks punks has a bass line that is so familiar the original track just seems to escape the tip of my tongue and is a really tough hard arsed breaks tune once that bass line kicks in you can be sure everyone in the place will cheer their approval let the beats thump side b demon beats theres no stopping these boys with the wicked tunes and this time its a breakstep (breaks and 2-step) track with a bit of jbs sampled horns on the top one for both the breaks crowd and also a 2-step crowd i dont really see anything wrong with either track so it gets a full score nice
is at the centre of a new wave of producers from germanys rhine-main area and his productions routinely rank among the best in a busy market evans worked at one of frankfurts key record stores freebase until its closure last year he then moved to its spiritual successor gosu which has a label that is four releases deep then theres pager records another label evans runs with markus sommer needless to say evans is busy he might be fresh blood but raum musik represents frankfurts old guard where the playful quirks of the former are balanced by the steady flow of the latter shows their common ground the title track is surprisingly tender for evans hes played with these moods before but nervous bleeps have cloaked their vulnerability the higher of the two lead lines in recalls mika vainios philus project with the purity of its tone and drifting pitch and reverb foreboding chords contribute to the trepidation but the heavily swinging drums and bass make the track inviting its spacious by evans standards but is sucked tight like a vacuum the low-end is very low and although its lead line and chords offer hints of classic house warmth its also stripped and focused evans can make tracks with more flair but this eps restraint is striking
enthusiastic reviews of were all agreed: this was more than just a remix album jamie xx had leapt from the brackets behind the track titles to take joint credit for a project as much his vision as that of the original artist he stitched together tracks from im -herons comeback album with samples of the singers earlier work other classics and outtakes from xx sessions to create something more than the sum of its parts and wholly unlike its source material but how was jamie xx able to do all this without compromising the unique voice at the heart of im answer lies in the young producers talent and also in the common thread that runs through both his and scott-herons music: intimacy xx owe their success to a zeitgeisty combination of dubsteps hoods-up introspection with the indulgent navel-gazing of indie for his first new material in 16 years -heron turned his back on broader political concerns and turned inward on himself; the resulting album is run through with uncomfortably confessional lyrics and broken up with revealing spoken-word sections by combining these two unique approaches to soul music jamie xx has created something lyrical an album that jettisons much of the originals vocals and yet still speaks of love life and loss highlights of were conjure a sense of collaboration between two artists who never actually met until after the fact takes a song that -heron left off his album and backs it with gentle vibes and muted clip-hop drums to recreate the sun-drenched haze of trickys maxinquaye incorporates a sample of touch by rui da silva turning a dialogue between the weary narrator of im ( the wilderness of heartbreak the desert of despair ) and the na ve songbird of the ibiza anthem ( im always thinking of you baby ) into something else entirely: shuffling future garage album will probably be best remembered for its most dubstep moments the shimmering opening track and the feverish frequency-testing after all these are the cuts that work best in clubs as jamie xx set out to prove with a grime mix for bbc 1xtra which uses the former as a jumping-off point and a 6 music set bookended by both but as he speeds off in another direction remember to come back to were to enjoy his (and -herons) broadest most poignant collection of music to date
no stranger to the long player mat used the expanded canvas how do do on powershovel to explore more experimental climes on her self-titled album the acclaimed imprint however we see her trying to strike a balance between this and her more dance-oriented work the lp opens with a mood setting piece: it sounds like it came straight from the how do do sessions discordant piano keys flutter against brittle hi-hat and cymbal patterns all undulating in intensity and volume with its druggy ambience and vocal snippets you cant quite make out also seems like it would work on the most open-minded dance floors nonetheless these tracks show dygas getting even better at this type production: the experimental/ambient tracks on compared to her earlier works a similar nature are better instantly comes in with more groove more drums too acoustic percussion is intricately sampled and chopped while major chords set the tone once the kick switches from its half-time plod to a foot-tapping 4/4 rhythm the track springs to life while not as strikingly beautiful as frankly from her prior release is a reminder that she has floor-moving tracks in her on this club friendly tip we find ocbinhs which contains an outlandishly droll vocal i like badger racing the track does indeed groove its way around a heavy drum kit until an arpeggiated synth locks in at around the halfway mark and trans ms it into a rather danceable albeit dark workout delivering such contrasting tracks that work cohesively as an album isnt an easy feat but by drawing from all her styles dygas manages to pull it f with ease here
the slash burn ep is the latest release from record label and disc one features two great productions that should put the rebels well and truly on the map of promising labels kiki silversurfer st tropez is first up and from the moment this devastating baseline enters it is clear that this track is meant for the dark and dirty dancefloors the track ebbs and flows with smooth melodic interludes here and there riding the ever-changing baseline that never remains stagnant a unique production that really works and has a danny howells feel to it ran shanti cordless is the other production in this ep and it s just as unique and interesting as the other the solid beats work the production in the first few moments shortly followed by some rumbling base sounds and smooth melodic effects it s not as pounding as st tropez but the track has a great flow without ever hitting top gear this is an interesting release to say the least and most of all its quite unique which is a very good thing two pretty good productions which is all that you can ask for really

when irish duo debuted on r s earlier this year they were in beastly banger mode nicely invoking the labels legacy of no-holds-barred techno now for their second 12-inch on the belgian imprint theyve gone with it which is to say weirder they redirect the energy inward for two tracks (and one interlude) that burn with the ferocity of a forest fire unfolding with epic splendour over eight minutes is a new high-water mark for in both scale and sound design the duos tunes have always had ear candy but the way they control the ebb and flow of distortion here is remarkable its physical enough to bowl you over but never hard on the ears theres a brighter melody lolling in the background and it only grows louder with the rising waves of fuzz as if it were engaged in some epic battle of the elements thats a hard act to follow but fall one of the duos typical idm-inspired efforts stands up well pummelling but spacious with distorted synth tendrils and a bed of wobbling bass frequencies to precariously prop it all up it recalls the heights of this years eomac solo lp the short hypnagogic is inconsequential in comparison but fall and are massive enough to justify the 12-inch on their own
broken made its release a month ago with a very smooth set of original mixes that had the trademark sound of these two fine producers in tone depth soul tan now its armed with two very solid remixes by label manager g-pal and new boys to the scene stel good newz who have recently impressed on labels such as baroque audiotherapy first up though is the g-pal safe heaven mix expect the usual quality from g-pal a fine and very consistent producer chunky almost tribal beats begin the reworking and soon enough the vocal enters and rides over the rumbling beats and quirky samples melodic hooks soon reign over the track and build it towards the short breakdown deep in that sees the guitar riffs enter as well as subtle building stabbing synths a delicious change in baseline tones deep in is more then welcome and it adds a very nice moody end to this fine production on the flip stel good newz add their touch to proceedings deep chunky baselines are the way early with a cheeky little melody also linking well with the vocal the track drives quite well until it hits a monumentally long breakdown where the vocal plays the lead accompanied well with good atmospheric elements including the main guitar riffs changing baseline tones and smooth broken beats from here on in the track builds to an end with driving beats and guitar riffs that soon fade out two very solid sets of remixes that again lives up to the high quality standards set by this fine greek based label
is one of those producers who can inject soul into the most barebones of house tracks her tunes are straightforward but they hit hard with real feeling a lot of that comes from heavy swing and a delicate melodic touch ruh recently said she gets that swing by only using drum machines because they provide instant groove but thats not giving her enough credit not everyone can get rhythms like hers straight out of the box swing comes to the fore on cave jams vol 1 the first in a new series dedicated to straight-to-tape live recordings even with such a no-frills approach or maybe because of it ruhs talent and personality shine through as ruh said herself cave jams vol 1 s three tracks are percussion-heavy long and mixable each has its own character is hypnotic but keeps you on your toes with a droning vocal sample and a wiry bassline that seems to move independently of everything else nods to ruhs album on underground quality its bassline weaves between layers of snares hats and hand percussion the mammoth b-side is the pick of the bunch its drums are deceptively complex but feel effortless a synth lead smears the track with colour completing a tune thats both simple and memorable
marco m bernd is a bit of a mystery like a lot of dance music producers he conceals all but the most essential information from his ten twitter followers and 225 facebook fans (at the time of writing) he posts about his upcoming releases including this one his fourth since 2010 and thats about it this reticence might work the other way too bernds heads-y dub techno despite its recognisable shape gleams with the conservative exoticness of a pristine undiscovered antique so much so that djs who buy these records would maybe prefer to keep the fact to themselves in the paranoid tradition of secret weapon hoarding as a whole is typical of bernds greyscale bassy palette but the a-side isnt without some colour the eps go-to helter-skelter moment is propelled by bouncy chords that carve themselves into the tracks whiplash-inducing groove its a simple mid-set dub techno record engineered to an exacting standard nothing groundbreaking perhaps but its sleek sound design is irresistible similarly excellent is a gentler jog through the same territory but theres a scrunching sound somewhere between white noise and foot-pressed snow that makes it feel as refreshing as a walk on a winter morning with its subdued kicks and creeping chords is s agoraphobic counterpart churning its dubby sounds within a snug little space its made of the same pliable materials that prop up and but it compels you to tug at your collar as you adjust to its stuffier atmosphere

its huge over-driven kicks are far from inviting but spend a bit of time with vi ns fifth record and a method to the madness emerges produced by truss a london-dweller with proven form on perc trax the 303-driven ep makes particularly good use of texture the acid line in is perhaps the most corrosive ive ever heard wrung of its gloopy liquidity it saws violently at the tracks lower registers rather than simply eating away at them in concert with rusty hi-hats and the thunderous drums it makes the idea of subtlety seem outright pretentious the -side feels comparatively restrained but that isnt saying much theres a hint of hitchcock buried in its screeching horror synths which again pair with roughed-up percussion to enact a massive beatdown rutal unquestionably
when made his debut on it was with striking pop-garage catchy (but not featherweight) and backed up with a slice of warm broken house on the flipside for good measure ut then joseph mcgann returned with way mi defend on lack ox two slabs of surprisingly faithful trad-dubstep that felt like they came from another planet so which is it then mcganns newest for is something like a compromise to be sure these are dubstep tracks but theyre not eyes-down smoke machines like zalea instead theyre loaded up with sometimes gaudy ornamental decor the pounding wraps a vaguely middle eastern sample what sounds like a muslim call to prayer around its jammed gears producing an effect thats both alienating and mystifying as the chanting vocal unfurls into the air more impressive is showcasing a sudden synth sweet tooth from a producer whose previous work was steadfastly monochrome even at its poppiest veins of irridescent synth surge like theyre going to burst around a perfunctory dubstep lurch that wades through the soup of shiny goop y the time it reaches the end and brings out the vocoders the whole thing is a shimmering mass of earwormy melody a whole spectrum of colours you cant even begin to articulate
reissue culture can mean everything from rehashing old knowledge ad nauseam to unearthing vital music from other times and other cultures that was otherwise lost to us take the work that the sofrito djs and label do pulling up tracks from madagascar cape verde haiti and the caribbean that thunder in the present moment after the astonishing set of zouk music compiled by julien achard and nicolas skliris on the sunny digital zandoli set consider this four-tracker from guadeloupean music master erick cosaque to be its heavier counterpart while zouk is song-based (and zandoli focused on songs using early drum machine beats) the gwo ka that cosaque has plied for decades is all about the drums and the chants that are incanted as they thunder along the kaloukera percussions ep draws from 1988-1993 though you wont notice much of a time shift flanm is a stomper as effective a dance floor track as can be rendered with only drums and shouts also features those unceasing drums though theres a sense of effortlessness to them as people play and laugh in the background imitating dog barks and yips female vocals make the hook of manm standout while is nothing but round after round of cosaque and a battery of hand drums working into an entrancing frenzy it would sound perfect both on the island under the sun or in the dark of a techno club
kevin palmers music is at its best when the tension between punk-ish waywardness and cool focus is most keenly felt we know this techno saboteur can be anarchic but his strongest productions are often exercises in tight control as on the techno side of his contribution to styles upon styles bangers ash series its just such a pinpoint focus that makes s highlights so satisfying the title tracks hangdog beat slumps on and on hypnotically allowing little more than a few moments respite from its relentless grind that and the churning wouldnt sound out of place on a recent downwards release; both have a gauntness and stylish restraint that isnt quite palmers usual mo but it suits him well elsewhere s loping drums and splashy texturing are absorbing even if structurally its a little less focussed likewise closer which pivots between eerie stasis and a squall of lo-fi percussion meanwhile is a return to palmers longstanding fixation with the oceanic sonics of dub techno the tracks velvety chords and gently palpitating groove are hardly revolutionary but the way palmer flicks between spaces a lift shafts-worth of delay on the one hand silence on the other breathes new life into these familiar materials
im not one for putting too much stock into what a label head says about artists that hes trying to sell but it was hard not to notice trusmes description of and swoon just a tiny bit hes like a melting pot where carl craig deepchord burial and drexcyia are all put together said the man late last year and strangely if you take trusme at his word s debut ep for the label actually does fit the description you just have to remember of course that trusme never actually said that the melting pot would be as good as all of those artists put together dont get me wrong is good and borders on excellent at times: sounds a tad like the sweet ambient drift of burials dog shelter s first-half is what might happen if deepchord were forced to uncover their housier tunes from that shroud of dub before adds industrial touches in its latter stages meanwhile is a chunky dubstep number that mixes the quick syncopated rhythms of the genre with groaning drones making the track seem much slower than it actually is the sleight-of-hand however doesnt continue on the almost painfully simple which drops everything for a cute idm electro number that is most likely the basis for trusmes drexcyia reference unlike the rest of the tracks here its a distinct and unrepentant throwback a mindless treat at the end of a hard day to be honest its hard to get a read on from this debut ep the producer reportedly has a full-length in the pipeline and if this release is any indication it should be a varied affair but what makes the melting pot artists so great aside from craig perhaps is their single-minded devotion to an idea or sound in that respect itll be interesting to see whether s album is a meal made from scratch or just another mish-mash of leftovers
i had crates and crates of dj records yet i kept coming back to this one lp of people chanting the hare krishna mantra denver mccarthy told a new zealand website recently it was suddenly the only record i wanted to listen to so i gave all the rest of my records away and started selling my musical equipment there was no desire to make music anymore s my ego fell away i lost the taste for it mccarthy was immersed in the uckland rave scene for most of a decade making often high-intensity music under names like mechanism and chaos reader but at the end of the 90s feeling dissatisfied he began to read the hare krishna literature hed bought on the street and was using to prop up his studio monitors the religion would come to define his life: in around 2000 he moved into an ashram in wellington followed by stays in peru bolivia and ecuador before settling in brisbane where he currently works at a krishna restaurant but before his ego fell away completely he made a record that captured a life in transition tackles common techno preoccupations of the time it opens in watery dub techno space and later in plays with dappled basic channel chords elsewhere its succinct grooves and machine soul recall robert hood but 90s berlin and detroit were concrete places mccarthys landscape is internal and immaterial his music sounds of the time but also outside of it and the past two decades havent robbed it of its quiet power mccarthy resurfaced in 2015 with the delsin reissue of his other release as 1999s this album now pressed to vinyl by new zealand label loop features all four tracks from that ep plus seven more that broaden and deepen his internal world the biggest surprises are the downtempo tracks head-nod beatdowns that give the synths room to think with its somersaulting arps is an album highlight the hard-swung drums of are bookended by serene new age chords as if mccarthys dance floor urges were already floating in the deeper current that would soon carry them away theres not much room for doubt in this world of pastel shades and pillowy textures only is darker its ominous pads and oily lugubrious melody hinting at the uncertainty that comes with a major life change elsewhere occasional shadows are soon chased away as on (the title is lifted from hare krishna literature) or on where after two or so minutes of rainy gloom the bassline shifts into a sentimental mode and dazzling dub chords burst into the mix like a revelation
quite possibly the hardest music genres to classify and pin down are the broad nu-jazz broken beat and electro jazz realms of dance music hard in the sense that the three genres are closely linked with chunky beats percussive grooves all accompanied by jazzy instrumentations melodies and chord structures already in its ninth volume (the first being released back in 2000) playground have invited swedens swellsession and ste van b to give everyone a taste of how its done in their part of the world the mix starts off with solid grooves now we got 2 bump - a jazzy sampladelic hip hop piece which cuts up a few recognisable lyrics loungey and laidback it features funky keyboard melodies percussive beats cuts and scratches which make for a nice chill out session moonstarr john kong appear next with yesterdays beginning featuring the spoken word talents of coolhandluke deep basslines and dark moods make this song feel like its been lifted out of a 1920s spy thriller wesley music by rsl takes the mix into gospel territory with a notable latin flavour that can be heard throughout good use of latin percussion featuring some funky breakdowns and jazzy chords while the vocalists deliver an uplifting vocal workout albanek follow on with their soulful walk away featured on this mix in boogie voyage remix form done by none other than swell session a soulful jazzy number swellsession takes it to nu-jazz territory with percussive beats synth hooks and string arrangements lake of perseverance by dom um romau with its tribal beats and african vocal samples provides the mix with some energetic dancefloor vibes filled with conga and bongo drums and this continues on n o h as balkan step which shows off latin and arabian influences with its horn melodies and vocal samples freek by the flaws give the mix a dirty dubby electro flavour featuring the vocals of who seems to be everybodys favourite mc chickaboo rumbly bass drops and funky synth hooks are the order of the day on this one before the mix goes back into funky nu-jazz rhythms on bobby hughes combinations kerma elastica featured here in a remix done by nicola conte usually associated with drumnbass are the artists on the closing tracks the first being cleveland watkiss on torch of freedom on a latin influenced soul jazz number and the mix closes off with london elektricitys slow-plodding jazz influenced number born to synthesize - london elektricity shed off their usual 175 bpm skin in favour for a more laidback number playground vol 9 is an eclectic mix and i suppose thats a pretty common theme in nu-jazz and broken beat mixes - never ones to be pigeonholed into just one particular flavour of music its lush its colourful and has a very international feel about it for those who like their beats full of texture jazzy vocals with the occasional ethnic flavours thrown in playground vol 9 is highly recommended
is a multi cultural affair that in no way betrays any of its roots not those of the spanish label on which it is released ( ) nor those of the rgentinian ( ndr s ) or german ( ) producers behind it its just modern shiny house done well is an nton zap like fusion of solid chunky drum loops that never quite resolve and plenty of squirming forward looking and cosmic sounding synths its basement house keen on peering over the parapet without ever fully revealing itself where side daves is much more content to soar or sulk depending on where the synths take it they meander freely building to suggested zeniths without ever fully peaking instead folding back in on themselves and beginning the undulating process once again dramatic but deep its a natural set closer that sounds like chicago in theory but is more contemporary and metallic in practice

with releases from galtier zi r and ings is at the forefront of club musics turn towards the aggressive n shu the debut from la producer evangelia lachianina (aka ) is something else entirely inspired by recent events in her native greece and her experience as an immigrant living in the us the record feels unstable and explosive n shu is presented as a riot piece meant to channel what lachianina says is a greek tradition of rioting its title is taken from a secret language spoken by women in the chinese province of hunan who were denied literacy education in kind the mini-album has a unique form of expression from the eerie wordless voices in to the funereal synths and blazing jungle breaks of there are voices and messages here but the meaning isnt always clear the record offers three-minute blast after three-minute blast of increasingly distorted textures tunes are packed with encoded signifiers like the palpitating drum bass hints of the rolling reese basslines that pile up on or the harsh funk of its hybrid electronic music that taps into the same rushing currents of non or naafi albeit aimed outside the dance floor
post rock fans may be disappointed to learn that s latest isnt a tribute to the distortion-addicted bristol shoegazers of the 90s; given their shared affinity for lo-fi aesthetics a remix of the latter by the former could have been a match made in heaven does feature the recurring sound of a guitar amplifier being kicked its reverb coil zinging like a gunshot but otherwise the ep is all about stefan laubners well-established style of muddle-headed slightly counterintuitive funk finds him in uncharacteristically full-on mode with a gnarled bassline squelching its way around hard clattery drum machine patterns the mid-tempo has a sour-tuned arpeggio twitching nervously against a backdrop of dissonant synths; the drum groove is a stroke of genius with syncopated kicks flopping to and fro like a fish out of water with laubner drops the tempo yet again sinking into a satisfying boom-bap cadence while rhodes chords sketch a sad meandering melody and quavering choral pads sing an ambivalent tribute to our new extraterrestrial overlords
its got all the makings of a messy night round at the pad - the sort of night where you stumble around the room lunging from disc to disc without a thought for your neighbours changing musical direction violently with each tune so it is here drawing the biggest possible distinction between styles and it works a treat so we have the prodigys out of space implausibly leading in to the stranglers golden brown which in turn gives way to roots manuvas strange behaviour indeed there are some classic pop songs here and as you might expect the specials a clear influence on are represented with blank expression along with diehards from the kinks and squeeze the obligatory exclusive towards the end of the mix is a new bullys track burnt out seguing into the sublime god only knows - the beach boys of course more examining of stylistic roots comes with madness and my girl but the tune following the camden massive did it for me - wildchilds renegade master never bettered in its original version a refreshingly unique approach to a compilation and a good compliment to the debut album ego war from earlier this year this particular is a riotous hour of fun and frolics just before the tv goes out the window
developed through songwriting sessions in portland rings debut a collaboration between liz harris grouper and jesy forentino tiny vipers seeps grainy rain-drowsiness pacific northwestern homes each (portland for harris seattle for forentino) you can almost hear eaves dripping beyond albums dim cup o tea atmospheres which run from more classical folk songwriting associated with forentino and narcotic dronescapes harriss work as grouper both got ir start within orbit experimental noise and metal scene though its ir shared talent for merging contemplative repetition with almost intangible half-spun melodies that brings m toge r as ring opener crests a frothy spill drone harriss voice is withdrawn against noise a near-whisper that sounds like someone in deaths grip singing ir fondest memories fireside framed against quiet guitar parts providing sly counter-textures to its wind-blasts; its a track that wouldnt have sounded out place on ei r groupers second or third albums the gorgeous the treads similarly elegiac terrain but harriss voice is pushed almost to fore tracks sea-lost murk sounding almost adrift on its dead drifting sense time our likewise is a junkies lullaby all starry-eyed chords and lethargic vocal trails but its really on nine-minute album centerpiece where duo hit ir stride opening with a guitar part that sounds like a one-third speed roy harper intro harriss voice slowly wafts into place as breaths drone and organ paint corners before slipping out beneath forentinos picked guitar and simmers noise but forentino-led tracks though by no means emphatic rely on more traditional songcraft in a way that sometimes undermines night-dream sprawl grouper-like material theyre a kind unwanted near-sobriety after a bender lost to memory as when finger-picked guitars and full-front vocals sift out dizzy spell likewise though it hews closer to foggy-figures established elsewhere sounds almost as though its pressing for acknowledgment and response by comparison harris is a quiet if insistent hum against din; forentinos every syllable and word is heard in clearing it shakes listener out albums warm drowse its admittedly a small complaint to make for an album with quiet grace but its perhaps also telling that best moments here are almost indistinguishable from groupers best work
come from philadelphia but its hard to talk about their music without a plethora of spacey adjectives their ability to leap between intense claustrophobia and zero-gravity depths makes for a deeply alienated listening experience best exemplified on last years infratracts lp on morphine while their latest effort for morphosis label doesnt necessarily expand their sonic palette own a distinct niche that remains as captivating as it is confrontational according to the sleeve was recorded in december 2012; its sand-paper-dry drum production certainly sets it apiece with their topographical interference ep of the same year a dissonantly pitched synth sets an expansive sheet atop the developing drum patterns which themselves are eventually lifted off into a void of echo sounds something like a collapsing nebula endless reverb tails strafe around a modular sequence before the gain is cranked up to levels that make you question how much sound a piece of music can hold its the sort of track that will either set you running or stop you in your tracks
the four tracks which make up the seventh release from sound as if they were chiselled in some deep underground mine: each one rumbles grumbles and tumbles up to the surface through a long and dusty mine shaft with an earth shaking resonance thats hard to ignore manchesters tom opens proceedings with a burrowing rolling bassline searching apocalyptic synths and a distant double clap combo its earthy and muddy as it prowls forwards whereas kowtons contribution is a little more suspenseful you make you make repeats a woman sporadically as pinging bass notes dart around it for his next contribution the bristol man tackles s original stripping it back to a subterranean growl accompanied by misty hi-hats and weird vocal murmurings its dark and moody like everything here with a predatory dub undercurrent moving the whole thing slowly forward finally tackles kowtons with a little more bounce in his step and crafts something which is on the verge of cantering but which never fully breaks its step synth stabs add urgency where before it was mysteriousness that ruled nonetheless this one will operate best in some dusty darkened bunker well away from the flashing lights and benevolent melodies of the main room

the breakbeat twins of hope have now completed their debut album and it makes for an exciting and original addition to a genre that has already performed well this year thanks to the likes of the plump djs hybrid and free*land contains a lot more vocal material than i expected and while not always consistent the lyrics are pretty much above standard the opening call to arms flick the switch is a great way to get going and vanish provides the most catchy hook over a monster bass youll find the woofers also get disturbed on motherless a cutting low range sound the capeoiras betray a few 80s influences on do it your way as the album begins to wind down into the relatively chilled out closing two tracks propane in particular is a surprise with a gorgeously tender closing section most unusual of all the things here though is four (4x3) a fusion of a kind of 90s warehouse style breakbeat a fretless bass and a vocal scat in the bebpo style if i say it sounds like the audio bullys and st germain bumping into each other on a dark night dont be put off its the most original thing on an entertaining debut album
are quickly proving themselves to be the most diverse of the leeds based electronic music scene here they drop a fine slab of quirky funked about-with driving house in north of north west the clunky funk drops into an urgent vocal and a cleverly composed drum pattern that s totally of the moment a breakdown contrasts the dirtiness of the drums into a happy come over here and give me a nice hug vibe before falling back into proper-rocking drums and vocal fx vaborub is more emotive and groovy with a stabby detroity bass line and long synth lines marshal jefferson s gotta have house music sample is cleverly filtered to sound completely fresh and works really well with the rest of the track

sees dynamo dreesens leave the 12-inch format for a dalliance with the double-pack who better to take the reins than porn sword tobacco the swedish producer whos no stranger to cido has developed an affinity for the format both 2015s magnifik botanik for niara recordings and last years recordings 1 - 4 with svn were double packs that featured some of henrik jonssons best work as porn sword tobacco this ep finds him at his most transcendental from the surfer on the cover to the birdsong and gently lapping waves in the music the relationship between humanity and nature seems key theres so much detail to pore over that you can understand why the label decided to press one track per side two enveloping ambient tracks bookend the double pack including the particularly rewarding ten-minute d-side heat-soaked saunter through heavily textured loops that phase in and out of focus it remains captivating until its closing seconds the other two tracks are more unpredictable the b-side is vintage cido as the chatter of birds mingles with smudged pads and far-off percussion more focused groove appears after a few minutes familiar dappled drums pitched just right to complement the submerged sonics the c-side plunges deeper into the abstract its a romantic type of ambient rife with passing narratives as though jonsson is idly browsing the fm dial to soundtrack a day at the beach
is a producer and dj with a talent that separates her from virtually all of her peers: she can sing when she takes the microphone during a set at a place like panorama bar (where she is a resident) and adlibs vocals over a track you can sense a dramatic change in the atmosphere something thats unique to her her second ep for is she says a continuation of an effort to establish a persona as a producer distinct from that of the singer who also djs moves at a more considered pace than her ostgut debut loch hill and this unhurried approach suits is typical of the lush synth arrangements she plays in her sets the melodies are generous and tightly weaved together swelling and twisting as they go before theyre wrung dry by a breakdown that exposes the tracks nimble bassline s sharp chords press firmly on the bassline which is tightly-wound and fleet-footed its the simplest track of the three but its emphasis on bass and melody which combine to give the track an end-of-the-night feel lends it plenty of power the title track is the only one with vocals but here they dont add much to the songs appeal the tracks chicago sci-fi feel falls a bit flat lacking the vitality of the eps other songs

s incredible lights out compilation was so good amongst other reasons because it managed to balance exploration and journeying with a feeling that the listener was always within a tightly bounded arena it knew its scope clearly but went where it wanted within it a place where tech rollers sat neatly alongside the likes of crossovers off-key nu-glam phostographt lawler and this motley crew of not-to-be-sniffed-at remixers may not go as far as that on but theres plenty of versatility within the vicinity of the kind of tough mediterranean-friendly tribal/tech area that he generally occupies lawler delivers as expected on : congas and south american percussion clank around roughly underneath a souly voice professing the spiritual benefits of dancing and beats until the kick barges in to propel it forward that all sounds fairly cliched and it is but its damn solid nonetheless and theres little doubt that it would go down a storm on a sunday night at space guti has even more congas; they rule the track giving it both a screwloose slightly surreal carnival feeling and because theyre short on variation an over-insistency mendo on the other hand betters the original with four beats of ultra tight glass-bottle percussion and rising bass looping over and over in support of the vocal which is wiped in tone-destroying effect this time its simple driving and again insistent but in an entirely funky way a more experimental turn is taken by and id jazz man as he is but hes put down the trumpet and bongos in favour of dark doomy synth punctuations and a jacking acoustic snare that stutters every so often; cool and interesting with more than a touch of roughness chopping up the bit from the original audiofly marries this the rest of the track and a sliding sub-bass with dubby chords making it spacious and sleazy at the same time david s version is much warmer and more chordy; an overtly joyful peaky take they all offer something unique alongside the rest and if youre into lawlers mixing at all youre likely to find a fine battle weapon somewhere in here

following on from their crowd pleasing soul vibrates/bullet train from which bullet train saw itself included in soul of mans y4k mix and the soon to be released chew the fat compilation on fat records the return for with two dancefloor destroying monsters side a get kinky keeping to the tradition of production this tune makes use of a hard hitting break featuring loud smashing snares and razor sharp hi hats - with an awesome use of drum fills and clever buildups throughout as well taking care of the lower frequencies is a freaked out acid bass line combined with signature plump squeaks (and bleeps ) synth stabs and can we get kinky toniiiight vocal stabs if the plumps were to do their take on the sounds of the crystal method during their vegas era this would probably be it - stadium rocking west coast breakbeat with tinges of electro throughout side aa pressure pressure is a noisier effort designed to fill the room and cements this fact by opening up with a eardrum piercing tone during the first beatdrop this is a dirtier affair featuring a menacing and rumbling bassline a chopped up vocal lick plenty of techy stabs and hoovers and that piercing tone from the beginning the main beatdrop which occurs halfway through the tune sounds like an 80s computer game on speed as it speeds through a computer generated sample lifted off an old defender cartridge i found this less appealing to get kinky as it is really noisy
sounds like someone is brushing their teeth in the first track of s brushing their teeth really really hard just on occasion mind rest of sees the producer also known as stl pinning a (lightly) industrialized breakbeat and bells upon bells into a mess of sound beamed directly out of care because you do -era aphex twin s one of my favorite tracks of the year not because its nostalgic but instead because it showcases yet another side to one of the worlds most talented and prolific producers stephan laubner as hes also sometimes known has two well-known modes: hypnotic house champion and unsung drone merchant latter is what the rest of focuses upon laubner pitting slow-moving field recordings against one another mountains of sound you know generally what it sounds like specifically laubner is interested in sound with a depth that is often unmatched by contemporary ambient producers he lets in the same sort of grit around the edges as he does on his house tracks as stl more than happy to use the grain of the recording to his advantage marks him out among those who have taken a digital approach to drones re are mistakes things dont line up neatly melodies dont appear ready to sweep you off your feet into aching reverie you also wont find laubner calling his tracks when you realized was a lie his purpose isnt to elicit easy emotional responses more often its something like of or underlining a complexity of both construction and aim orchestra which is largely composed of material that has already been released through his cd series acts as a neat summation of these investigations s the first time that most (any ) of it has been pressed to vinyl the first time that laubner has taken the financial risk of putting out ambient on wax for those looking to experience the second (and third) side of what laubner does its the perfect way to jump in
s bio tells us that hes a treasured icon of the electronic north of france which seems to these eyes a little bit like saying that hes the finest ice fisherman in all of the sahara but based on his latest release for geography has little to do with s appeal his brand of techno works anywhere an underground cousin to dubfires blasts of white noise for instance is able to do its job with irritating shrieks over a quickly pulsating synth like most techno of its kind its fascinatingly simple and brutally effective is the same way a slower grind but equally as lacking in clutter relies here on the languid beeps sending out signals into the distance allowing them time to breathe and expand while lithe feedback slices through the back half of the track that downcast vibe is continued by function in his remix of a take which sees the berlin resident creating an altogether different view of s metropolis there is an equal amount of open space as in s original but function fills the emptiness with a subtle underlying atmosphere that adds a layer of depth its the best thing here but not by much indeed if things continue like this perhaps someday will be a treasured icon of the entire country
for most of its decade-long run acidos output has been notably slow something that might be explained by its proprietors borderline superstitious a r methods cannot just pick any artist dynamo dreesen told us in t has to be someone would meet naturally who cross paths with like his music like his style like his personality n it becomes an acido record whether hes loosened this criteria is hard to say but acido has picked up the pace as of late releasing four eps per year instead of the usual one or two result has been an armful of good-but-not-great records from the once untouchable label which makes their latest ep a welcome return to form comes from karl lukas petterson a swedish electro artist also known as luke eargoggle ts two tracks and are essentially variations on the same idea both trundle along with leaden kicks and muddy synths brilliantly offset by crystal clear twinkles of melody that occasionally cut through the mix on both a childlike voice eerily repeats the titular phrase chords are catchy the sound design exquisitely imperfect but as with acidos best records its the overall personality at once campy and avant-garde that makes these tracks so good

red devil first appeared back in april as an online mix comprised of eight new tracks sewn together and mastered by these mini-mixes or mixfiles as theyre more commonly called are popular in experimental club music inviting artists to take a more collage-like approach to their work - a cape town-based producer and one of the three founders of excels at mixfiles his music is often fragmented and confrontational like the stunning death drop from heaven which helped kick off in 0 5 red devil which is now getting a full vinyl release via (and split into two parts as a result) is some of -hos most fully realized work so far red devil has all the cornerstones weve come to associate with this type of dance music: clashing melodies samples of broken glass disruptive drum patterns all of it somewhat haphazard but within the first few minutes its clear that red devil is not business as usual this is the work of someone who feels at home in this maelstrom of sound theres a seesaw between anarchy and order on red devil that makes it more than just destructive catharsis and all the fury existential dread and fleeting moments of joy come together in a more intelligible way red devil isnt necessarily less abrasive or startling than past - releases but it moves with a newfound finesse the first few tracks resemble a coordinated chaos as if - were conducting an orchestra of urban noise drifting in and out of eerily silent movements before crashing back into full-blast (the first real drop on the album halfway through feels like a kick in the stomach ) a choir emerges here and there adding a regal atmosphere while defeated-sounding chords that recall prurient and coil colour darker shades elsewhere some tracks are simply great bangers for example has a massive rhythm that fuses grime and jersey club but as a dj with a copy of red devil youd have to be careful of which part you play because crashes into a -assisted track with a squealing anguished synth guitar that the tracks arent separated is key to red devil the lps constant motion where the impact of each track is tempered or amplified by what comes before and after is what makes it work so well like many experimental club releases red devil has a concept its meant to illustrate the experience of being queer and trans an existence that carries risk every time one enters a public space while themes of identity politics can sometimes seem like window-dressing when applied to a non-verbal confrontational style of music conflicting emotions radiate from red devil in a way thats hard to ignore (even if you dont read the explanatory notes that accompany it) it ends with a furious passage titled which leaves us no closer to resolution
dismissing previous critiques of his work as being too experimental romanian dj/producer has continued to cast light on strange realms existing somewhere between minimal tribal and tech house guides us through a 13-minute percussion session that could be a reexamination of the relationship between tribal or world music beats and modern techno; to others it will certainly just be minimal house that samples hand drums with live percussive samples that seem to wear themselves out in an attempt to break free from the framework of dance floor rhythm its both fascinatingly cerebral and satisfyingly groovy flies under the radar with a deceptively straightforward metallic beat only to alarm the listener with gnarly pitched-down vocal clips and rising pad afterthoughts reminiscent of cathedral reverberations once more playing off a juxtaposing theme then introduces atonal unpleasant synthesizer grunts the romanian word rhiva translates to rchive in english in an electronic music scene that appears to be pre-occupied with other musical trends at the moment this may be a fitting title for this nonetheless accomplished 12-inch

as nottingham-born london-based artist laurence blake puts it his first lp as is concerned with the idea of humanity infusing with technology and how the western worlds obsession with augmenting our natural abilities allows us to manifest complex ideas and emotions in an artistic context thats fairly profound stuff coming from a dance music producer and dj is hardly a concept album however in fact if blake hadn t mentioned them directly itd be practically impossible to discern any themes its hard to see blake as a futurist hes said himself that the music policy of his glastique nights in london was basically nothing post 95 and releases like his trax ep sound like they come from that era and yet finds ways to blend his past interests with new ones blake uses tested tricks like scything strings crisp drums and simple loops on tracks like and his trademarked vocal slices displayed on last years where is love now are deployed like doomy organ chords on bongdage and transformed into animalistic hoots on but when singer joins blake on and she mostly coos a few words low in the mix one exception is s appearance on the frostbitten along with both tracks hint at a fresh bass music influence blake also spreads his wings for the impressive which soars on the sort of starbound synths carl craig would love for an artist with a notable past as a video director blake rarely sounds cinematic its difficult to see as much more than a soundtrack for the dance floor which certainly isnt a bad thing: at the end of the day this is deep house of superior quality the sound that initially likened blake to kerri chandler and ralph lawson whether in the future or the past that sound will always have its place
is a bit of a shapeshifter but if theres one constant in his work its his fondness for well-rounded sounds that hasnt changed on his debut where he works dusty samples into something equally as glossy as his best material the horn sample on sounds old but its varnished smooth so that it sounds modern think the sample-heavy house of londons dead rose music company rinsing out a single vocal sample for minutes on end the songs cresting chords show off daneekas dexterity with decay and repetition the transition into its full three-word phrase after a finger-snapping breakdown just feels natural (part ii) tries to be a little more austere it has all the sandy textures and smooth basslines of its classicist house counterpart and a swooning breakdown but its cavernous chord stabs are slate-grey techno all the way its a competent hybrid of styles that still lacks the personality of sounding more like an off-cut from his work with enjamin damage than anything new or exciting
theres a thick haze across ep but dont let that fool you these tracks are jacking like a lot of minimal the drums and basslines do most of the work providing an upbeat platform for a collage of cosmic effects the feeling on the three original tracks is introspective you might sway to them while assessing your life choices at whatever afterhours you happen to be at that weekend a cheery track with squiggling bleeps and an extended breakdown is the highlight among the originals and are more subdued piling on pads and floaty synths over shuffling drums that never stick to the same pattern for long all three are high-end tunes reserved for patient crowds and decent soundsystems dana s swinging remix of ups the energy with a rapid-fire beat and a big bassline rounding off a solid ep from a producer who understands what makes intimate dance floors tick

is the third and final release from pitch controls compilation and judging by the quality of the tracks here it appears and just decided to phone this one in these two cuts are supposed to be the club hits off the comp but they nowhere near live up to the designation has had a string of quality releases as of late ranging from the sleek single uf ix to a remix of heartthrobs aby kate that may have surpassed (and out gothed) the original ain t one of them with this we find abandoning his trademark trancey hugeness for a quieter less urgent sound the track suffers from this decision seeming only to whisper aimlessly for an overlong six minutes s personality does emerge around the 1:30 mark but its far too brief and not enough to save the sinking ship on the bright side he may have invented a new sub genre: elevator techno on the flip side drops a nice piece of minimal funk with his debut with pitch control he moves his effort forward with an immediacy that the lacks the deftly layered percussion varies enough to grab the listeners attention and continues to build with some nice technical flourishes but then nothing t just fades into the sunset overall neither track is really fit for the extended treatment given here sounding more like cutting floor pieces than anything else truly disappointing release and a surprising misstep from the rapidly rising pitch control family

has been off the radar for a while as far as original solo productions go hes never far from our memories of course when it comes to remixes or collaborations for that matter (jamming with lindstr m helping lackbelt andersen put together his album) so it comes as no small thing when the man emerges with new(ish) work for his imprint i say ish because at least one track here bears the name of another man: fitzpatrick takes elements or only elements i cant tell which of one of the many jigsaw puzzle pieces of ricardo villalobos fabric mix thomas predictably smooths out the drum track paring down the minimal to its bare essentials (and theyre not all that bare even then what with the constant drum fills) the focus as it is with all of thomas work is on the work that loops do over time rather than in the short-term like villalobos thomas works with minimalism to weave spells in his productions making you forget where you are why youre there and even who you are (until somehow a tribal vocal loop has taken over completely and things just stop altogether ) and operate in that same vein moving slowly but surely along their lines until thomas has run each through its paces interestingly theyre nothing like his mixes which seem to be all-over-the-place affairs that often value populism over subtle groove-based journeys into space that thomas has carved out places at both ends of the spectrum though simply proves what a rare talent he is
this next release on eq grey sees the likes of ortus and dj garth markie mark take to remix duties of time unlimited a production of un:plug first up is the ortus remix the track that started phil k s balance mix it begins in a very ambient mood with smooth string patterns rolling alongside some very minimal percussion and soon enough some lush beats kick into the track with a subtle vocal great mood and atmosphere as you would expect from ortus a producer who has had some great tracks behind him in the past on the flip is the dj garth markie mark remix on the whole this remix is quite a quirky production with interesting drum patterns as well as vocal snippets that make the arrangement quite interesting smooth baselines bounce throughout the track giving it a good groove and on the whole it maintains a good flow a pretty good release here with two tracks that are both quite impressive not one side really stands out here and both are quite diverse enough to impress
maurice ravel was it seems a man often critical of his own compositions he saw himself occupying a no mans land between the old style of melody and no-holds barred experimentation practiced by schoenberg and others he once said that there is an implied melodic outline in all vital music but at the same time made room for the idea that repetition had the power to influence mood just as powerfully the resonances with modern techno are pretty obvious and clearly something about ravels bol ro has caught the ears of the leading lights of dance music carl craig and moritz von oswalds recomposition of that 1 -minute ballet as well as music from fellow composer modest mussorgsky into a sixty minute electronic odyssey was made with an obvious love for the original nd the worlds oldest record label has now gone one step beyond craig and oswalds original recomposition offering dance floor ready remixes by craig himself and by ricardo both producers are on screaming form craigs (c2 uses rotund horn-like sounds before plunging into a techno monster that makes good on every bit of bass in the original recomposition craigs track is a terrifying room-swallowing techno monster that could hold its own against udions most daring moments but which nevertheless manages to preserve a touch of the delicacy of bol ro take is lighter and retains more obvious classical sounds his ponyhof mix sent me to google: pparently a ponyhof is a sort of horse-riding/family vacation camp popular in germany and the netherlands i can confirm that the galloping rhythms in version make for an equally good holiday in a recent interview with xlr r echoed ravel by saying that melody in the club context [is] more or less like a feeling injection something coming from time to time but the most important thing is the rhythm trip ponyhof is both one hell of a rhythm trip and a luscious feeling injection if in 0 years or so the producers of the future are looking for something to recompose into their negative-hz music made on alien-brain instruments i suggest they look no further than this piece of vinyl

i do not exclaim tweeted a few months back in response to music journos ascribing extra enthusiasm to the producer in interview transcripts nd paul roses music techy sullen inward-looking has traditionally fit this character profile: neither his dark debut album mutual ntipathy nor its cagey follow-up triangulation sounded like the work of someone who speaks in exclamatory phrases but s latest for his own hotflush label does in fact the three positively beaming slices of trancey (trancey ) techno on offer might add up to the most ebullient record of the year even given loss his upbeat anthem (as scb) on us music thats been slaying clubs all year and the ticklish feel it from hotflushs back and 4th comes as something of a shock but does this about-face deliver in terms of being extremely effective and impeccably produced absolutely the title cut is basically loss turned up to 11: a carefully snipped vocal sample once again runs the show though the tracks breakdown comes earlier and amps things up well beyond where loss dared to go careful listen to s chords though reveals just a pinch of his signature glumness still the tracks pure uplift basically masks the morose pairs s newfound lush synths with an electro beat that is dare i say kind of sexy this formula lightens up even more on a slice of 80s-indebted dance pop (dance pop ) that wouldnt sound unwelcome at an aerobics class itd be difficult to digest s massive stylistic shift if these werent some of his best-produced tracks
following on from his debut release on re:connect neil briggs aka returns with a heavy platter of two original tunes so far hes pulled off remixes for labels like full intent skydive recordings and bless records and also hosts his own show on breaks fm side a open your eyes must have learnt a thing or two from future funk squad as the drum programming has distinct elements of ffs style - stabby kick drums thin hi-hats combined with crashing snares after a short breakdown a big electro hook kicks in with a dirty rolling bassline taking care of the bottom end another drop takes place in the middle featuring female sci-fi vocal stabs before the tune goes half tempo (about 70 bpms) for a wicked hip hop style breakdown before the tempo doubles back to the original theme side b thru time on the flip thru time features a funkier breakbeat with a melodic bassline before it crosses over into trancey territories featuring a massive synth hook and a lovely piano melody an epic female vocal is introduced during the middle beatdrop who sings in acappella before the beats and melodies build up and accompany her to the end its a really musical effort with catchy hooks and vocals on a serious note - perhaps more suited to sister label en:vision
sometimes club music needs little more than a drum machine and the occasional strange noise and s ep is a recent case in point each track places dry drums amidst zaps and gurgles but theyre by no means straightforward rather than writing genre-centric tools cultivates the time-honoured combination of rhythmic economy and demented atmospheres ending up with a 12-inch that sounds like no one else the title track is surprising: oodles of sub-bass which would go largely undetected in less-than-optimal listening contexts make for a darker more techno-oriented heft the arrangement and structure sound relaxed and performed rather than hyper-calculated but you know has the timing just right when the highlight is a simple introduction of a clap the b-side is more syncopated and hard-edged is slinky as hell and features a background sound like the muffled laugh of a deranged infant the mixture of menace and merriment continues on like the preceding tracks its leisurely paced and offers little in the way of structural or sonic pyrotechnics the assumption being that if youre playing nuanced heady music like this youve already got the dance floor in the palm of your hand in that sense is only as good as your programming and pacing its not going to do the heavy lifting for you but if you set it up just so itll be a highlight of the night
heres one of dance musics dirty little secrets: most of the tracks that stretch toward ten minutes and beyond dont really need to be that long its one thing to indulge an idea a feeling or a sound another to make that things manifest themselves in new interesting ways over a lengthy span even if you hide behind the veil of its intended for long mixes that isnt an issue with the title track of cambridge producer s new ep on his own dont be afraid label lasts nearly 11 minutes but its one of those rare house tracks that seems to be evolving in front of your ears even as it follows a familiar enough structure the big swaddling synth chords help to even out the skittering pulse they vault over just as the twitching bassline keeps things jumping beneath thats plenty of push-pull as is but a sometime event reviewer for ra keeps finding new corners to explore its not perfect but its engrossing which isnt something you can say of too many tracks right now never mind ones that seem as improvisatory as this one often does reverses the tenses some: here the beat is straighter with some percussive syncopation and a little synth judder to goose it its more a line than an image though roth does well to enlist detroits dj for a remix his bright-toned synth lines dart rather than scatter setting up a jaunty organ that harks back to stax or trojan and commingles easily with the digital gleam surrounding it
even though youre as likely to hear 90s techno as ricardo villalobos tracks at club der visionaere these days that hasnt stopped labels associated with the venue from honing the sound pioneered by minimals leading artist recordings the label run by the club der visionaere regular cleymoore is back with its first ep of a two-track brain massage from with plenty of low-end power driven by a mean bassline and ultra-precise percussion the gritty isnt as romantic as its title ( so much love ) the kind of tune best heard on a sweaty club der visionaere dance floor long after your last friend called it a night its a 14-minute head trip thats a perfect option for djs barely standing ten hours into a set the track never stays the same for long with a few crafty breakdowns that refocus the energy on the dreamy spoken-word vocal the cheerier is made with more familiar sounds n occasional guitar lick nods to minimals latin associations while squelchy percussion recalls other club der visionaere-associated producers such as dewalta less original than its -side counterpart its a safer bet for busy dance floors minimal might be evolving but releases like mo remind us that theres plenty of room for traditionalists like
it s been a huge year for having begun life last year as a subsidiary of sonar kollektiv this young but frighteningly consistent berlin based imprint headed up by dixon and french production titans me now operates independently and with the release of this unmixed compilation cd justly celebrates its already superlative impact and influence on contemporary house and techno is of course about all things deep has already become synonymous with the return (though some might argue it never really left) of the deep house sound but the contents of is not deep house as we previously knew it although it carries the warmth and thoughtful aesthetic of its historical forebears the sound is armed with production weaponry and technique borrowed from recent electro house and minimal techno which gives it a richness and intensity all its own and makes it irresistibly modern me have been the chief architects of this shift in / vogue leading the way with their majestic all slaying that track appears on this cd and while it s been played to death over the last twelve months one still can t help at marvel at its originality finesse and sheer drama s recent smash with its descending organ keys heavy drum track and fizzing synths will probably not have escaped your attention when it emerged as a back in autumn but is worth the price of admission alone here if it did the most recent single from me s countrymen chateau kicks off the compilation and is perhaps the most anomalous track on here a kinetic nu disco cut that lacks the spaciousness but not the groove of the productions which follow but it s the less anthemic tracks that really satisfy tracks that you may have missed when they first appeared s sublime sets a breezy latin inflected swing to a fat bassline thumping rhythm track and processed balearic guitar lines; and s brooding criminally underrated is killer dancefloor material s three( ) cavernous pitched down contributions tend almost towards trip hop but that seems a reductive appraisal for tunes as haunting as or as menacing as s appears in its original form and not the superior stripped down remix by me which occupied the flip of the but it is nonetheless a welcome offering coming over like a perfect evolutionary step between the sonar kollektiv sounds of old (jazzanova and the like) and the dynamic new breed which are showcased elsewhere on it s the last track that gives the compilation its title and it truly situates in the extra temporal continuum of deep (house) music provides a solid musical and lyrical manifesto for : produced by me dixon and ever versatile genius schwarz (whose productions never fail to impress with their sheer exuberant musicality) it s spoken acapella from chicago/classic legend calls to mind gil scott heron s state of the nation addresses programme yourself to feel instructs a fitting sentiment to strap to dancefloor machine music so fiercely soulful emotional and human as this if you ve been picking up each then there s no reason for you to buy this compilation if however you ve missed some or (god forbid) all of their releases you now have no excuse hand over your cash and immerse yourself in the output of a label that right now has a fair claim to being quite simply the best around
following on from the ill-received tracky tech offerings of mr g seemed to be slipping perhaps in response boss man djulz has pulled a masterstroke by enlisting deep house and techno types and dj for his next release necessarily alter goes a little more direct to the dance floor than on his magnificent mod album (alongside jonsson on kontra-musik) but between the organised beats his loose and organic style still prevails also intertwined into of are the soulful spoken word musings of eric d clark: his mutterings roll alongside a tranquilized horn line and a supple groove which grows ever more prominent until the understated breakdown when everything comes back in and the groove engages once more its deep but well aerated closer 2 me is immediately more up with prominent hand claps dragging rolling beats and gentle chord prods despite the increased tempo its still a snug slice of deep house shrouded in a warming edge-softening mistiness dj s first remix of shimmers from start to finish moving in toward you then pulling away just as quickly really its all about repetition and the micro-evolution of his loops with an oppressive tension never letting up throughout s second effort raises its head out of the murky depths somewhat with dubby basslines and circling synths flowing round each other sans even the slightest sense of friction for six hypnotic minutes

with rumours abounding that hessle udio co-founder david kennedy will be phasing out his ramadanman guise its no great stretch of the imagination to ponder another guise taking its place hes already got pearson sound ut we must also welcome to the fold with a few press dis-information pieces out there suggesting its actually a chicago legend behind this single on untolds records imprint and some very authentic artwork/packaging the scene is set for an intriguing release that has a bit of hype to live up to containing all of the elements of a classic house production; from the repetitive vocal loop to the bouncy 4-4 kick and of course a hearty open hi-hat kennedy then works in that signature sound on which make it pure pearson n 808 click overlaps the more traditional house drum sounds before a nice synth pad breaks the tune down before once more belting it back in to proper house music territory crescendo-ing in some snapping snare rolls that indicate a huge influence on kennedys output in his other guises is certainly a lot meatier in terms of drum programming tempo and melody straight out of the early 90s or even the late 80s it doesnt really get any more authentic than this on first listen this one sounded like more recognisable as a pearson sound production when in truth aside from the standout mastering job any house music aficionado might have a hard time identifying this as a contemporary production

is finally here and the first release on the label is by the head honcho himself (james) the track is and it sets the benchmark very high for all following releases the vinyl is jammed pack with a main mix an ambient mix and a couple of dj tools for the jocks to get maximum value out of this production on the a-side is the main mix the familiar drum patterns of s work begin the production as snares rattle and the baseline digs deep the track builds and builds in the early stages as a melody tries to break out of the confines the beats stop momentarily a break that acts as a introduction for the melody to take effect it s a trademark addictive melody that combines well with the beats deep into the track the beats take a break and the melody intertwines with a big roaring baseline that changes notes to devastating effect james has hit the mark yet again with this production on the end of the a-side is the fluffapella that includes the melodic arrangements on its own as a dj tool firstly on the b-side is the beats tool it s a track that showcases the complexity of the drum patterns and in itself is quite a solid production it uses a stuttered kick pattern and drums random percussive effects and minimal melodic interludes also on the b-side is the excellent ambient version slow beats unite with the main melody in a journey that also involves random effects and a unique soundscape particularly late in the track this is sure to appeal to many and it demonstrates the diverse talents of james productions a quality debut for the label that is sure to be the kick start to something very successful with at the helm there is sure to be something unique and very special in each release just as there is with the first release here is definitely heading towards the clouds
it seems a while now since talk of dubstep getting into bed with techno had any sort of wow-factor since the glory days of 2008 the core scene (if you could ever call it that) has splayed off in all manner of tangential directions leaving little trace of its initial form two men still true to the cause however are and f who for the past few years have been diligently mining the rhythmic and textural vocabularies of both genres in the quest for the perfect synthesis this 12-inch proves no exception s such it sounds a touch dated testimony to how fast trends in bass music evolve (or in many cases de volve) these days ut that isnt to say its unworthy of attention rather for those still hooked on the stepno sound its a real treat the -side is a typically pliant flexing asic channel-meets-2-step roller pitching deeply submerged throbs of bass against gently reverberating chords and a meandering sub-aquatic lead melody fs remix is a whole load tougher bringing granite-chiseled kicks and galloping horseshoe claps (read: clops) to bear on the originals languid groove and stretching out the bass into a tick undulating drone nd while neither has anything radically new to add to the techno/dubstep conversation (more of a weary grumble nowadays) for those still looking for the perfect synthesis is where its at

seem to take a long time to release stuff is their first single of (which you ll see on their forthcoming album) but you ll have to go back to may 2006 for their last effort which was a mix cd yet it s not like anyone has forgotten about the scottish kingpins with the link to glasgow s underground scene and their perennial dates at the tent at t in the park orde meikle and stuart mcmillan are just about untouchable to their fans it s nice to see their name on a product again part 1 is industrial and beautifully crafted sequenced with precision and deep textures yet entirely subtle when the kick drum and techno riff starts this off you might think oh no this clocks in at ten minutes and i ve already got the gist of it but stay tuned: the cut rolls ahead in a surprising and un-annoying fashion with deep warm pads thoughtful synths and delayed fx percussion completing the picture it s over before you know it and you ll want to be hearing this again and again in different environments and in different states (mostly when jacked-up though) part 2 sounds the same but maybe it s more a reluctant-electro-hero darker and lonelier when the synths appear they sound delicate and then anxious gradually gearing up to crescendo and climax very usable good stuff here by making contemporary use of classic sounds certainly piques one s interest in their long-player don t keep us waiting too long now
is the gleaming debut from christopher pak ramos aka record is a blitz of piano sketches glass-sharp melodies ambient fx and bass crashes like a distant relative of the dance floor-engineered tracks on now-defunct predecessor glacial sound but ramos resists arranging his music into club-ready shapes crafting a more cubist take on grime for all their novel contortions these songs have an affecting elegance on the evocatively titled sunsets doom-laden bass gives way to choral synth pads and a beautiful piano loop even the churn of which can be as tumultuous as the name suggests is dappled with synth and flecks of grand piano synchronized strikes the eps most sombre tone two low-octave notes pull the track down depressing the luminous melodies that dazzle throughout ramos condenses his various moods and motifs into the title track a concise expression of the eps tension between utopia and devastation behind light-beam synths and piano slides things are ripped and sliced a hands-on deconstruction of club sounds
jamie krasner is best known as a collabora r whether singing on physical therapys jungle-pop oddity drone on or making records with gobby as seth an album that collects previous singles and a brace of new tracks suggests shes finally giving full attention her own project at first her solo style seems uncomfortably close anothers: the faintly manga cover the icy fog of reverb and the ethereal falset echo pre- art angels gri s but the similarities are only on the surface and krasners songs soon plumb dark depths of their own each side of gravitates wards a style on the a its an update of cocteau twins dream-pop on which krasners voice floats over a watery synth hook might be the prettiest of these; with its jangling chords ticks style boxes more directly the albums second half indulges the trip-hop tendency that has long lurked in krasners downtempo beats the homage is quite direct on the head-nodding and barefaced on where she does her best beth gibbons over plucked double bass and rhodes-like chord clusters throughout the album that fog of reverb keeps everything in a similar emotional zone this wouldnt be a problem if it werent highlighted by so strange sequencing why choose the vague six-minute now ) as your opener instead of skipping the punchier tracks that follow and why bulk out the albums latter half with the formless strumming of r i p or the insubstantial coupled with the odd overlong coda elsewhere these inclusions can make a mono nous listen which is a sha because the record isnt short on strong tracks the best is sockit to a bizarre collision of bleepy techno and a swooning synth-pop lullaby the two styles wrestle for your attention an arc of burbling 303 here a waft of synth pad there but krasner keeps them in a careful checkmate her collaborations have led so unusual alchemies and her solo work does o
the first release on fabrics new label comes from berlin-based brit jr seaton whose most high pr ile release so far episode came on throne blood last year you could throw all sorts labels at his music vivacious and texturally rich as it is and here he tosses it all at the wall revelling in the strange disjointed patterns that result lead track is the star but its an unusual one imagine the breakdown a particularly epic tune stretched out to nine minutes the chords elongated dramatically and drums in permanent bubbling-under stasis the track breathes in and out pulling in shards melody and jarring samples without breaking a sweat leosenger burrows even deeper into techno neuroses with a beat so broken it sounds like several rhythms sloppily laid over each other add in the dangling chimes that sit uneasily against a backdrop static and its like an unsettling actress lullaby grey combines these impulses taking the vast assortment elements from leosenger and strapping them to a more coherent beat its still whispery and moody but is periodically interrupted by rather brash lashings sound including a stellar breakdown that makes you wonder if the track can recover its meek footing (it does ) this exhaustive ep coughs to a finish with the mournful tones a as seaton sets f every synth in his studio for another bustling bouquet sound

mosca has hardly traced a straight line through dance music since he surfaced in 2010 but with the launch of his label hes disappeared down a rabbit hole where his earlier work had traces of uk garage and heavy bass music in its dn the newer stuff taps into something darker and loopier mosca exists between scenes these days taking the muted sheen of classic dub techno and fusing it with the druggy dynamics of peak-era minimal the fourth record offers two of the most seamless examples of this style yet were t with its flanged drum track and topsy-turvy bassline is a ride so bumpy it could cause motion sickness on the flipside is a banging afterhours jam that calls back to moscas basic channel-worshipping last ep full of distantly booming chords and aqueous textures is punchier even with a sickly synth melody that plays like a deflating balloon nsm004 is a reminder that dance music can be minimal and loopy without lacking personality; in fact the ep oozes with it from the wonky synth leads to the strangely graceful arc of its basslines mosca wraps it all in a package you could drop into just about any set
steve reichs 13-minute phasing experiment come out surfaces fitfully in music i first heard samples of the 1966 piece on madlibs shades of lue and then again on his mf doom collaboration madvillainy u n k l e and d*note among many others have also made use of the famous line: come out to show them response to a murder during the 64 harlem riots come out endures as a sonic artifact full of political undertones used on the -side of s debut 12-inch for dnuos ytivil daniel hamms voice is more like a reminder of the debt techno owes reichs rigorous work with repetition the crossover seems more than incidental uoyant and fluid the london-based producers rolling techno seems to occupy a fixed space even as it mutates echoing the way hamms looped words diffuse like gas ell tones soft pads and analogue hums fill out but the effects serve to decorate rather than disturb the rhythm the tracks are also remarkable for how soft their textures are sounding like several gamelan ensembles fed through a shredder s ambient core should sound ugly and nauseating instead it enhances the sense of drift on the more dance-friendly brushed snares unexpectedly take a pivotal role leavening the sub-bass tremors and amplifying the rhythm of the come out sample
techno has been tied to detroits once fabled auto industry since cybotrons alleys of your mind and cosmic s a duo comprising ian r clark and adult s adam lee miller also linked the industry to technos close cousin electro they released a handful of eps in the mid to late 90s through millers ersatz audio label but unless youre an electro head you probably havent heard of though the duos first ep was roughshod the kind of record two submerge fanboys might have made around then quickly developed into something greater reaching their apex with the 97 album matic before miller moved onto adult and clark became perspects -reverse released via following a 7-inch reissue on the label earlier this year collects highlights from the catalogue it isnt the first compilation or even the most comprehensive ersatz audio put out the exhaustive -biography in 2000 but its a welcome look at a discography that deserves a critical reevaluation even though -reverse isnt sequenced chronologically it gives you an idea of the groups development and more importantly their sense of humour from s final batch of original material 98s -motif is a fantastically silly intro in which one robot invites another for a drive as they listen to electro it fuses the experience of driving with electro music itself a sort of meta commentary that underlines the difference between s electro and the political energy and out-there ideas of some of their detroit contemporaries the compilations music can be split into two camps: raw bare bones electro where percussive and melodic elements are hard to distinguish and mature compositions that foreground melody and atmosphere the latter tracks have more character but the former are dance floor gold tracks like five and the stomping from the duos debut ep -fuel convey their appeal instantly bass-heavy and catchy this is electro with swagger where make every element count when they go straight to the core of the genre as with 15 (sprang) the mischief of their skeletal robo-funk calls back to the most joyous dance floor moments of mid-80s electro the tracks from the matic album are another story entirely and have hummable melodies and killer drum programming; the handclaps on the latter are enough to make you wish it was twice as long tracks like meanwhile illustrate how quickly the group grew after their first two records reinforcing the steel-and-glass template of their earlier sound with gut-punching kicks and hi-resolution synths thing that -reverse has over -biography is a previously unreleased track that shows the duos knack for arrangement its many moving parts are expertly positioned and the crushed overdriven synth lead is exactly the right kind of wrong an aggressive moment with a lighthearted touch there is such variety within s sound theres also the cybotron-esque and the drexciyan that its hard not to wonder where else they could have gone had they stuck together -reverse is essentially a history lesson albeit a fun one and a chance to take a second look at an underappreciated chapter of the detroit electro canon

coming into his tenth year san franciscan dj and producer seth horvitz shows neither signs of slowing down or running out of ideas his latest and third on soul jazz s electronica imprint comes hard on the back of his monumental remix set on leaf a retrospective mix cd of his own context label and even a soundtrack for locally produced black and white film pathogen and as always you never know quite whether to expect glitch soundscapes house or underground resistance inflected harder tracks notes from doctor island combines a bit of everything with the correct doses of saturday night urgency home listening and horvitz s sculptural talents key however is rhythm and not algorhythm as so rightly puts it in this sense the a-side the easily escapes the unnecessary complications of idm despite the fact that buried beneath the venomous pop acid exterior you can hear a computer destroying itself under the strain and heat of an anxious data overload yet there is far too much propulsion and dark sentient energy in the woven dub textures airy blips and lost voices to let the logical machine rule as it might in other hands on the other side is lighter but cut from the same cloth immediately catchy it pierces the scratchy glitch polyrythms with a light whirl of shining melodies more late night than dance floor but equally intriguing a short ep overall but both sides are as hard to resist as they are to pin down even after ten years continues to compel while still managing to cross uneven terrain
considering who it comes from the titular lead track from s fifth album is surprising a big kick and metronomic bassline rises at 125 bpm as a rubbery sawtooth sequence modulated hi-hats and a staccato riff work their way into the mix its the kind of muscular techno that could launch a set full of druggy power but not what axel willner s hypno-loop stalwart has made his name on by his standards is an exercise in abandon midway through theres a moment that could almost pass for a drop starts with its brawniest track but a few others are among willners most physical productions its elegant melody notwithstanding could be an acidic cousin to section 25s looking from a hilltop with a grand sweep not to mention liberal use of chorus on the bassline that evokes the 80s classic verit is also full of urgency galloping forth as if straining to break free of its loopy structure like and the song has a propulsive dynamism and therein lies the rub: trading some vibey texture and introspective ambience for dance floor potency willner sacrifices a degree of his core appeal after all his knack for mingling sensuous intimacy with fantastical grandeur is what made s best records so rewarding defined by repetition and mesmerizing as ever isnt a huge stretch for willner its best moments are in the second half when the music revels in ethereality gently shuffling glides through an ocean of echo as hints of plaintive melody beckon from the shoreline gazes upward with shards of radiant sun straining to break through its cloudy sky album closer is wilner at his most romantic it almost sounds religious with its gentle layers of brass- and harmonium-like timbres its interesting when pushes in a new direction but these three tracks are willner doing what he does best conjuring dreamlike soundtracks for meditative reveries

after the brilliant jeff bennett ep on eq grey ltd the label kicks back into gear with a release from pj davy danny graham the track is and it comes with an original mix and a remix from dave robertson from dr robotnik fame a track on james zabiela s hearing aid imprint the original mix is a nice and jumpy production with upbeat drums and interesting effects a uniquely arranged production this track flows quite minimally with the baseline becoming more intense deep into the track one but can t help feel that this track needs a loud sound system to do it justice the dave robertson mix on the flip definitely livens things up the drums and hi hats are intensified and smooth warm pads smother the track for the most part the baseline is a little chunkier and is noticeable almost from the word go and in general the production is a little more lively and less minimal than the original a pretty good release for eq grey a label that is keen to show the diversity that exists amongst its artists signed
is a label event series and production project by a bergen based artist in the same universe as sotofett and svn with whom hes collaborated in the past its easy to see why he gets along with those guys like them he has a skewed and minimalistic take on club music thats all about texture and atmosphere but while sex tags and sued often conjure warm balmy settings explores an altogether darker place a pair of murky thumpers from and is no exception both tracks here sound like theyre bobbing and weaving through a dusky swamp an effect achieved in part through heavy panning and lots of bird calls a by and is a tunneling groove assembled from gummy kicks woody toms and a pad as soothing as it is eerie on b essentially a remix of the a side keeps the pad and the swampy atmosphere but fleshes it all out more this 15 minute epic is full of small but unexpected moments like the breaks that flutter in after seven minutes the chords that come out of nowhere a while later and the rain and thunder in the beatless coda im partial to the simpler original but both are vivid hypnotic and impressively banging if in their own dark and woozy way

whether they realise it or not millions of people know the music of after all the tokyo producers childlike melodies have bleeped out of consoles across the world as the soundtrack to the ape escape games until then seemed to be playing a game of his own one that could be called deep simulator the early 90s onwards s far east recordings has specialised in eastern impressions of western deep house on hunee compiles the best of s tracks for rush hour alongside a few from his compatriot parts of are like the aural equivalent of amerikamura the osaka district with a model statue of liberty and the stars and stripes strewn in every window but whereas that neighbourhood retains a sense of japanese character beneath all the americana s take on us house and garage isnt just indistinguishable from its original source its just as good as the real deal with its pounding piano and diva vocal is a house cut masters at work would be proud of too is loaded with new york flavour s love for that city was reciprocated when larry levan remixed shower a track he produced in 1989 for the japanese singer nami shimada that one appears here as a reworked instrumental with beefed up disco stabs crisper drum fills and a faint echo of madonnas vogue but these guys werent only looking to the us for inspiration: rips gaznevadas alo classic i c affair for and and all have a breezy 80s balearic vibe some tracks hint at s future career: and are as cute and bouncy as a japanese video game character you might also say theyve got about as many dimensions at least in emotional terms although can do chilled upbeat jazzy deep and soulful sounds with equal aplomb the mood of each track is normally just a variation on deliriously happy but that makes them fun to jump between and will have many house heads grinning for a full hour
ben stefanski is among a growing list of artists faltydl slugabed machinedrum who has lifted from the planet mu roster stefanski signed with the label in 2011 after a couple of singles on planet mu and has since seen his brand of electronic avant-soul supported heavily by the uks radio 1 stefanskis third release comprises four new tracks that introduce his own vocals lifted from his forthcoming album the title track layers love letter emotion over an undercurrent of broken bass lullaby-like in structure and sensuous in tone its initially a touch mawkish but soon the contrasting components gel with harmonious results a melancholic cover of hot natured ali loves follows in an equally delicate manner its not quite as absorbing as but the tracks transformation into a dour soul number clearly showcases stefanskis vision a mournful collaboration entitled with female vocalist yadi falls flat but a brooding arpeggio-propelled electronica track completes the ep in the arresting fashion it began
has an exceptional roster voices from the lake dino sabatini abdulla rashim rank among its most acclaimed associates but owner tom bonaty has recently been treading a noble path by only releasing music from unknown producers last octobers bens wolves was the solo debut from new italian producer mod21 and next is a 12-inch from american tim westcott aka wndfrm like mod21s release wndfrms formal variant is a subdued drawn-out and heady techno trip exactly the kind of thing has become known for formal variant contains two side-long tracks totalling 25 minutes of music those familiar with will know that bonaty cares little about what works in the club and this ep is testament to that both cuts are heavily atmospheric and about as chilled as gets but they strike a perfect balance between groove and ambience is the livelier of the two with organic-sounding drums and steadily building white noise and synth stabs on the more ambient droning bass is paired with more white noise and restrained drums its hard to say which track is more satisfying so its best to listen to this ep in one go
grimes resurgence has been much discussed but for many young artists thats only part of the story in the uk and beyond producers are drawing on a globally sourced toolbox of signifiers for their club-ready hybrids: grimes gun-cocks and bass pulses alongside the rolling syncopations of baltimore and jersey club the ballroom scenes ubiquitous ha sample and so on the borders of this latter scene are perhaps a little more permeable than most still nobody has yet attempted a collaboration quite like this is gages return to following his debut single from earlier this year telo marked the british producer as one of the more aggressive and rhythmically adventurous of the uks current crop but particularly on shiftin his pursuit of new rhythms gave his grooves a certain disjointedness the same problem might be said to apply to his latest which constantly stepladders in intensity from pummelling downbeat thud to grimes whipcrack propulsion might that is if it werent for the involvement of philadelphias kevin jz prodigy a revered ballroom commentator and producer prodigy effortlessly rises to gages challenge delivering a raw-throated barrage of ballroom witticisms and syllabic machinegun fire the two egg one another on their ever-escalating rhythmic gymnastics enough to pin you to the nearest wall for the duration prodigys concluding oh is a chest-thumping sign-off but it could equally be an exclamation of surprise at the dynamite this unlikely pairing has produced

latest 12 on botchit scarper features two cuts taken from the forthcoming remix album of s debut lp you are here that album combined rock hip hop house turntablism techno and breakbeats and raised the bar for future breaks artist albums here dreaming and the album title track you are here get the remix treatment from two of breakbeats most respected artists b l i m and ils the original dreaming was as its title suggested a dreamy piece - equally at home at the end of a chemical brothers album when tom and ed usually spiral into psychedelica b l i m s remix combines s dreamy elements and a percussive break consisting of a gung-ho kick drum pattern and buzzing bass tone techy atmospheric tones accompany the original bass melody as elements of the arpeggiated synth and the hypnotic we are dreaming vocal are progressively added in like the original this remix is suited for end of night shenanigans as the lights come on and its time to go home atmospheric breaks maestro ils adds his magic touch to the final and title track of s longplayer you are here the mix starts with a crisp drum break and clever synth work before ils introduces the deep bassline the blues harmonica and sublime sweet hustler vocal from the original after the main break these elements carry the track together with a female vocal hook and plenty of background synth work to be honest deep atmospheric breaks arent my thing and i was hoping the vinyl remixes would have included the girl is filth both remixes are good but seem more suited to lounge rooms than club floors
s moniker stems from his pick n mix approach to dance musics three-decade back catalogue his output mostly for hypercolour and as here its offshoot takes in swaggering two-step bumping new jersey house and now flashes of jungle hes arguably about 12 months behind the curve and his takes on those sounds certainly dont match the likes of tessela or special request but he does have a knack for fashioning straight-up floor shakers take the new vip mix of recent move d fabric mix highlight which peppers brandys i wanna be down acapella with whipcrack breakbeats when the bassline wobbles into view its devastating unfortunately nothing else is quite as effective especially which marries trancey arpeggios to burial-lite beats that no self-respecting producer should be touching in opener wont is equally uninspiring deconstructing its breaks la paul woolford but lacking his vision the one moment that doesnt seem entirely in thrall to other records is a barebones house strut its one-note bassline ringing through lightly swung drums that clatter and crack in a cajmere vein its effective precisely because of its restraint
is a jaunty electro number recorded live to tape from hardware by glasgows dave clark back in 1998 it was released in 2002 as part of the first release on stuffrecords one of the glasgow labels that would eventually form the powerhouse family its a pretty unassuming song theres a catchy melody at its heart that makes it easy to love and the bright synth that eventually overwhelms the track is pretty gnarly somewhere along the way it became an enduring favourite for some of the worlds most admired djs among them ricardo who was tapped for a remix once the crew discovered hed been playing it in typical fashion the berlin artist turns in a two-part 31-minute remix that takes a good 15 minutes to get going part one rewrites the track as a slow house number on first glance merely stretches out the lead and puts a flaccid kick drum underneath it there are plenty of weird little touches though with ribbons of sound flitting about in his microscopic ecosystem what at first feels listless turns hypnotic but its the 20-minute part two that takes the cake it starts where the first left off but soon unravels into something unrecognizable more like a original which certainly isnt a bad thing and as recent goes its one of his more club-friendly tracks as it spools bits of sound around the leaden kick drum as if they were clay time-stretching artefacts and volume fluctuations only add to the disorientation like his excellent remix of envoys seawall its a transportive effort with a few bumps in the road that make it all totally worth it to sweeten the deal have included two extra tracks sourced from the same 1998 session that birthed jigsaw easily stands up to the title track making up for the lack of a melodic hook with a sense of robotic funk and violent drexciya-style synths st is an ambient trifle that doesnt add much to the package but at only a minute and a half it isnt exactly wasting your time an unexpected but welcome surprise the reissue shines light on an obscure gem and offers up a mind-bending 30 minutes as a bonus
italian producer is a good fit for gang of ducks: his music is every bit as beguiling as the labels past five releases all four tracks here are built on rhythms that feel like they can barely maintain momentum and like the recent shape worship release h o p e bleeds fluidly through genres the lagging drums on are mere texture behind a cascading wall of synths imagine a marching band trying to play kassem mosse percussion is more prominent on an industrial-inspired tune with the same mournful fake brass now coloured with anxiety hinges on an acrid drum break and what sounds like a dusty bollywood sample while a weary trudge through dense sonic muck the track is half dance half abstract sound design it wouldnt be the easiest thing to fit into a dj set but it would certainly stand out the remixes dont do much to groom the tracks for dance floors or improve them at all for that matter best s sparse-to-a-fault remix sprinkles elements of the original over a bassline that wriggles back and forth gang of ducks themselves offer up a techno-oriented rework that struggles to break out of an impenetrable wall of filters youre better off with the originals
finally thomas melchior might have done something subtle enough to get him noticed years melchior s productions such as those on superlongevity compilations fitted so neatly into s sound aesthetic that they passed under many a radar some of melchior s previous records even appeared bland on surface listen you had to bend your ears into the groove and rotate the volume dial another ninety degrees clockwise before you caught the gist and if you played his tracks on shitty sound-systems in noisy bars (as i was doing at that time) melchior s would be the ones that could have accused you of being a plip-plop dj not once or twice but three times while playing a melchior record i was asked by a loud punter in rude hip-hop attire if i had any jay-z it would be pointless to tell to such a person to listen more carefully or that this was a kind of minimalism as camouflage can i sneak in the phrase cloaking device without admitting too much space geek baggage but in fact it s all about space and not the whooshy 70s kind that lindstr m feels; melchior s is more the 80s nasa flight of the navigator sort and mostly for the way the spacecraft in that film could alter its shape to make it even faster or maybe that s too cheesy not modernist enough maybe his is closer to kubrick s vision of space: rotate the tone-pot hal let the bass kick hal etcetera those who ve seen the slices interview will have seen the huge picture of the astronaut on the wall or the banks and banks of korg electribes in his studio: were they chosen for their precise crisp sound or their banks and banks of flashing lights since seeing the doco i always imagine melchior sitting in the dark navigating his way through the groove and maybe that s the way he did make only thing that would complete the picture would be if the roof of his house opened to expose the night sky above last year s different places ep marked the pinnacle of a long trajectory where melchior finally found his present mature style and could aim his spacecraft right into the (no) disco future both sides of the ep were like massive precisely drawn arcs that curved you through a ten minute journey taking all the time in the world (or between worlds) to get from a to b simply because that s how long it took even with the warp drive whirring and the stars dragging past in lines this was space navigation bar by bar star by star to detractors this is precisely what makes melchior s music quintessentially boring it takes too long and does too little well maybe jay-z s more your thang some people who really dug the promo mix version of have also complained along similar lines saying that the unmixed album gives you less by offering more and that these tracks only make sense in the mix maybe true but to me there s something about the tranquility of letting the full-length versions of the tracks glide by glide they do right from start to finish i could talk about various tracks but it seems pointless to single out landmarks when talking about music who s strongest quality is the sense of wheeling through open space with the smoothness and speed of light i can t say that will captivate everyone inevitably an album with a drag co-efficient as low as this will leave a lot of listeners (and even the wind) with very little to grab onto but when such quicksilver velocity is the objective of the sound design you d have to say that this is one spaceship that reaches its destination
since its launch three years ago has released a slow stream of hypnotic intriguingly organic techno informed by label boss dino sabatinis love of greek mythology sabatini himself has been credited on each of its releases so far three of which featured appearances from fellow rome artists for the fifth mnemosyne hes linked up with glasgows edit-select (real name tony scott) following a collaborative effort on the latters phlox lp for prologue earlier in the year the three tracks lean towards sabatinis style and fit with the more restrained stuff in the outis catalog the slightly syncopated kick drum of offers some tribal funk but the track is perhaps too passive overall with light percussive textures and eerie drones stirring in the distance and are both stronger standalone tracks and more solid as tools is a smooth-chugging 4/4 track that features a slicing hi-hat and endlessly offbeat echo-laden tremors tremors that also burrow their way beneath the surface of that one has half-time drums balanced by an acidic bass throb and is otherwise filled with a colorful assortment of beeps and softly whistling pads which helps bring the record to a warm tranquil conclusion
hasnt released a solo record under his own name in ten years but only because he has been occupied with his other projects most recently the deviant sounds of broken english club the 20th anniversary of blueprint the label behind much of hos early output ends that streak with a four-track ep revisiting his skills as a techno craftsman the broken-beat title track is geared for peak-time demolition its modulated squelches and stormy reverb making the whole thing feel like it could explode on ambient cut the ping-ponging percussion and prickly greyscale atmosphere usher in what sounds like a voice drenched in effects a sense of humanity however inscrutable has been a ho hallmark since the beginning a 4/4 cut with a huge distorted lead and incisive hi-hat rushes is the standout its one-riff no-bullshit techno at its most commanding s slightly subdued percussion offers more open space but its eventually saturated with nerve-wracking energy the title says it all is a fiery release from ho
i need the dark menacing edginess back thats how pinch described his dissatisfaction with the uk dance climate in a short interview with f ct on the subject of his new cold recordings imprint label is intended to explore the fertile territory between 120 and 130 bpm imbued with the moody vibe pinch pines for its first release is a promising one from relative unknown and cardiff native has the four-to-the-floor kick thats become ubiquitous in uk music but saddled to a wormy bassline straight off a vintage shackleton record with a tapestry of rough vocal samples (deep and male rather than garages feminine chirps) and a synth line that sounds like its gasping for air theres a thick and paranoid atmosphere to the whole thing is altogether more friendly smooth and polished like marble both its central refrain and the sections in between feel dangerous like they could bust loose at any moment where its flipside was panicky this one uses the sleeker side of darkness a sinister flip of the current garage revival its hard to say what exactly separates it from pinchs tectonic output but either way s debut slots nicely into a growing cohort of producers re-excavating the depths of the uks urban anxiety
s promotional antics have earned him a reputation as an unpredictable provocateur just as he straddles genres drawing in elements of techno ebm post-punk and no wave his persona seems driven by an impulse do whatever other people are not doing by plastering pissed-off emails from steve lbini on billboards putting his own email address on public display and running a promotional campaign based on crushing watermelons hes created a series of surprising cryptic and at times grating spectacles that have forced attention on his music clever since thats exactly the spirit of the music itself s music is based on an impossible separation of body and brain a desire stretch the mind with endless synthesizer offshoots while commandeering the body with pummelling drums and m-led beats this separation defines his first full-length released on tracks like beat and ndy place your head one place and your feet another that is whenever lets the groove ferment for more than 20 seconds at a time elsewhere the album is painted in the colours youd expect from a record tracks like and reinforce an elemental connection the dance floor brasive samples echo the driving influence of bands like front 242 and suicide backed by stellar vocal appearances from jonnine standish of htrk voice nestles neatly in the records stark synth bursts representing a departure from s early eps ny forays in homage are offset by the albums pervading presentism most tracks have a near- tal lack of reverb that suffocates sentimentality without starving the record of atmosphere s a listening experience its like pushing on a bleeding gum: knotty and perversely satisfying is far more than an exercise in trolling or deft guerrilla marketing this is what happens when brings mind and body gether in the context of the dance floor the result is a staggering experience even if its all in your head

theres a certain power in sounding like you dont quite know what youre doing have it in spades clearly they know how house music is supposed to work they just tweak it enough so that each and every time you play one of their tracks you do a tiny double take their latest one-sider for the ever-reliable imprint is yet another entry in their increasingly just -strange catalogue the track like much of their output is a hair-too-long for home listeners and the perfect length for djs t nine minutes though the track-y number does just enough to keep your interest either way coupling a faint echo of the sort of dubby effect that levon vincent often applies to his tracks and a shuffling drum track the duo plot out a surprisingly insistent 110 bpm pattern before adding a quavering synth and rubbery bassline it proudly drops elements in and out picking up a single handclap in a concert hall a hip-hop vocal sample and a counter-rhythm along the way adding more incongruous bits to the stew that theyre incongruous of course is exactly the point its not exactly dj koze-level madness but its just enough for you to sit up and take notice nd isnt that why we listen to music
on uses the wreckage of drum bass as a springboard for textures that sound handmade though the nuts and bolts of these four tracks are built with weapons-grade precision its the tactile details that stay with you take opener : youre rolling along on tonnes of sub-bass and ice cold trails of ambience but it also sounds like theres a rake dragging through a rock garden the ep works like a petri dish thats spawning all sorts of mutant bacteria even as the hands behind the experiment feel satisfyingly human is a highlight thanks to the diminished melody that drifts plaintively over barreling triplets youd be loath to call it a hook but its mixture of eerie foreboding and bloody-handed glee lingers long in the ear has another memorable melodic figure which is comparatively sanguine given the serrated acid line tearing a hole down the tracks middle evokes the recent grey area records but youd be missing the point if you narrowed its charms down to mere rhythmic utility the whole thing bubbles up steadily like a giant sentient blob swallowing a city and has done a remarkable job making the tune feel like a single unit of mass despite keeping all of its elements neatly separated these tracks all push a pervasive mood but if you can see past the raw shock theres a wealth of singular nuance in
londoner is the kind of dubstep producer who gives tracks titles like and face melt but dont get him confused with the aggro junkies that have run rampant with the genre: tim langridge is a devout disciple of style dubstep ten tonnes heavy without the fratboy tendencies like s best (especially last years stellar remix of truths puppets ) has the feeling that its violently throwing itself on the ground in some horrifying fit of flagellation completely ruthless the snares hit like knockout punches and when the beat skips three times at the end of the bars its a brutal finishing blow langridge has a knack for the much abused lfo and it courses through like coagulated blood unpleasant but spectacularly powerful in its caustic gurgling centering around what sounds like glass knocking against glass lame is a straightforward roller with tense speech samples and eerie strings though the songs one two punch kick pattern carries an impact more powerful than most its a fairly pedestrian affair especially in comparison to the brutal pyrotechnics of
is a pretty mundane name for a dance music producer but the music alex markey makes is anything but a prominent member of the secondnature crew a young group of producers and djs from seattle and tacoma who are reinvigorating the washington regions techno scene markey embodies their ethos imagine the mystical drama of northern electronics mixed with the lush atmospherics of sandwell district and a dose of quality songwriting that was the vibe on markeys excellent pathfinder ep from earlier this year now hes working with seattles motor label another key player in the citys techno scene motor boss samuel melancon has said he wants his labels techno to be bright accessible and fun markey does just that on bookending the ep with two boisterous tracks is roomy built on a broken beat with bright glossy arpeggios the more it chugs along especially once the sputtering bassline gets in there the more it sounds inspired by some old prog track and its all the better for it the title cut is a function-style banger with bright bell sounds but theres also a world of atmospheric detail to take in markey gets darker in the midsection is deep and trippy techno and though its well-built its bass-heavy growl and burping synths feel humdrum next to the more distinctive tracks on the other hand is almost kitschy like its got a mischievous bassline hand percussion and a robotic sample that deadpans decibels over and over its a little goofy but it sticks to motors idea of unpretentious techno

is deep house a synonym for nostalgia nowadays listening to the output on the newly minted label one could be forgiven for thinking so antonzap was responsible for the imprints first release on the back of a very well-received ep on underground quality and novices follow up here with an ep so dripping with analogue warmth that its like the bastard offspring of an orgy between theo parrish kenny dixon jr and etienne de crecys super discount project the original is a mid-paced affair ideal for the warm-up and makes use of similar sonic motifs to mark es slave 1 its lush chords delicately prod poke and undulate with a restrained intensity that threatens to blossom but in the end just teases the harry and remix sacrifices some of the opulent texture of the original for a sparser percussive workout while retaining the bassline its a slightly more muscular excursion that sits nicely between s mix and quarion rerub the drumpoet community vet supplies the disco bullets with a more souped-up workout that takes the vocal and leaves it relatively deep in the mix where it has to be content to never quite get out of garage purgatory
makes his proper debut on with an ep inspired by what he terms tribalism particularly the cut-up broken-beat aesthetic of early 90s hip-hop seizing on the percussive assault of his past records is murky groovy and packed to the gills with drums that add a tinge of hypnotism to parasoles tough-guy techno is the eps standout cutting a long and syncopated path through swampy atmospherics imagine one of donato dozzys most psychedelic moments but with a more earthen palette its entrancing as it twists and turns for what feels like eternity and its one of parasoles most distinctive tracks yet carries over those deeper-than-deep atmospherics for a more traditional techno job dressing up the pounding kick drums with eerie tubular bells melodies and distant whooshes that sound like field recordings of paranormal activity the title track is the simplest thing here and though its half-hearted melody feels like an afterthought the killer drum work nearly makes up for it it rounds off a solid ep that offers some of parasoles most personal and unusual material
lex koenig can make music out of anything his hands all audio sources tv movies news broadcasts radio video games or random ephemera are raw material for his dense and seamless soundscapes first emerging in the vaporwave sphere after a spell as a heavy metal drummer koenig has injected the sample-based genre with a healthy dose of musicality and adventure nd now that the scene has largely moved on to other styles koenig responds by making something more psychedelic more complex and more overwhelming than any vaporwave album theres ever been lot happens in s first few minutes swampy n n is a flurry of signifiers from across the cultural spectrum from a sample of yellos oh yeah to an instantly recognizable sound effect from pac-man its as though hes sifting through collective childhood memories and making a track out of them best part comes with a sudden burst of gospel-tinged vocals and drums which kicks into full gear just two songs into its 26-track runtime koenig likes to keep listeners guessing with these sudden shifts b ss///cop starts out like a breaks track with clips of britney spears im slave 4 u before that song suddenly busts out in full itll get you every time he likes to swipe rhythms from dance music too before building on them in unexpected ways twists jungle into mangled shapes messes with uk hardcore plays around with chemical brothers-style big beat and then melts it down into silky vaporwave albums constantly shifting attention span echoes the stoner hip-hop of madlib y also bring to mind the work of mash-up artist girl talk who would stitch hundreds of pop songs together into giddy party jams but koenigs spread of sounds is more diffuse and familiar sounds bubble up as quickly as theyre drowned out by something else he likes to cross generations and stretch samples beyond recognition in an approach that resembles plunderphonics its vaporwaves logical endpoint where a love of sampling and pitch-shifting becomes overwhelming in an everything-all-the-time state a trek through slogging drums and samples espousing the evils of marijuana is the apex of koenigs mind-boggling style its by turns grating frightening and thrilling and at nine minutes its the albums densest song s much of a sensory overload as it may seem in isolation on its just a small piece of a larger puzzle made out of what feels like a million tiny pieces its an album so vast and confusing that whenever you lose your bearings youll usually find something new to enjoy each time
dave seamans label is one of the last outposts of straight up progressive house a genre that started losing steam about five years and ten global undergrounds ago perhaps presaging a dim future seamans kept his approach lean and mean foregoing pricy vinyl pressings and releasing comps strictly on cd so far there have been two discs in the across borders series a strange name as each stayed strictly within borders of one particular nation focusing on producers from greece and the netherlands season specific comps sprung up last april with spring/summer and now autumn/winter is the next logical plod along there are ten tracks in all here from the likes of heavies and along with returning across borders greeks and rookie is up first contributing the dub of his garden track this is safe prog house to the utmost which in 00 means its a lot snoozier than it has any right to be (especially as the comps fishhook lead in) s lolitas fares better a track heavy on keyboard slams but mercifully not reeking of vintage house limburger lewis s is a moodier version of lifelike chris menaces discopolis; its quite good for the first couple spins but the synths get whinier and the bass more obnoxious with each repeat play has been s golden boy up till now pushing out a massive remix of phil k s cloudbrake in 00 and dealing up the devastating phat laces last year under his needless guise returns on autumn/winter with freds which boasts a great name but sounds anything but; all filler no killer however has yet to slip up on production duties wheres dub might be another sad little glitch along but its a compelling listen nonetheless with a tremendous bass drop to boot (g pals takes a nicely twisted route as the comp rounds home ending up on s complicated things arent quite normal to begin with as prog houses typically head bashing / is eschewed for a slightly more broken beat getting more and more syncopated it enters electro territory for a little while before letting in a serious acid spinal drip then comes a full on breakbeat knob jobbed with some trademark melbourne efx wizardry and bam a truly great track start to finish too bad they cant all be like that if vinyl were still a viable medium for prog house in its death throes you could pick and choose a couple of this comps gems and leave the rest for the birds as it stands however autumn/winter is like a variety pack of mini cereal boxes: once all the good ones are eaten youre left with ordinary old corn flakes
few acts in recent memory have bridged the gap between rock and dance music like bob moses depending on the track jimmy vallance and tom howie sound like they belong in a blues bar or a packed nightclub and they flit between the two modes effortlessly new york duos first few records on scissor thread played with that dichotomy take the slow-burning highlight hands to hold y cleverly presented that track in two ways: an acoustic version centered around howies vocals and a club version showing off the kind of sweaty groove that bob moses kick up so well last year they signed to indie giant with an ep that found them in a comfortable middle ground y stay in that zone on debut album bolstering their sound with stronger hooks and tighter songs s the pairs most professional and accomplished work though also their least adventurous with its generally moody attitude can feel a bit one-note which is partly due to how well the producers have established their sound in just three years from the moment the foreboding piano and chunky drum machines drop into sulking opener vallance and howie make their presence known most of is a variation on the same themes and ingredients: dissolving relationships infidelity wounded guitar licks and a warm low-end pulse se two are exceedingly good at this way they buoy their songs on deep enveloping basslines gives the music a sultry embrace ing about his new album with billboard howie said our production and our writing process is basically the same which is key to understanding how their music works: sound design and production flourishes are as important as the guitars lyrics and songwriting shows how bob moses can work the dance floor with its heavy clanking beat and a catchy chorus that streams out naturally like streaks of sunlight strong production values and candle-lit atmospheres particularly the reverb on the vocals and the soft-focus feel of the keyboards keep s wee-hours flicker engaging even when the minor key melodies mush together this is the kind of debut album that comes after years of hard work one that perfects a sound rather than re-invents it bob moses arent trying to surprise you and if you like what theyve done before then youll find lots to love here ronically even if is the bands least club-ready record it falls victim to the trap that ensnares most techno albums: too much of the same all lined up in a row duo remains an electrifying live act where they link their songs together like a dj set nstead of capturing that feeling focuses on the bands smoky bedroom-ready style s only half the story but its still a pretty good one
heres a tip if youre a newbie to buying vinyl online: if youre looking through the store catalog and the artist name says theo p rrish this means that the release is sold out such is the case for theos latest album sketches which came out on wax last year and then disappeared into the ether so fast that you could practically feel the gust of wind that whisked those lps out the door vinyl junkies who missed out on a theo fix however can still cop this 12-inch which features two extremely bugged out cuts from the full-length the opening bassline from is caked in grit and subterranean skank wobbling and warbling through a hypnotic set of permutations theos goblin-treated rap/chant floats overhead for a long long while until youve lost your bearings and then a driving detroit low-end kicks in noodle-y spaced-out and murky as hell it definitely shows the guy feeling free as he needs to be on the flip the inscrutably titled [email protected] further cements a certain parallel between parrish and sly stone say around the time of theres a riot goin on when slys composing style went from radio-friendly to brooding and brilliantly eccentric 360 exudes a weird lo-fi warmth that sounds like its being played off a reel-to-reel originality of melodic elements and strong instrumental chops often set parrish apart from his contemporaries and here the keys and guitar coalesce into loose patterns that unfurl like the curlicues of cigarette smoke underpinned by gorgeous rhodes playing that gives the whole thing a velvety in silent way comedown vibe for some reason its merely twelve minutes long
kenny hawkes is a well-travelled man one of the uks hardest working dj exports hes djd pretty much everywhere in the world covering all continents with his own brand of house music for hawkes its all about feeling the love of a club crowd rather than getting any commercial clout and it seems his agreement to mix for nrk was a result of the spinners already signed up to the nite:life series as youd expect its a good solid set from kenny not spectacular in a search for podium moments but gaining respect with every hearing rare cuts abound from the stockholm producer aril brikka to brother of soul brikkas closing habotvatt is peak time fodder whilst hawkes himself turns in a great remix of marys its over very hummable more familiar to house heads perhaps will be clydes serve it up here in a brooks hiphouse guise plus annies vocal on i will get on the joshua mix included here however this mix is better heard as a whole unit with the nocturnal house grooves casting their hypnotic spell perfect as a warm-up cd or a set to extend the night
8 years after the original release s born slippy nuxx gets a revival for dancefloors for with 4 remixes on offer for drumnbass breaks and progressive tastes whats interesting about the original tune is that it came out during a period in dance music when hardcore rave music was the in thing (and usually the happy hardcore version of the sound ) once this tune dropped it brought an alternative take to rave music made the movie trainspottings soundtrack a must buy and got everyone singing about the lager lager lager vinyl 1 side a - 12 mix starting off with a melodic piano line the remix is a more musical version of the original tune the new version doesnt retain those classic and very memorable synth stabs at the beginning of the tune that are known to get any crowd whistling and raising their hands in the air the original tribal drums are kept however this time they remain in the shadow of the piano riff and karl hydes classic vocals have our tastes gone softer since 1996 vinyl 1 side b - london elektricity remix speeding things up to drumnbass tempo is the london elektricity remix it starts off as half tempo drumnbass on a tribal beats tip before going at it full slog into drumnbass territories karl hydes vocals have been sped up to suit the beats and you cant help but think it almost sounds like the chipmunks doing theyve included a new piano riff to the remix and during the breakdown the original synth stabs get revisited for a quick cameo not bad for a sped up remix into drumnbass vinyl 2 side a - paul oakenfold remix oakey takes the tune on a trancey progressive ride and starts it off with a rumbling bassline before introducing karls vocals to the mix it features a steady 4/4 beat and also some clever 303 work in the background during the breakdown oakenfold introduces breakbeats to the mix a hard bassline and then cuts it all out and goes back to the original four to the floor theme teasin vinyl 2 side b - atomic hooligan mix from the breaks fraternity theyve enlisted the help of breaks nutters atomic hooligan for a breaky take on the theme the hooligans have taken the tribal drums and layered them on top of a highly danceable breakbeat quite similar to the original 96 tune - both relying solely on karls vocals and drums the synth samples from the original are brought back during the breakdown - a really long breakdown which features karls vocals in full before the breaks kick back in again until the end of the song
nascent imprint well worth keeping an eye on has its sights set firmly on the techno/dubstep hinterland its first release susus small hours / taurean was promising sounding not unlike peverelist on a heavy basic channel tip but this one really ups the ante (dettmann and klock have both twigged on) deftly traversing the sounds of berlin bristol and london without ever sounding forced is classic berghain techno a frosty cartwheeling fist-pumper simultaneously jacking and austere that thanks to impressively economical design (its almost a tool) cries out for heavy mixing retains the driving momentum of the -side cranking up the tempo to the mid-130s but veers off on a 2-step tangent with swung kicks and burning sub-bass over which a sizzling chord stab flickers and flutters with toxic magnetism; fans of 2562 jus wan and f take note meanwhile makes straight for south london recalling kryptic minds in its bleak half-stepping doggedness and while a tad less dynamic than its predecessors (moody skanking is the order of the day) closes out the record in pleasingly heads-down fashion
ill admit to being among those who had counted out: after 2004s becalmed but pretty its all around you it seemed that the post-rock pioneers had succumbed to what you might call the sonic youth problem having been so influential in their earlier years each band seemed either content or doomed to produce a series diminishing but comfortably familiar returns but while eternal sees sy still trapped in the straitjacket sounding exactly like what youd expect a sonic youth album to sound like beacons ancestorship wriggles free to reveal a that not only ducks expectations but one that hasnt soun d this hungry or this satisfying in years to do so they havent left behind their usual dub jazz kraut and minimal influences but instead have leavened them with nods towards everything from dubstep ( ) to punk ( ) to err that one song on daft punks discovery that soun d like vi o game church music ( ) re is a consistent sound to this album holding all these disparate influences together and after the overly polished and smooth its all around you its a nice surprise to find out that seem to have a pronounced fondness for fuzzed out synthesizers distortion in general and tight but occasionally unintuitive rhythm section interplay five guys in have been working together for so well and so long and are all so individually accomplished that they can move from the syncopated sinuous likes to the coarsely chopped synthesizers the brief interlu penubra to the headlong stop/start charge without it ever feeling disjointed or unnatural what really unites the songs here isnt sound or production style or instrumentation though is a certain compositional intelligence and for the first time in years ferocity first six songs here in particular sound out for blood; unlike some s previous work there isnt a ton space in these tracks for listener reflection soaring insistent single for example makes for great driving music but isnt that suited to contemplation never really served their reputation as eggheads but here they havent just rejected the kind thinking that had people calling them math-rock theyve obliterated it rhythms and repetitions throughout are just slightly too f-kilter for me to say that you could dance to this album but it will have your head nodding fiercely res an appealingly visceral element to even the slower tracks on this album the album slows down from the frantic first section downshifting into a more mid-paced groove giving the overarching impression that this is s most committed engaged statement maybe ever even its all around you sounds better once beacons ancestorship reveals it to be just an album and not way sounds from now on of course neither is this record given how restless and hungry they still seem to be but as long as they can keep making albums that possess the fire and verve this one will remain not just pioneers but paragons
levi bruce is another young and promising producer incubated in vancouvers house scene like his peers he makes mellow house music his chime flower fountain cures from last year showed an embryonic sound in the making an album of little beat sketches with the occasional stroke of brilliance w he joins project pablos for his first vinyl release and reclines even further into laid-back bliss the ep opens with where a chord progression unfurls slowly he dots the backdrop with bubbly synths and pitched-down vocals but the brisk beat underneath is all business with only the mere shadow of a beat isnt so direct the wobbly mirage of vocal samples and vapour trails risks formlessness but levis tenacious snares cut a straight line holding it all together both tracks are easy to imagine on a label like mood hut and theyre solid contributions to a local sound thats crystallizing around ambient and new age influences on the eps standout title track hand percussion bobs up and down like its riding a gentle current while a bassline hesitantly feels its way around as birdsong chirps around you is a bit like lying down on the forest floor and taking in the ambience its an immersive piece of sound design thats both captivating and tranquilizing which makes bruces work unique in the vancouver scene his music feels motionless yet is somehow still completely danceable

new signing to a usually classicist label like deep medi is always intriguing and theres something different about just check his recent mix for sonic router which mixes in tyler the creator and more experimental names like djg with predictable dubstep picks like v i v e k an imagination that seems missing from many of his peers and even labelmates it comes through on his debut single where he takes the 140 pm template of dubstep and makes it throb with tribal intensity think ncient memories or ury da woy but polished to a shine rather than the millennial rust of those digital mystikz tunes on he forgoes the temptation to structure tracks around the almighty bass drop and instead crafts a pulsating viber where it feels like hes piling up more drum sounds than the track can actually hold the darker flipside isnt as percussive but it still feels like hes throwing in extra snares and hats in the tiny spaces between the beats this is detail-oriented dubstep: these tunes dont really have any surprises but they dont need to really if youre not enthralled by the sheer massive physicality youll be engaged by the fascinating intricacies
when border community pared back its roster last year and both made the cut its easy to see why as with luke abbott and label boss james holden each approaches techno from his own singular angle while sharing an ear for melody and a taste for the cosmic it seems border communitys couldnt quite contain these two however the debut release on the pairs new label finds both on extremely fine form turning familiar tools to refreshing new ends the a side is s first transmission since 2012s steam days ditches the strong melodic focus of that album in favour of rhythmic torque its swung almost (but not quite) to the point of dysfunction its snares and claps flying every which way the outcome is infectious but rather lightweight its over just as you think its digging in for the long haul never fear: pads things out with an epically tearful beatless coda on the b side the lesser known offers something more substantial is a marked improvement on this years attractive but rather clean cut total order of being ep the groove is loose and mossy the customary kosmische arps have a retrofuturistic tang to them and the whole thing is riddled with weird fx jarring claps rills of delay erratic puffs of white noise smoke of course doesnt let these obstacles stop him from reaching towering emotional heights euphoria in adversity feels all the better earned
after some very impressive releases over the past few years tim healey aka is fairly on the ball when it comes to production with let s rock doing big things in japan on solistice music early 2002 and your lovin in 2001 on ar which featured a 16b remix and inclusion on john digweed s gu:019 there is definitely much more to come from this relatively well known producer s latest project on automatic recordings is and features two version of musical goodness side a (original mix) a slight intro begins and warms you up for the great vocal sample by a new jersey based gangster which takes the lines of you didn t go to hell you went to purgatory my friend and is used initially to break you into to this great sample is used once more later in the track in conjunction with a fairly massive breakdown point the bass-line is coupled with some very drawn out horns and bongo beats that are guaranteed to get asses out of seats the beats grow in a deep funky kind of way until a crazy stretched out synth takes over and eventually leads you to the massive breakdown and then back to the full force of the original mix of side b (metta jt love s remix) on the flip is the metta jt love s take on tim s and initially you will be handed a much rougher deeper bass-line it has a very phat electronic feel and is a very minimal yet powerful abstract version of the original although this mix lacks most of the major components that make up the original it is a great release and its huge simple electronic sounds will surely been making their way to club sets around the world as the second side of this release comes to an end you will find your feet tapping away and really want to get your hands on more both of these mixes are great and are completely different in the way they would be utilised in a club set but keep your ear out for as it will definitely be interesting to see where it gets picked up in the next few months

havent released an artistically resonant album in a very long while since the low-key efforts of 1997s ultra it seems the band have been content capitalizing on their few self-defining signifiers instead of trying to explore uncharted territories in other words their relevance in the pop realm these days is questionable at best yet compared to other bands who had their start in the early 80s post-punk free-for-all and are still active today (think u2 or cure) it seems their influence is everywhere right now artists like footprintz cold cave fairmont and matthew dear all bear the imprint of the synth pop mammoths its fair to say the long-time fans will find solace in the fact that the bands 13th album is their most accomplished and most daring offer since the mark ll-produced exciter setting aside the lukewarm first single the albums introductory salvo ( and ) is striking especially in how crisp the drums sound: for the first time since they started collaborating with him on playing n hilliers indier-than-thou production seems to leave room for long-time collaborator flood on the mixing board and the latters electronic sensibility is showing all over on and they combine the gloomy electronic minimalism of a frame with david gahans i-was-dead-for-two-minutes gravitas isnt perfect for one gahan still has that annoying tendency he developed on their last two albums to let his syllables linger longer than necessary thus accentuating the blues-y vibe the band have been flirting with since personal jesus but considering the odds it shows an animated and still vigorous trio worthy of its semi-legendary status on the bonus cut they take adult s astringent stabs and mix it with an ethereal finale worthy of m83s most contemplative moments daring to show their heirs how spunky synth-pop is done and reminding themselves in the process
while artist after artist in dance music has reanimated vintage club sounds in last few years a small band of likeminded noisemakers have taken a different approach to summoning a bygone era where 707s and 303s waddle around zombie-like in new music bin artists like ekoplekz demdike stare and ndy stott make a tantalizingly new racket thats possessed by some vague and creepy past into s ance now steps ano r radiophonically-addled briton looking to lower temperature of your parlor a solid 0 degrees credited to an anonymous head technician (though if youve ever bought anything from pc s bandcamp page paypal has likely outed ghost box-related culprit for you) output of this transcription service captured on three black mill tapes issued over same number of years conjures a similarly eerie aura from tape hiss and analog groan yet isnt merely next ekoplekz or worse a sign that audio-spiritualism is running on empty though fans of any of above are likely to open ir hearts (or better yet third eyes) to pc ir music reaches this world through a portal all its own types new compilation of first two black mill tapes spread across four visceral sides takes head technicians singular aes tic out of shadows the black mill tapes volumes does plenty to show off pc s analog warmth but where this music truly departs from that of its peers is in its compositional approachability: ambient washes and sinewaves abound but head technician has an apparent knack for beats and melodies that stick with you pairing his obvious early electronic music obsession with a fondness for sleaze of decade or three that came after tracks like and slinky head-nodders with basslines stretching toward sunrise wouldnt sound entirely out of place on beats in space and two late-collection highlights even out- ir ir with lovingly cheesed-up synth melodies and makeout-friendly tempos but even if its not as self-serious or scary as its more famous brethren net effect is chilly: oscillators attempt underhanded hypnosis on : a vortex of ghosts whooshes out from and all that stands between you and doom on is a too-thin layer of static still only real warning that should accompany a release is that its profoundly addictive a creaky cabin in woods youll want to become a permanent resident of
s second contribution to kompakts speicher series arrives almost two years after his first during that time the miami based producer started his own label omnidisc where hes focused on his love for tough detroit inspired dance music the title track from this years miami ep doubled down on the rugged electro sounds and techno structures had teased on records like silicon and four tapping into music that ryan keeling said could actually pass for gesloten cirkel you could potentially say the same of the concussive kicks and robo voices that pepper though it otherwise sounds unlike either artist the techy 125 pm sway of and s patient arp manipulations suit kompakts discography but downplay the imposing energy and undeniable basslines that have always marked s best work ack in 2014 speicher 80 s two tracks made solid use of rapidfire acid sequences warm melodic touches and a low key sense of funk; 91 on the other hand focuses on vaguely trippy fx and slow creeping climaxes that never deliver compared to highlights like miami and chain reaker these two sound bloodless delivering rhythms with a mechanical rigidness that feels unnatural in a catalog colored with buoyancy and sinister groove
berlin-based londoner has always been an in-betweener with colourful modern garage and straight-up house music flirtations on both on hotflush and apollo this debut on leans more towards the 4/4 side of things than usual for dixon sacrifices the heavily emotive content of his previous work in favour of lean grooves unfortunately his attempts to dress up these skeletons still leaves a whole lot of bone showing with its rumbling bassline and pitched-down vocals could almost soundtrack a circo loco night it has that same muggy atmosphere that here manages to numb even his trademark synth layering notching up the anesthetic another hit ps honestly doesnt do much of anything twiddling its thumbs for eight minutes the writhing ups the ante even further; with butch-style drum hits and vocal snippets its an unexpected pastiche of late-period minimal only lives up to his past work juggling a vocal sample that successfully combines the wan infrastructure with something resembling vibrancy its certainly not his best work but it shows that even amidst a misstep he still has his own flair buried in there somewhere
norways cult sex tags mania crew have recently been collaborating with a similar scene of diy ish new rk producers label boss dj sotofett performed alongside the likes of and l i e s svengalisghost in the city last month and the former receives a sotofett dub on this very tri state area sounding 12 inch s far as this writer can tell s do hasnt been released before but its original incarnation probably sounded a lot different from sotofetts straightforward mix the track takes a page from the legendary club zanzibar as its underlined by a boisterously punchy garage shuffle there are hints of s signature creep in its glassy synthetics but unlike the impressionistic remixes on the recent recast ep do shows his sound completely overhauled for the dance floor the flip contributed by the hitherto unknown delights ce sotto is the kind of sleeper hit the label has made its name on a near perfect groove for which a stock list of elements seems pointless other than the trespassers style thudding kick and the murmuring line let go girl / uve got to play it smart its an instance of how far subtle simplicity can go and its bleary self contained hypnosis warrants more attention than the records limited pressing will grant it
if youve heard scubas dj-kicks youll no doubt recognise a highlight of this ridiculously fine debut ep its a pile-driving berghain-esque twist on bass music with a distinctly live feel by his own admission its author tim van de muetter k jumps from dance genre to dance genre not to show off his prodigious versatility but merely because he gets a bit bored never has attention deficiency been so welcome in contrast to the fist-pumping aural assault of shows up trace elements of the dubstep that weaned himself on simple spattering percussion and glowing pads eventually open up to a squiggly driving acid bassline and old school detroit analogue keys in contrast (youll use contrast a lot when critiquing van de muetters work) locks into a classic house groove laying on top a mutilated vocal sample and a rotorblade rhythm the breadth of ideas on show here and their expert execution leads you to the conclusion that heres a young man that threatens to be a bit special
in a review of his debut ep for angus finlayson said that miles mitchell aka mr mitch transcended the grime scene the same way that vexd and pinch did with dubstep on the same label in the 00s s an apt comparison at least in theory: throughout his debut album mitchell slows grime to a crawl and replaces its frenzied attack with the steady repetition of just a few elements s a promising formula but pulling it off requires rock solid composition something mitchell doesnt always have a firm hold of in its best moments has a lovely lullaby-ish sweetness we dont typically associate with london grime is wonderfully wispy with quiet synths that dissipate into a powdery reverb chamber crawls along with just enough melody to keep your attention as if it were meant to merely tease res an endearing music-box quality to and mitchells rework of s is one of the prettiest tunes to come out of the boxed camp though that one also features periodic vocal gasps a device that becomes a problem elsewhere on the album sampling little snippets of r b can add a lot to a giddy rhythm but on they crack the gorgeous facade of tracks like dont and to the point of distraction in a way it feels like mitchell is tip-toeing all the through dont ask and have all the elements of slamming grime tunes but spaced out to a slow-faucet drip this is interesting in its own way but as goes on it begins to feel like mitchell hasnt done much to his formula aside from slowing it down hes an excellent producer with an unusual ear for melody so its a nice effect at first but for something as weighty as a debut album from a hotly-tipped artist feels a little too light for its own good

you know how when youre a kid everything is absolutes modern dance music is kinda still stuck re flipping between night-and-day of dour seriousness vs punch-your-mom-in- -face party ethic it makes it hard to find music that does more than soundtrack individual emotions somewhere between juan macleans raucous four-on- -floor formula and chamber vox techno of likes of imogen heap or bat for lashes re lies a fabled land called subtlety most time only brian eno lives re but for goddamn once in our lives a new guy nee pascal arbez hits it more than hits it owns it s debut full-length ok cowboy made waves back in 2005 with its woozy blend of smarter-than-average synths and weirder-than-average samples but re was this one track the past that came on like an adderall-powered freight train loaded with paperback copies of steppenwolf (thats a metaphor for being rad and subtle at same time ) and it left you being all why cant he make a whole record like that wish granted our boy arbez is back and hes got a danceable enola gay filled with subtlety bombs eponymous cut feels like bastard child of justice and lindstrom detuned and headfucked but not too far gone to exude shy thoughtfulness single grabs a creepo crystal castles-style child vocal and forces it to smash through pane after pane of 8-bit glass the cartwheeling bassline draws a stealth jet contrail across background again achieving near impossible feat of being silly while staying somber danceable but dingy likewise slowburner is as implacable as its le samoura namesake playing quiet razorgrooves close to vest giving it up without giving it away basically i could rave retardedly about great dance like this until i have a nanotech beard but why bo r get this record and spin it til youre tired of it n go listen to some berlin-era bowie or early roxy music or something then put on again and realize multi-layered paradoxical pop doesnt come around that much anymore
the 23 year-old out of the united kingdom takes a stab at his first solo release with the under and learns his niche while finding that taking ideas of the past can be a very inspirational new truth is a bit funky a bit bumpy yet smooth like a coat of rich ice cream a lovely piece to open the ep as the lo-fi fidelity captures the ear immediately it s cool while achieving its goal of being a dance-friendly track and still being an interesting piece of music for the stereo polished drum beats overlapping the live instruments gives new truth the added punch to showcase why the label believes in the young producer keep quiet overall approach works better than new truth though it s not on par as the opener a livelier percussion and a slight hint of melody in the air there certainly is a groove that s building strangely enough the productions on keep quiet sounds better than new truth but you really can t go wrong with either one until you hear the last track last but not least is your future a crazy little bug that glitches it s way around your head and heart very loungey and dancey all at the same time you d wonder with all its jazz elements and influences why there isn t a jazz remix building from the tempo of new truth and keep quiet this will add another reason why you ll pay attention to the ep and the young from here on out
comparing a dubstep release to the intricately tailored and impeccably planned dance routines of torvil and dean one of skatings most indelible and unsurpassable pairings may seem a little strange to include in your press release ut for 23hz numaestro it makes sense: its almost impossible not to recognise similarities in the way that each track on the sixth release from the reading-based spins and evolves when the thick low end bass lines bound and pirouette around the mix you cant help but be mystified and locked in an awe-powered trance the likes of which millions of olympic viewers must have experienced that magical day in sarajevo back in 84 when the two ice skating supremos were awarded 12 perfect 6 0s drives its punching snares into carefully cut shards of female vocals and a heady mixture of square wave stabs and deep sub bass dding subtle touches as it goes along it unfurls with phasers and flangers colouring the pockets of hi-hats thus altering the groove enough to keep the momentum feeling loose and away from the malignant rigidity of a 2-step beat is the one though and its a mover pure and simple there are echoic vocal slices that make the higher frequencies bubble and pop into life with a flavour not a million miles from the work of pangaea and his hessle udio label mates the rough and ready crunch of the rhythm spurs the mix at you but the descending bass line that wraps and taps on your chest in unison is undoubtedly the vibe that delivers the knockout punch without the swirl of sine waves it could easily be just another stepper that sets up another in the mix but with it its a focus puller; and an emphatically replay-able one at that
the original version of came out as a split ep in october backed with jimmy appearing under his creepy autograph moniker is a bottom-heavy cut that marries the rolling percussion and chords that have been a detroit hallmark for decades to a more bass-led rhythmically ambitious approach but for his remix heads to the east coast switching from an off-beat bump to something that sits between new jersey grooves and miami bounce the sliced vocal stab is pure ghetto-funk while the organ lick is like some forgotten kerri chandler cut these days thats shorthand for tediously revivalist but s too canny a producer to simply rehash sounds this is dance floor dynamite raucous yet deep anthemic without brashness and proves yet again that s midas touch can turn even tired tropes into gold
s sounds tailor-made for in a way this isnt surprising: lorenz brunner is a chameleonic producer whose sound though consistent has never adhered to any one style for long hes made downcast chicago trips for acid test galloping techno for dystopian and emotive big-room tunes for hotflush all without compromising his essence but on the trappings of the project seem to have swallowed him whole the record sounds like a blockbuster record first and foremost; that its the third album from feels almost incidental the combination of s economical production and big-room emotions makes for something thats well a little too tasteful brunners lines are clean his composition is flawless and you imagine every last frequency achieving maximum impact on nightclub and festival soundsystems such tidy production though sometimes reveals the shallowness of the content the tunes glide along in airy percussive chugs and tonal right-turns buzzy synth chords signal excitement reverb on top signals a lot of excitement and thats about all weve got to work with lead single a track that sounds destined for a sports car commercial is the clearest case in point with an insistently emotional melody that never quite develops beyond a three-note riff its enjoyable in a way how could it not be but i sense brunner holding back bigger ideas in service of making a small one sound as mammoth as possible s best moments come when brunner explores a space far from the festival field the slow brittle tip-toe of could be a high-definition remaster of an on acid b-side and puts s minimalistic streak back in service of subtlety most of the record though is like : stomping beat vaguely mystical melody and not much tying it together its the essence of distilled to its purest form but without the x-factor and musicality that defined tracks like ten walls gotham its a dead end
t the start of the year i mentioned electros recent resurgence and hoped that more artists would go nuts and broaden the genres palate right now is one such artist he doesnt deviate too much from the sounds usual sci-fi moods but the boldness and curiosity of his music stands out on a track on this ep for the new berlin label he cranks the levels up on everything and goes for it s a super-charged 150 bpm-plus cut with screeching effects and an incredible breakdown where you can hear him goofing around with the knobs roughly half of s tracks dont have beats but the wild moods persist is a polyrhythmic mess of synths with crazy delay settings on he creates a smouldering skid mark of sound that could have come from the studio of shapednoise nd even on the short ostensibly softer interludes ( and ) theres a razor-sharpness to s gestures long with is the best of the club tracks early on a gorgeous wash of pads softens the drums attack but by the tracks midpoint all bets are off its the sort of thing a dj like objekt would cunningly deploy at the end of a peak-time set the straighter and arent quite as distinctive but are worth considering if youre digging for more standard electro between this ep and the recent dosing the population has shown that hes currently among electros most inspired producers
if is to escape its zeitgeist and enjoy the same kind of longevity as the genres it makes a living from distilling it will need records like this generally its a style thats prone to the brazen but you wouldnt know that from s the welshmans been dropping hints of subtle flair ever since his track drums in the deep appeared on fabrics elevator music back in january and now with only a handful of remixes and a single ep under his belt seems to have hit an early maturity with s if he made all this with an index finger over pursed lips the arrangement is hushed to the point of pin-drop detection indeed its not the bass or the snares so often the funky calling-card that usher the ebb and flow of the piece but rather an inconspicuous layer of vinyl-crackling its hissing swells introduce new motifs over the ever-ominous string ensemble these include percussive and bass elements but most striking of all is the depth of soul achieved by the two simple words in the title that are chopped into a resonance not normally associated with this more playful of genres
s last album green language was caught between worlds -name vocal collaborations sat uneasily with churchy ambient; shots at the charts with more eccentric moments hes since said that it was too a red and in a recent interview he talked about being pulled in two directions by the people around him his next lp released with minimal press and an iphone photo for a cover aims to set things straight returns to the simplest ingredients of s music from hyperactive second track onwards its a relentless barrage of sugar-rush anthems pitched somewhere between club trap and stadium trance each more intense than the last the melodies are gleeful one-finger things the drums compressed and distorted till they shriek the chipmunked vocal samples whisked into a giddy swirl of emotion at first its pretty invigorating after all this is just the sort of focus that green language lacked but as the carousel of breakdown frantic buildup and vertiginous drop keeps turning it becomes exhausting ltimately s purism exposes the limitations of his style in pursuit of ever bigger gestures hes crushing his music against a ceiling both in terms of literal dynamics compression obliterates any subtlety in these tracks and emotional content demands nothing less than complete euphoria all the time and thats a lot to ask a track like registers as little more than desperate incoherent energy the album rallies in its closing minutes and are jazz-fusion concoctions of buttery leads and paradiddling drums is a lost cue from a hollywood tearjerker these tracks are just as overblown as the others but in different and stranger ways it s telling that they call to mind s first album glass swords back then his maximalism meant an overload of the imagination suggests a narrower definition
while was preparing for her last mix cd 0 5s kicks she dug out some old records from her collection including exos grass hunter from 998 that rediscovery spurred the birth her label a platform for ultra deep sometimes retro techno from a diverse but close knit group artists the time since her kicks s style has become more adventurous informed by the loads new music she has lined up for her label and her continued record digging es created a fearless decade spanning sound which is on full display in mix is made only forthcoming material and old obscure records which makes the old tracks sound new and vice versa s a stunning 80 minutes that shows at the height her powers to surprise confuse and delight best way to describe s style is to say she doesnt give a fuck her mixing is erratic: not all her blends are clean and she jumps between tempos and styles without much regard for continuity highlights these eccentricities one particularly rocky instance she lets s chaotic run out into a beatless intro before rescuing the mix with a stop start track from and some mad idm frenzy from s the kind bizarre moment that could be frustrating but makes it raw and exciting the sign a mix that was made in the heat the moment and not clinically perfected in post production fits a notable tracks into 80 minutes which is on par with scubas herculean fabric 90 but where that mix was intricately stitched together s is rough and ready with a fluctuating pace e lets some tracks ride out and spends less than 5 seconds on others using them as part the mixs unique patchwork sound is about what youd expect: ambient ish techno some idm flavour old school dub techno acid tunes from veterans like and are set against and res killer obscure russian techno ( ) the icelandic electronica that helped inspire s recent transformation ( ) and psychedelic efforts from herself re are stretches dry minimalism and explosions colour (like s quirky ) along with s dreamworld plunderphonics thanks to their oddly hypnotic vocal samples s re and s unsettling int are landmarks in the mix gets across s unique musical world e finds value in old records without making them sound old primarily because how well she matches them with the right new material es always done things her own way and is the latest stubbornly weird milestone on her ascent mixs ending feels emblematic en from phex twins cloud dump last year fork rave is bright and frenetic and like the rest its old new and never boring

jamal moss presents another debut for his mathematics label this time from who constructs three meditative deep house cuts from deceptively simple materials is the main attraction a ten-minute slow-burner built around a lush arpeggiating riff and a busy oddly plastic bassline dditional layers a halftime clap snatches of vocal and guitar periodic barrages of snare drum are carefully added to create a texture of challenging density an indistinct haze of detail that makes for hypnotic listening at home but would probably struggle to make impact on the dance floor elsewhere s sound palette is defined similarly by a mild claustrophobia and an unusual mix of flatly synthetic elements and raw looped samples opens with a gorgeous splashy vibraphone loop and another spiralling bassline before detailed hi-hat patterns surface tugging gently at the seams of the pulse when the kick drum enters its a paltry thing something of an anticlimax but still we build up a good head of steam before close finally the title track is the most sun-kissed of the lot but also the least convincing not because of its mellifluous chords and light-fingered bassline which slip down nicely but due to its structure its a stop-start affair that lacks the smooth forward-motion found elsewhere

2nd opinion next up on the always consistent is a release from s beyond your soul is first up and it is a great track simply put nice clattering beats meet a very good driving baseline that combines quite well with a catchy vocal hook the arrangement is very solid keeping the track interesting throughout the broken beats come out with echo with the track flowing quite purposely in the first few minutes it s raw and quite gritty until it meets a long breakdown full of smooth deep strings that lead the beats back in with melodies attached not a bad little prog breaks track at all i must say i quite like this release more so due to the very solid a-side
kick back into gear with the the third instalment of the ep series by stefano miele returns with 3 more tracks all with a noticeable funk element already with support from the likes of plump dj s stanton warriors rennie pilgrem meat katie and tayo just to name a few it is quite easy to see why the big names in are behind this release on the a-side is hypnoticfunk and it builds with some nice crisp drum patterns and a very delicious baseline that rumbles below the surface nice funky synth patterns roll in the foreground while the beats flow seamlessly the funky elements soon build to a high deep in the track all while the beats and brilliant base tones flow nicely a great production by funk909 is first up on the b-side and it is another smooth production by the beats flow nicely while the piano line rolls nicely in the foreground giving the track a somewhat retro feel smooth atmospheric breakdowns don t do any harm in this nice warm production following this is plasticfunk a track seeing heavy support from the plumps quite quirky from the outset with cut up vocal effects the track sees a nice heavy baseline come into the play while acid riffs twist and turn giving the track quite a unique feel definitely the most driving production from the lot this one is bound to tear a few floors up another quality set of works by the italian break maestro with 3 pretty contrasting but overall quality productions on the ever growing label
there are three things at play on s ep: soul vitality and a certain melodic recklessness which is almost definitely responsible for the previous two the turkish producers last release was a finger-clicking jazzy affair on cadenza and while the present mood is more of a blue funk a canorous freedom remains it manifests itself in a folk-tech jig at once doleful and lively; an off-kilter guitar nocturne and two complimentary pieces of percussion-free in his words synthscaping discordance is normally revealing of gaps in a producers understanding of theory but although the synth play at the end of does feel lazily haphazard (theres a difference between playing freely along a scale and hitting the wrong notes) for the most part fidan exacts a congenial melancholy from a slightly recalibrated chord here or a nudged cue there similarly the sensitive velocity of the acoustic guitar line evinces a logic preset played with heavy thumbs but instead of sounding inauthentic it gives a haunted tune its ghost and are both cinematic in scope and lush in sound fidan summons his inner vangelis colliding laser-beam sequences into shapeshifting chords for an ambience of sepia-tinted science-fiction this beat-free environment works for him but its within the tech-house frame of that the most thrilling results emerge mercurial piece of vocal work propelled by an electric fiddle and a beat that feels played it signals a level of creativity in a form thats apparently much more than rhythm and bass
a couple of months back released a record that came to its attention through a chance find at a paris flea mark the music on paki visnadis imaginary choreography cass te was then issued on vinyl for the first time 31 years after it was produced the labels latest release a by has a swe fa d quality that sounds like it too was rescued from a forgotten pile of secondhand tapes as it turns out a is a compl ely new release and unlike imaginary choreography it comes with no context or backstory little is known about dumont except that he lives in tvia the two opening tracks a and lesprit lescalier s slinky french vocals against a dubby backdrop of synths and steel drums both are lovely and it wouldve been un rstandable if dumont ma a whole record in this vein but the vocals disappear for good on et s an energ ic afro-house tune reminiscent of fellow act albinos a s b-si slopes away from the dance floor and towards som hing more horizontal this is music for hammocks or sun lounges theres some of jon hassells fourth world concept in yusef whose buttery percussion and str ched-out guitar transports you to an imagined tropical paradise takes a conventional dub rhythm and pr ty melody smothering it in tape hiss; ch teau closes the lp with som hing yland kirby might produce if he took the car aker to the caribbean dreamy keys float by while the looping needle stuck in a runout groove sounds like waves lapping at a shore whats most impressive about a is how much ground it covers in so little time sliding by in a breezy 25 minutes its brevity is central to its appeal: a teases and begui like the final slither of a s ting sun
gilles aikens long-standing association with the recently shuttered white label might be over but hes still at home on giegling and oliver hafenbauers aiken is among a cluster of german artists with ties to labels like dial live at robert johnson and lackrec whose contributions to have helped cultivate the labels playfully aloof aura aikens last record featured evocative reimaginations of harmonia and brian eno aikens third release on comes with a solemn visual reminder of john hurts recent passing and sees aiken explore different ways to unsettle a dance floor fans of aikens 2014 album for giegling will probably enjoy the title track another experiment in rewiring krautrock for the 21st century the interplay between the percussion and the oscillating modulations offers the first glimpse of unease it feels like aiken is evading an alien force while shuffling minimalist percussion gives djs something to grasp the thrilling new beat tool feels made to slam into the mix but the nervous energy remains the strident drums will sound satisfying when smacking off the walls of a nightclub but the other squelching elements might have you glancing over your shoulder is the eps murkiest track among aikens oddest productions it sounds like a diwali riddim edit from demdike stare and feels right at home on
fter a brief flirtation with sci+tec udio for their inside/outside ep earlier this year k timo maas and santos are back with connaisseur and seemingly the pair have found their niche within a niche; toilet tracks a reference to the length of their recent productions rather than the quality of them the maas renaissance is now unquestioned ut until about six months ago the last time i really paid much attention to the craggy-faced dutchman was pre- music for the maases when he was all pent-up aggression and industrial clanging things have got a lot cleaner and smoother lately and much of this olay effect can be attributed to his recent siamese-like partnership with santos who has always had an uncanny knack for effectively placing a lovely whooshy pad here and a soaring string there is by far the stronger of the pair here and while not quite flawless is certainly a coherent lesson in the art of the slow burn dubby bass and kicks underpin a skittering line of percussion while the twisted hook proves that while working with santos may have relaxed maas just a little the outright hostility of his earlier work has merely morphed into something more closely resembling quiet menace the break is big and beautiful and would be the appropriate soundtrack to the birth of a new star or something equally hyperbolic but the real beauty of this track is that it doesnt feel like a fraction of its 12-minute length is decent enough and at over ten minutes isnt exactly succinct but doesnt have the big tune appeal that so effortlessly oozes with a simple bassline and solid snare and percussion arrangement its aiming for a cobblestone jazz-esque groove and comes very close to pulling it off but not quite stick to the big ones boys

listening to in youre likely to be struck by a particular thought: its crazy how similar this stuff sounds today more than perhaps any other style of music dub techno has held on to its original palette in this case one designed nearly 20 years ago by mark ernestus and moritz von oswald visionary producers responsible for the unlikely marriage of techno and dub reggae its striking to hear a genres blueprints laid out so clearly and this inevitably adds authority to these records today but thats only part of what makes reissues like worthwhile as many of s fans will tell you the duos music has done more than stand the test of time its remained the best of its kind features three tracks that originally appeared on s 1995 compilation bcd with the title track appearing for the first time in its full length (13 minutes and 54 seconds nearly triple the original cut) this one like most music by and its various offshoots is an exercise in classic minimalism a short but deceptively complex pattern repeats ad infinitum throbbing bassline quivering chords lots of complicated panning as it plays nothing changes but the richness of its composition comes into focus its less a thing that happens and more a place you inhabit a cold grey underwater place but one thats also soothing in its own way the other two tracks are even more austere q1 2 is little more than two chords shimmering like a mirage and melting into one another eventually joined by an almost imperceptible bass pulse is more sound art than music a thin gauze of hissing fuzz shot through with piercing high frequencies sparing as they are both are easy to lose yourself in which points to s genius: by rejecting any and all possible embellishment they made music that was timeless and incredibly immersive
re are countless people unhappy with the meaning that has became attached to minimal in the past few years not least who recently shut down his label in an effort to distance himself from a genre that he never embodied anyway but when costello found himself with the sort of dance tracks that didnt quite fit on his new imprint look long i imagine he gritted his teeth a little bit and squeezed out what might just be the last release for the label maybe if it doesnt happen again (well see ) result is among costellos finest work in the dance arena: reflects the producers infatuation with the titular piece of gear its aquatic melody wavers softly up and down creating a sense of queasy calm via repetition buoyed by a 4/4 stomp and the tiniest offbeat my pick of the two though is of the because i like a good cry every now and then (who doesnt ) costellos rolls the beat rougher but his melody is even sweeter a melancholic dirge that rivals anything found on his early ambient albums it might not be the optimal soundtrack for tom cruise biting into kirsten dunsts neck but wesley snipes sure
ive always thought of as a man for clubs a man to deliver big tune for big sound system indeed i had little idea that babicz had released two lps on each side of turn of millennium both of which were experimental and far from personal clubbing highlights like my car and sin as such i came to his newest album with both hope and trepidation has my excitement levels remained after immersing myself in only partly so perhaps predictably i think many people will find highlights of this album in club-orientated tracks the fever mix of dark flower and in particular immediately grab you from first listen theyve got catchy melodies and big bouncy basslines in spades whats more res nothing formulaic about m dark flower s bassline mutates three times throughout its length with each mutation signaling a rise in energy level and giving extra impetus to its multiple breakdowns its a clever arrangement that will tickle ears when listening at home but also send a crowd into rapture in club something i recently witnessed firsthand all of non-ambient tracks are solid full of energy and melody its when babicz tones things down that weaknesses of emerge although its clearly not case it sounds as though babicz felt almost obliged to include se productions into album for sake of diversity there are some moments of loveliness: both tblisi and emotive tblisi linger in mind and of adds a bit of funk to album but productions such as and are missing babicz spark that radiates elsewhere theres nothing particularly catchy or clever in se instances it might be harsh to call se tracks filler but its hard not to feel that way when quality surrounding it is so high never less se lacklustre moments are overshadowed on by surrounding goodness consider album like you would a degustation meal with chef babicz more often than not producing plates that hit spot
: the name just evokes visions of resorts towns and decadent discotheques doesnt it the second release from the uk label doesnt disappoint in that regard offering four heavily melodic uk house tracks made of silky surfaces and clever hooks the first turn comes from london newcomer whose bubbly house number is propelled upwards by perky chords and compressed synth noises what and lacks in originality it makes up for in pure professionalism delighting in the slickness of its own textures fellow newbie juno tightens up the track a smidge but his surgical alterations go a long way flattened out into the new jacking groove and gains some much needed weight that edges it just slightly over the original steps up with a 110 bpm slow flame called using the same gloss is more aesthetic as his track inserts some melancholia into the well plumbed depths of synth nostalgia as it trudges along (forget miami vice the electric piano hits in are straight from the law and order theme) step in for the final and best track with the uk funky inspired pairing indefatigably bouncy percussion with punchy horn stabs and gasping vocls finding a nice medium between s maximalism and s slow hand

playa den bossas club is celebrated as one of ibizas most acclaimed day- and nightspots thanks in part to its mixture of south beach chic (beachside location canopied day beds a sushi bar) and white isle hedonism now it joins the ranks of iconic clubs like studio 54 and berghain earning its own recorded homage courtesy of frankfurt duo by my count theirs is actually at least the fourth ode to this year but they win points for comprehensiveness dividing their portrait into day and night versions is the more satisfying of the pair albeit for reasons hard to pinpoint; the central chord change translates a kind of blissful ambivalence rising and falling against a simple contrapuntal bassline in a way that mirrors your own mood coming off either upbeat or downcast depending upon the circumstances the rhythm lightly stomping and shaker heavy is simple but effective lying back and staying out of the way of restrained synthesizer modulations its a clean focused track that knows exactly where its going and never overreaches follows a similar pattern but it somehow fails to make the same impact even though its (marginally) the tougher of the two tracks with sharper metallic percussion and glassy 16th-note pings maybe its the monotone structure with a single dogged bassline and a single unchanging augmented chord the texture of that chord at least is delicious with a fluctuating tremolo that brings it to life deetrons remix its unclear whether its of one of the versions or a composite of parts of both stays true to s aesthetic with surging chords and no-frills drum programming but it pushes the adrenaline level twice as far the groove is tougher full of rattling snares and white-hot cymbals and the bassline is almost anthemic in its proportions closer in spirit to london than the continent tightly looped chord samples and suggestive hints of human voice only serve to push things over the top the most urgent of the three tracks here it makes a fitting complement to s laid-back originals counterbalancing their chilled composure with an end-of-night all-out spirit whether deetrons interpretation reflects s evolving spirit we wont know until next summer when a luxury hotel opens on the site
its often easy to hear what a producer has brought to table in a duo setting trio though what can be said for sure is that giorgio gigli obtane and n x_acid have plenty of love for deeper strain of techno that has been so popular of late on labels like prologue and found its footing with romes elettronica romana in early 00s oth obtane and giorgio giglis zooloft and n xs conito do too embracing hypnotic qualities of a 4/4 beat that punches you in brain ra r than face on this collaborative release between two imprints trio mine same territory with some very subtle differences: biggest point of departure comes on which has a bite to it that this sort of techno often lacks metallic pinging may not seem like much but it sets track out as a busier and more frenetic tune than many contemporary releases of this ilk on and however major appeal is in how it seamlessly rolls out its fascinating too because close listens reveal that stuff that y push up against se velvet soft beats is absolutely avant-garde musique concrete that wouldnt be out of place in a pierre schaeffer composition
call me ignorant but its hard to tell exactly what has dachsund and john remixing here ( nd ripperton and gn s on + 91 head 2 for that matter ) is it various sessions for the track head or is it the material found on + 91 head 1 named in a confusing way to keep us off the trail whatever the case both packages of + 91 head thus far have been solid bits of functional house and this edition is no different dachsunds session is dubby house that puts its cymbal high in the mix and rides out a groove in unassuming fashion trumpets float in a jamaican vocal is sampled the sound design is impeccable it doesnt do anything special and it isnt particularly great but it gets the job done without much fuss nd sometimes theres something to be said for that fuss however should be made of john s version which is simultaneously chunky and lithe dub house that concentrates far more on the house part than its predecessor it starts off innocently enough with the same sort of chords youve heard hundreds of times before but at some point decided to make this thing special adding a melancholic harmony that plays against the established mood beautifully it transforms what could have easily been an anonymous remix of s mysterious source material into something special indeed

san franciscos deep house house scene is flourishing with some classy releases from chris lum jay-j the om records posse and now this release by dj rasoul with tracks coming from artists such as natural rhythm solar house ny house heroes mateo matos and rasoul himself rasoul takes the listener on a journey through a current snapshot of music releases and their interpretation of the deep house scene the cd does get slightly monotonous with the same elements being used continually throughout the whole cd - 4 to the floor beat latin percussion funk stabs thrown in occasionally and a few build ups female vocals are thrown in to break the monotony of the release some selections thrown into the mix are as old as 1997 and 5 years on the style and quality of the releases has not changed one bit the listener could easily be forgiven for thinking that they are listening to one track throughout the duration of this cd if funky deep house is your personal preference then this is for you however for those out there who prefer a little variety in their mix cd selections save your money
res nothing new to be found in new ep for whereas his remix for coldfish and 2-inch for mirau last year were otherworldly things that seemed to exist just a bit outside of anything that was happening in dance music the berlin-based producer seems to be slowly regressing to the mean its not a bad thing: res great pleasure to be had in ro reuth s old-school chord progression the s similarly bouncy bass-driven melody or s constantly upbuilding theme and clumpy climax unlike previous work though way back home seems content to rest in the realm of purely functional re are no breakdowns that last just a bit too long or sounds that seem comically out of sync with the rest of the track rough edges have been sanded off proper production techniques have been acquired and now were merely left with three songs that are merely pretty darn good instead of transcendent needless to say consistency is a trait worth chasing fter all a darn good ep is better than a mediocre one but when consistency becomes the watchword innovation starts to become that much further away
have had their fingers in all flavours of pies in the past few years but it seemed like the duo moved from lovably kooky oddballs to scene-spanning stalwarts pretty much overnight their modeselektion compilation showcased a wide-ranging taste pulling exclusive tracks from what felt like every prominent dance music producer on both the bass and techno sides of the divide and you can hear how it has seeped into their productions right from the beginning on their third album their first on their own label instead of bpitch control when coasts to life on hollow drums that sound more like the distinct techno of cosmin trg than anything on last album happy birthday with gorgeous meanders into skyward-gazing synth territory its very typically so many things at once but really as a whole is so many things at once too instead of sprawl it feels like gernot bronsert and sebastian szary are more deadly accurate than theyve ever been jumping from idea to idea and nailing nearly everything they try harsher electro-tinged tracks like and recall their earlier work but then theyre doing the best night slugs-style tracks this side of uh night slugs with quirky and smooth instrumentals like or the bleepy no matter what contemporaries they might be aping the duo rarely sound like anything but themselves is dressing up contemporary ideas in their own defiantly angular outfits and its usually more thrilling than the people they might be gleaning inspiration from in the first place the album is heavy on the vocal tracks but the duo pick their vocalists carefully and cater to them equally cautiously radioheads makes a return appearance here on two tracks but unlike the idm-ish white flash from the last time around it feels like the two are going out of their way to make songs that actually sound like s band as a result is possibly the best radiohead track since reckoner all spidery guitars and scattered rhythms ps make a dramatic appearance on green light emotes all over and is in turn torn and twisted the duos slap-happy antics and canadian rapper s harsh cadence is unnaturally stretched over a glitching bulldozer of a beat these are prominent guest spots and sure to garner some extra attention outside of whatever underground dance circuit might already embrace them; but the duo dont rely on namepower and the fact that the singer of one of the worlds most famous rock bands is all over two of these tracks feels more like status quo than any kind of special event the same goes for itself bronsert and szary rarely break the mould here but its instead one of the most accessible and effortlessly enjoyable dance music albums of the year
israel s guy gerber returns for a second outing on cocoon after this is balagan this time joining forces with newbie and fellow israeli shlomi aber recently gerber has been touted as the saviour of the middleground between prog and techno his stoppage time handraiser was a big hit on both sides of the divide towards the tail end of 05 with props from the likes of both wink and sasha but the question is how does someone who put out on bedrock makes the leap over to cocoon has sven chosen his wunderkinden wisely casts off with droning bass and crackle-pop percussives adding mystique with arpeggiated synth-organs that help conjure up a lost-in-a-desert feeling hmmm bubbly prog-techno this is slightly intriguing yet simultaneously vague but it is different and quite possibly very suitable warm-up gear for your early evening set if by now youve managed not to fall asleep in your sand-pit after love is attempts an alternative but this tastes of bedrocky salt with the cringe factor set to high: it s really just drifty meandering prog with not the slightest traceable element of techno a track that promises so much but in the end fails to deliver and i am not feeling this one at all a dubious effort then from the one time macabi tel-aviv footballer who doesn t quite bring a touch of the middle east to germany one can forgive sven for wanting to relive his trance days through gerber and cocoon has always had that sense of magic and conjuration so i can see the allure of signing this one hypnotic or yawn-inducing its a far cry from stoppage time for gerber though who provides more bazaar than oasis in a sea of sand
for those who only know martin landsky via his hit-and-miss tech house for poker flat recordings this reissue of two tracks from his days as the boss of effortil/intim may come as a shock landsky sounds about as funky as a white man can get cutting up records on both sides like a dance floor-beholden moodymann oth and were put out in the late 90s a moment when landsky hadnt quite mellowed into elder statesman status nd both are rough rude and unlike much of his work since genuinely exciting while the man may have become better at production theres something absolutely visceral about s repeated exhortation keep it funky indeed the release makes its way back onto wax via the folks at decks this being the third 12-inch in their new reissue label with lake axters our luv miss kittin the hackers 1982 and romanthonys the wanderer all now in the hands of many vinyl lovers for the first time and moodymanns dem young sconies and romanthonys let me show you love apparently on the way its hard to dispute the company that decks has placed landskys two tracks in listening to the results i cant help but agree
and had their breakthrough in 2012 when instrumental grime was making its comeback ercy deserved its place at the table but its reboot of classic eight bar grime was on the trad side compared to some of the wilder ideas floating around this is how the bristol duo likes it ir bandulu label is vinyl only in homage to the scenes early days and their gorgon project does to rootsy dub what ercy did to grime s theyre in a pocket of producers among them deep medis and who innovate while invoking the uk bass styles of a decade ago ir best tracks sound fresh but the flavours are familiar this tension between tradition and innovation can be heard in the duos fabriclive mix aving sourced 14 unreleased exclusives from bandulu the echo crew and friends couldnt be accused of being stuck in the past but the mixs menacing moods measured halftime beats and sturdy basslines feel in thrall to a classic formula ometimes the duo make these materials sound fresh and sometimes they dont opening section is the most interesting sombre dub echoes of o vmv m give way to a collision of eekersinternationals samples and s bedroom pop s is odd ersatz u rap and we hear at his strangest on two unreleased productions se tracks pull outside influences into s sombre universe making its boundaries seem permeable gs change as the mix plateaus around 140 b m re are still standouts: s spot on the produced ghest say or a collab whose bassline toggles between foghorn and gatling gun s which features is a particular highlight and one of the mixs few older tracks but these moments become rarer and a string of similar subwoofer rattling bass pulses whip crack snares and judiciously placed sirens cause fatigue to set in surprises dont return until the mixs closing minutes detours into softer moods thanks to s ungry and s then lurches back into gear with a remix of ir pyros raucous that track evaporates into the spectral dub clouds of s s one of the mixs oldest tracks and one of the most futuristic sounding

was never going to be just a uk sound even us aussies are prone to making some awesome breaks tracks check out nubreed and infusion who are both flying the aussie flag all around the globe hailing from sweden pulls out a new release for and doing a very good job of it as well side a underground this side is one for the floor - hard party rockin beats with that tough aggressive attitude think big groovy fucker but a lot more aggressive the male vocals thrown in are possibly there to shine some light in an otherwise dark environment best used during at the climax of a set side b barmaid from stockholm the b-side is a more uplifting tune starting off with some rolling breaks and electro vocoder sample unfortunately once the synthesiser kicks in with some mellow overtones the track feels a little spaced out and psychedelic ( wow i m tripping man yeah ) however all is not lost peo cuts up some magic with the breaks in the middle probably to stop people s attention from wavering once the end nears all the mellow synth samples are lost and we re left with a wicked ass break beat he really should ve left it that way give me two copies and i ll be happy playing the breaks at the end
say what you want about timo maas: the man has an eye for talent sure that means he often puts his name on the work of (presumably) other peoples work but as long as theyre getting paid and noticed by the people who care about such things whats the harm besides one listen to maas recent subtellite for cocoon or this monster for the humorously titled rockets ponies imprint and youre likely to be shouting for joy not for the discogs info for those who do care about such things italian producer sante pucello k santos is behind the current maas renaissance collaborating with the producer to build massive tracks in both length and format trumps the 12-and-a-half minute subtellite by more than four minutes and earns every second of its runtime starting off like an ennio morricone soundtrack all yawning strings and moody toms before quickly launching into a slow-motion shimmery techno build that lasts for just about the entire length of the track like selway and smiths equally-as-massive total departure its the type of tune that seems to hardly need a dj to do much more than sit behind the decks and pretend to turn a knob or two while it plays but then again thats why maas is paying santos the big bucks here hes earned every one of them
tyson allard seems like a jokester from the tone of his artist bio to the design style of his voyeurhythm label to his one-off aliases like linda lovelace the erlin-based ustralian knows how to have fun or at least not take himself seriously his latest project the manga-inspired brings that attitude in force on a two-tracker that exudes the sense of someone having a lark and loving it even the beatless -side on is somehow playful with its kosmische-inspired synth tapestries (that insistent new age flute seems to wink at you every time it flutters over the patient arpeggiations ) nd theres certainly a wry humor to how allard backs a robust acid track called m with some meditative tonal ambience that said on is a transportive nine minutes just as the -side is a funky no-frills club romp neither one was meant to blow your hair back (at 114 pm seems best used to stoke a dance floors early flame) but theyll sure as hell put a smile on your face
the world has its share of raw analogue house records but most of them arent made by stephan laubner his catalogue has a consistency that recalls the ethos of reinheitsgebot ( german beer purity law ): using the fewest ingredients possible the harz-based producer has made dozens of simple hypnotic drum and synth loops that stay in your head for days the plaintive acoustic guitar in underscores its intimate atmosphere you could imagine the ridged bass notes as frogs and crickets at night its ambient synths as grey smoke rising from a campfire the drums are heavier than on say on another frequency which featured some of laubners rowdiest drum programming but the blows hardly feel excessive sometimes sounds like a disco cover filtered through hard-nosed synths and drums and its as much fun as that sounds is more familiar but even it sounds tweaked crisp hi-hats and compressed handclaps chop at the tracks bleepy arpeggio which later sounds like water trickling from a tap
is up next on the locally focused offering two jacking hardware tracks filtered through a heavy layer of crunch the -side is a bone-dry dj tool where the drum machine does most of the heavy lifting the distortion here can feel a bit heavy-handed but the swinging snares pair nicely with the bassline a groove thats tough to resist mournful piano stab provides the melodic backbone casting moody film noir shadows across the track with such a sparse arrangement its a reminder of how much magic can happen with just a few simple pieces of gear on the flip is head where the drums take a back seat to big soaring melodies those jazzy vintage synths wouldnt sound out of place in a floating points set though theyre peaking out from behind a couple layers of extra grit it shows a strong sense of pacing with synths that open slowly and steadily until the tracks culmination around the seven-minute mark oth tracks are definitely the same converse we heard on this years debut album though hes stripped the sound down to its essentials for dance floor use
new yorks c perez and londons s deelay are a new duo responsible for latest record of loose and layered sounds the two producers have collaborated before on 014s rave shadow for perezs label pastel voids but that release with its drowsy lo-fi haze seems almost rudimentary compared to the flushed and feel-good attitude on the ep features four tracks and two reworks: one by the likeminded max and the other by perezs techno alias metropol each original has a sweltering slightly strange atmosphere with plump club rhythms knocking away underneath is a quivering techno track led by dusty piano chords while and are more psychedelic filled with melting pads clipped vocal echoes and pitched-down beats on the mood switches to funky and bright a feeling the two remixes continue with even stronger results s take on with its fat drums and easygoing groove is a juicy party track and metropols charged version of has blissful piano riffs that make it soar
round the time l i e s released mimesiak the debut lp from the new york native was a virtual nobody in the electronic music scene with barely a soundcloud follower or a facebook like to his name several months on and hes developed something of a profile helped by the announcement of this second release the ep on much like the album the releases three tracks are strikingly rich in texture bringing the listener into haslams world of musically-minded techno the title track opens with doom-laden kicks before moving into a canter of coarse snares and flailing drum hits s the percussion subsides panoramic synths slowly emerge and take charge rising towards a pulsating crescendo as the drums slam back into action its a bold introduction is much more upbeat leading from an agile breakbeat into a set of infectious and subtly uplifting synths coated in rhythmic knocks and a shimmering veil of sound haslam effortlessly moulds another slice of bold enriching electronica reusing the throaty kicks from sees us back on more morose territory nevertheless with a warm throbbing bassline sharp claps and two beautifully intertwining melodies haslam injects an impressive amount of emotion into what initially set out as a slab of grey-scale techno
looks an unlikely hook up on paper a best known for his brawny house and techno and a long standing bastion of vocal house but is it really so strange fected have spent the last decade and a half building their rep on seeking out tracks from the far flung corners of house music and turning them into hits ir mix cds are a pro ction line of neatly packaged clubland snapshots for the casual dance music fan and whether you like it or not thats what a lot of house music is to many of its consumers just another tendril wrapping itself around pop musics trunk in the other corner you have who like one of his mentors sven v th has fashioned a career in underground dance music through a strong work ethic and missionary zeal s every bit a brand as fected and is clearly aware of the benefits of self promotion that said theres no doubt that is a departure from the standard fected fare feels like a coup for the latter and a successful exercise in what you might call brand extension for first cd is the most immediately digestible for the core fected audience early highlights include s echo drenched percussive workout ld (its grand puba sample no doubt having pricked the attention of an old hip hop head like ) and atthew jacking remix of s dont which borders on hip house while theres a spattering of vocal tracks theyre chiefly of the cut up variety with boratos juddering being one of the few exceptions things toughen up on cd2 s uth acts as a harbinger of things to come with its cavernous voodoo drums and screwball vocal spite being one of the older tracks here the twisted techno of s stands out not just for its pistol crack claps and blurry b bass but what mixes it into if theres one track on that will get people talking its the hyped up house/brostep of s rself transition is perhaps the most awkward thing about it as the record itself rather passes you by later to be comprehensively outboxed by r phat s foot to the pedal disco and s in strial leaning techno sprint in truth s appearance is a red herring inclusion of as well as that of arcel ttman and ad ike on a fected mix speaks volumes and reflects a label slowly attempting an image change
part two in the thanks for coming by series sees san francisco house legend doc martin mixing up an eclectic range of house beats whether it be groovy jazzy funky or even going into some breaks territory and doing a good job of it too schatraxs just for fun is the track to start the mix and what a suitable title it is - this cd is a lot of fun to listen to the female vocal sample asks the listener are you ready well ready or not this will catch you off guard and cause your rear end to groove along - sexy summer cocktail house to start things off nicely things start to build up when the beautiful flute heavy off side by ray mang and nathan dtroit gets thrown into the mix accompanied by some tribal percussion and wicked bass you cant make up your mind whether to sit down and chill or to get up and dance either way this track is a winner the breakdown in the middle should really sort things out nicely sounding like it comes straight from the verve remixed album soul supremes green tea comes in next with some more sultry female vocals to add to the mix hip hop supremo producer dj spinna along with ticklah provides a nice remix of shaun escofferys days like this and is a personal favourite this time male vocals get the attention and its good to see hip hop producers trying their hands at new genres and doing a very good job of it too deeper gets the mix going nice and deep into bass territory and gets the funky vocoder treatment as well zapp - look out scott fergusons dump days follows next with some xylophone madness - something i have never heard to such an extreme in a house track interesting jaymz nylons papolo soul gets another interesting bassline workout - getting wobbly and is a good introduction to the phat-arsed bass line of aaron carls down - very reminiscent of nine inch nails closer - male vocalist practically whispering sexually themed lyrics on top of a distorted bass line but with more of a house ethic - another personal favourite hold on is another male vocal workout and very funky - most of the tracks on this mix are funky indeed - and it compliments the mae vocals on wally calles in your arms as if they were meant to be together fantasize utilises a harpsichord tune to carry the funk and lets not forget that bass line yet again shall we however it is mainly a lead up to danmass godspeed which is my all time favourite in this mix hang on you say danmass theyre breaks producers right correct and here theyve pulled out some house beats and crafted a funky ass tune that should shake any motionless butt in the nearby vicinity scotchs super disco is the perfect finale to a fine mix utilising a drum fill with nice syncopation its easy to think the doc has messed up his mix well almost changing the feel of the track from a low down groover into some 70s retro revival and back again by the end of it youll be left feeling like something is missing yep you just want more of it not being much of a house connosieur myself this mix certainly grabbed my attention with its eclectic track selection and no holds barred attitude to steer away from the big major anthems that other cds seem to push another nice aspect of this mix is that doc martin mixes his track very deeply with each other - some songs mixing quite far into the next track the title of this mix couldnt be further from the truth you can feel these sounds
so [the track title] is kind of satire its also a political statement for people to really look at what was going on back then compared to what was happening now thats jamal moss talking about the -side of his new strikingly titled 12-inch for nt your typical 90s era / idm revisionist view in a recent interview the chicago native explains that his goal behind the elaborate names and genre references is to start discussion and inspire listeners to look into his hometowns early rave history look up woody mc ride look up hyperactive they were doing their thing back then like dearborn dj skull he says ll good advice but in practice what revisionist offers is a gloriously warped alternative to the prevailing trends of rave revivalism no breakbeats no major-seventh chords no overblown basslines here has his own tropes to invert rapidly ascending synth sequences are smeared and twisted on while its blasted kicks claps and snares wreak chaos below for all the percussive violence and manic melody the tune is loads of fun nyone willing to reach its level will be rewarded with five relentless minutes of dance floor abandon calmer but no less psychedelic must be the idm part of mosss revisionist view full of improvised digi-synth lines and a slanted groove that cant help but turn itself upside down like theres no druggy euphoria or cool nostalgic edge to the tune just a hint of familiarity among the potent musicality and unbridled creativity
- the group that brought us gay bar comes out with their new single with 2 remixes from soulchild and mainstream dances man of the moment benny benassi side a benny benassi satisfaction remix benny benassi takes the bassline effect from his smash single satisfaction and ports it over to the sound is getting quite weary to keep hearing over and over again but i suppose if youve got a winner its best to strike when the iron is hot right benassi turns into a stomping german techno styled tune with a trancey synth melody on top adding a few breakbeats into the mix side b soulchild extended mix soulchilds mix is less aggressive than bennassis version on a slightly funkier tip keeping the synth melody and turning the volume down - soulchild even add in a little guitar and funky bass to give it a funky 70s disco feel this remix has mainstream airplay tagged all over it is a song full of innuendo which is typical of and the dance remixes offer audiences a taste of for the dancefloor falls a little too much on the cheesy side for my ears though

before dance music (and techno specifically) established its universal grip the late 80s saw an outcrop of musique concrete-influenced experimental artists who produced ambient and experimental music incorporating intentional noise and field recordings lazily dubbed industrial the likes of hafler trio cindytalk and zoviet france pioneered challenging works that played with the sonic balance between quiet and clamor repetition and random resonance while leaving emotional interpretation up to the listener the industrial music era was thrown asunder when participants like psychic tv and klf embraced acid house and spooky acts like current 93 delved into folk fast-forward to and s new album which incorporates field recordings atmospheric ambience and altogether battered and distressed sounding analog machines on its nine evocative tracks s stephen hitchell and rod modell defined the depths of dub techno on their 2007 release the coldest season the duos new work extends and expands the genre based around street recordings made in japan s songs weave delicate synthesized loops and faint rhythmic sketches with random chatter subway rumblings and other natural sonorities the submerged kicks that guided the coldest season through the reverberating synth fog are now but ghostly apparitions barely audible outlines on songs like and s subtle compositions encourage active listening it takes concentration to tease out the lo-fi layers on opener and require focused attention to recognize and follow their creative and melodic arc these tracks inhabit a grey area between exceptional productions and forgettable background din; the lack of definition on often makes for a tough slog but there are real triumphs as well for instance uses fragments of a king tubby-style dub track overlaid with a steppers-dub style cadence (sans kicks) to completely hypnotic effect is also one of the albums more explicitly rhythmic numbers using just melodic loops and microscopic synth pusles to define the beat late 80s industrial artists created an exigent take on electroacoustic music that contrasted and sometimes opposed the soothing and pretty output of ambient contemporaries like brian eno and vangelis a similar way challenge conventions that have developed around dub and minimal techno while embracing a very personal and artistic approach the outcome on is both arduous and gratifying which is often the mark of art at its best
might be best known for its reissues of japanese artists like midori takada and mariah but its no slouch when it comes to new material like those records s feels both futuristic and out of time intelligent yet primitive it combines electronics a minimalist and dubby mentality exuberant solos and a hint of the avant-garde a recipe that gestures towards the time- and space-collapsing tendencies of the fourth world it also inaugurates a new sub-label pff promising contemporary electronic/experimental/dance releases a key trait of the record is the contrast between synthetic and acoustic sounds like how hand percussion is subtly layered on top of the rhythmic synth line in the electronic rhythms are pleasingly twisted and funky teeming with the subtle quirks of an organic system unexpectedly the track steadily becomes joyful as a synth toys with pitch-bent melodic lines and gurgling modulations similar juxtapositions also drive a flute trills suggestively but no one else wants to play the spacious arrangement is stark which isolates the frisky flute the group toys with near-silence and the subs are surprisingly weighty considering the loose atmosphere doesnt have s weirdo funk but its restraint makes for a solemn listen while flute and the lead lines from are essential to the overall character of its hard to ignore how strong the moodier elements are in isolation prayers for a more stripped arrangement are answered on the title track theres steam and moisture in the mix and the groove like moves in a slo-mo chug in the salon des amateurs vein producing an earthen quality the sensation is enhanced by wooden-sounding pitched percussion which pans above bulbous subs with these rhythmic and textural chops is a great start for and pff
to mark their tenth release head honchos me and dixon have chosen to license and release four fave tracks that they have currently been enjoying playing out apparently these secret weapons are hidden gems that always garner a positive response on the dancefloor what s great about an me dj set is that they know their musical history and they like to vary it up sprinkling minimal dubby tribal rhythms and tunnel vision inducers between their signature epic trance like anthems the underlying ingredient though is always in their roots in house music it is fitting then that by is an homage to old school detroit house with a fair quotient of disco funk thrown in for good measure (listen to the snappy bass riff ) unfortunately the synth lines stray too far into the realm of cheesiness and i found myself imagining this to be the type of tune played at the next defected in the house party (this isn t a good thing) by is a brother from a different mother it is a warm tribal/afro house affair complete with congos and some haunting dubby female chants very hypnotic and perfect for a sunny sunday afternoon spliff in hand the standout track and reason alone to buy this record is by after hearing this then unidentified song on an me live set i recently downloaded i spent countless hours on the internet searching for track ids and listening to audio clips at online records stores such was my determination to find out what it was a playful deep house/minimal techno number slowly and methodically builds without respite chiming in with a mischievous peak a boo melody every eight bars it never climaxes but instead subtly and effectively ups the ante throughout ideal for when the dj wants to switch gears from mellow to peak time finally by does exactly that taking us to the very depths of deeeep house ultimately though the bottom of the ocean is probably more interesting than this track it might be pleasant enough but it is never really going to pack out the dancefloor just when it appears to be building towards a crescendo it comes back up for air and deflates like a puffer fish who s realized that the danger has passed perhaps more suitable as background music in a cocktail bar even though and are decidedly average is worth the price of admission alone and you get as an extra bonus
andy c returns with the second installment of nightlife series - the mix series that revolves around andy c as the dj and his style volume 2 also comes with a bonus cd featuring andys best known works and remixes - a greatest hits package if you will and quite an outstanding feat from someone who started producing and playing drumnbass since he was 16 one of s biggest drumnbass anthems nightbreeds pack of wolves sends the mix underway fusing together elements of heavy metal distorted rock guitars and basslines with wailing vocals - its heavy enough to fill hospital wards of people complaining about neck injuries incurred from headbanging its featured here in remix form done by pendulum who lay down a half tempo introduction before building up the pressure and slam the speakers with a hard rolling breakbeat adam f dj fresh team up on when the sun goes down rinsing out more rolling breaks and hard bass which provide a nice contrast for the funky piano riff and sing-along vocal samples stalwart shimon teams up with kimani for the funky and uplifting jazz freak which features a funky double bass bassline and kimanis sweet vocal stylings are enough to get even the laziest of rear ends up on the dancefloor to have a boogie the funky vibes continue with hospital records artist logistics bringing it all together with soothing synth lines and funk licks laced throughout the funk gets placed on the backburner and the rock rhythms return on shimon sparfunks cold killa once again featuring the vocals of kimani in contrast to her previous effort she too puts down her jazzy vocal stylings in favour of a rock vocal approach the funk and sing-along factor return when calibre singing fats (mc fats singing as opposed to his usual mc styles ) offer up drop it down and in keeping to the title of the song the tune is a deeper and dubbier drumnbass affair featuring fats souled out vocals and deep dubby bass blow your whistle by reprazents dj die sounds more like it belongs in an illegal warehouse rave than a drumnbass club featuring familiar vocal samples lifted from an old skool rave anthem and a catchy bassline that will get stuck in your headspace more aggressive bass and synth follows on with future prophecies dreadlock which drops a hard and dirty bassline which sidles next to a siren like synth hook funky vibes and uplifting melodies return to the mix with another hospital records artist high contrast persistence of memory taken from his sophmore album high society incorporates funky bass thumps calming synth work and sweet female vocal stabs - quite an interesting track selection considering the tunes that feature before and after photeks remix of tubby ts ready she ready follows on and brings the mix back to hard and grimey tear out drumnbass featuring tubby ts ragga vocal chants which sit atop monster bass drops industrial noises and female sci-fi vocals ghost by sub focus danny wheeler brings out as the name implies spooky ghost like melodies - as if one were in a movie theatre watching re-runs of old horror movies before andy c brings the mix to a close with photeks age of empires bringing to light jungle horn calls and hard rumbling bass quite unfair to select that as the last track as it makes you want to hear more drumnbass rather than winding down and taking a quck break time to rrrreeeeeewwwwiiiinnnd to the first tune the second cd features andys most memorable works as a producer whether hes pulling off his own original compositions or whether hes slicing and dicing up other peoples works on remixes concept 2 - an early moniker for andy c and ant miles - are featured here with a tune from 96 cause n effect a deep techy roller which features squelchy bass lines and occasional drum fills dropped at random good for its time but it does get quite monotonous andy c and ant miles other moniker origin unknown then pull off a remix of suburban base signees boogie times tribes dark stranger which features jungle-esque choppy drumming styles rave-like vocal samples and probably due to limitation in technolgy at the time a few missed beats (especially one at the end) its probably the oldest tune on the cd and has a raw feel to it a cd of andy cs productions would be incomplete without shimon andy cs classic body rock - the tune which got the whole scene swing-stepping and more than likely confusing heads on the dancefloor as well still one cant go past that booming bassline and the swing step beats a mate was telling me that krusts warhead is an absolute classic with a monster bassline that gets the crowd cheering ram trilogy (the group made up of andy c ant miles and shimon) take the tune and turn it into a jump up classic without taking away the monster bassline adam f mops stand clear taken from adam fs kaos album gets remixed by origin unknown who take the jiggied up hip hop and propel into drumnbass territories with crossover potential dropping rocky basslines and hands in the air style hip hop vocals another tune that just cant be missed is origin unknowns valley of the shadows which is also known as the 31 seconds tune - not for it being 31 seconds long but for the vocal sample that keeps repeating 31 seconds throughout the course of the tune written in 94 the tune features jungle style breakbeats twisted synth hooks and a strange female vocal sample going on and on about a long dark tunnel is a complete package for all those who love the work of andy c both as a dj and a producer but have never been able to combine the two sides of the man into one the mix cd is a diverse mix of the latest dubplates and drumnbass anthems and shows him dropping tight mixes which as a good drumnbass dj is known for oscillate between the hard tear out sounds and funky vibes while the second cd brings out some of the best and memorable tunes andy has had to offer
rea was one of the standout cuts from s debut lp traces it seems to sum up what aker is all about in just six minutes: it was understated effortlessly cool and had a damn fine groove to shake your booty to the track bounds along on a simple bass/synth hook combo that is captivating in its austerity its velvet-clad paws are unquestionably the tracks centrepiece but they never dominate allowing the rest of the elements vaporous pads and lolloping keys included ample space to breathe with their remix urnski and explore an impressive amount of sonic space with inner city-esque stabs piercing white clouds of reverb and delay that drift carelessly off pretty much every other element introduced its dreamy and ambitious but with the bassline of the original left relatively unaltered it still manages to retain an earthy groove steve goes darker with his effort adding a creeping sinister synth that gets ever more gravelly as the track progresses its sound but the majority of the plaudits will surely remain on the mantelpiece of the original
i was asked to review s 45-minute single from the perspective of a non-runner given that the only time i run is when i ve stolen something and am trying to evade capture i was quite happy to accept james murphy presented as a soundtrack to the perfect run with all the necessary peaks troughs and breaks to keep the jogger energized and enthused the most arduous journey i make in a day apart from the one from sofa to kitchen is my 45-minute commute to work most of which is spent sat on my arse on the tube how did this self-professed work-out song fare as accompaniment well of the four loose sections which comprise it s the first which is most satisfying plaintive piano chords give way to the well-tested lcd live bass and drum chug - laconic disco of the highest order made even more agreeable by murphy s oddly soulful vocal contribution its just the kind of mid-paced sweetly life-affirming groove required to see me through the first leg of my journey that is from the door of my flat and down the road to the tube station whether the background be bleaching winter sun lashing rain or straightforward december bleakness the second section which appears with the addition of vocals as the track someone great on forthcoming lp sound of silver tends to coincide with my escalator descent underground and its sparse but assuredly positive mellifluous electro shuffle is correspondingly dreamy and mechanical the tube ride is undoubtedly the worst part of my journey surrounded as i am by sweaty miserable office workers like me being shuttled throttled through noisy black tunnels with deskbound depression as our daily destination thank god then that the third distinct passage of is its most rhythmic and melodious a glorious swirl of chattering percussion warm synths and almost absurdly feelgood brass with murphy s heavily-distorted stream of consciousness on the subject of space travel providing the wide-eyed escape from existential dread that a commuter needs just as i imagine it might provide a runner with distraction from his own bodily fatigue by the time i get to work i m feeling ecstatic as settles into its final almost congratulatory-sounding stretch job done nd not only is this track a supremely functional companion to travel in all its forms it also i can assure you sounds terrific when you re lying comatose on the sofa barely unable to move your eyelids let alone your legs bove all it s a truly remarkable piece of music that never once bores in its gargantuan duration i mean it s almost enough to make me want to go running but not quite
its not surprising that is a single-track release from its pinched timbres to its rhythmic instability the track is so distinct so odd really that it doesnt need a b-side right from the start its clear that were on unusual terrain even for who are hardly known for a conservative approach to house music the kick drum begins as a flat glassy smack with all the low-end shaved off leaving a bumbling sawtooth bassline to carry all the weight; the effect is remarkable especially compared to the bass overload so endemic to tech house these days here the midrange breathing room accentuates all manner of nuance and almost accidental-seeming sound like muted cowbells and dripping faucets eventually as the track bulks up it turns into a powerful little number with nervous technoid bass riffs trading off with percussive fills and a high-up string ostinato pulling taut the tension throughout but as heavy as it gets its impact is less a matter of force than suggestion with reverberant tympani rolling out like spotlit whitecaps empty spaces ebb checking the low ends flow if everything were perfectly quantized this would be a different track entirely an exercise in clever sound design but the unraveling grooves give an edge-of-your-seat quality hellbent and vivacious thats all too rare these days
next up on recordings are the remixes of by first up is the long journey of the classic m h rework of it must be said that this remix is as smooth as it can get with absolutely delicious baselines rolling around nicely with some very nice drums and warm summery pads it could be said that its duration is perhaps a little drawn out but sometimes too much of a good thing is just that henrik remix of follows and this remix adds a slight gritty edge to the mix on the a-side with a cheeky guitar riff used instead of the baseline drums are quite heavy but not too strong and the track really gets going once the delicious piano line enters track also builds as it progresses with some nice smooth sounds coming into the track midway in giving it a more summer feel nice set of remixes here making this quite a solid release for the crew definitely worth a long hard look

german producer and solar one music co-founder robert witschakowski has kept to a rapid clip on the release front surely to the delight of his followers twelve is his fourth solo ep of the third from his most prominent alias and it comes in the midst of an ongoing trilogy on clone west coast series ep marks the projects debut on another dutch label and as usual acid-fried techno and electro rules the day soft pads and shrill melody of make it the most uplifting thing here but even after a long almost soothing drop in the middle a forceful 303 lead returns to make sure the track doesnt get lost in the clouds and are sterner 4/4 cuts that are stylistically similar each with ghastly tones sounding off among a mass of tough drums and swarming acid riffs res a difference of about 10 bpms between them the former is a little slower and funkier while the latter is a straight-ahead rush completing the record is a remix from dutch producer unit who makes a shorter loop out of some of the originals acid and opts for slightly cleaner percussion otherwise a couple of steadily modulated beeping and buzzing synths rising high then diving down low are the main feature here making for a more mind-bending affair when compared to the originals physical heft
ladies and gentlemen welcome to my new favourite cd: after their fifth cd release a single disc featuring simon coyle in action at pureflow gets wet wet are back with an all-aussie two cd triumph featuring two livesets recorded at wet007 courtesy of biz e (calix) and voiteck wetmusik return to the underground vibe that has immortalised so many prior releases in the annals of australian techno it s also a release that many including myself have been eagerly anticipating since hearing the performances in person at wet007 read the review and you ll see that i was blown away by biz e s set and i m delighted to reveal that the cd is a similar joy to behold but one that can be enjoyed many times over transcending many different sounds from pure detroit to melodic to even some european-influenced loops this set is a lasting tribute to local techno in all its forms i found two things to be more apparent on the cd than live; one the detroity timing when dropping the bass in and the superb sounds of biz lavishing attention on his effects gadgetry it s this latter point that really endeared the cd to me: chuck it in your stereo for an instant party vibe besides regurgitating the event review it s worth noting that elvis contribution has been thankfully left off the release on the post-production tip the crowd noises aren t too intrusive (although i cringe at the thought it may be me yelling my approval in parts ) yep this is pure sexy techno on the night of wet007 voiteck s performance had received a tad more lukewarm response than calix s but i m very happy to tip that replaying the set on cd will make a few people change their tune it might not have the intensity of the ultimate in two a m techno but take the set out of a dark nightclub and it secures this release s worthy recommendation although having 23 tracks to calix s 14 voiteck takes us on a less diverse journey rather one with an engaging dark structure dare i use the quasi-clich d term this is intelligent techno just like this listener voiteck loves his ride cymbal and there it is peppering this set locking us in to a sound so synthetic it s sexy that is not to say the music lacks funk or melody; in fact the cd had me grooving from beginning to end an unexpected result after the first airing at the party a very pleasant surprise indeed after wet007 i predicted would be one of the must-haves of this year the reality doesn t just live up to that expectation it loudly reaffirms wetmusik s tag as one of the big guns of australian techno they pump out the releases they ve got the acts on their roster and if you know what s good for you they ll be in your stereo with this latest mix up real soon
since began in 2011 label heads heartbeat and francois x have committed themselves to conceptual projects just take a look at polar inertias latest ep y also release great dance records for anyone with slightly left-of-centre tastes three years in the making is the latter a collaboration from francois x and label affiliate antigone duos last two solo records illustrate where is coming from in 2014 the chiefs suspended in a stasis field was an especially driving ep for the label with a deep sense of spatial awareness antigones first outing for ken 2015s cantor dust was particularly detailed s more functional tracks like and hates sz seem to be rooted in that record but the delight of this ep is when the producers step outside of their club-ready ideas take : knocking about on its subdued yet groovy beat its in no hurry to go anywhere design of is crystalline until it expels noise like marbles scattering on glass closes with a gush of sweet synths through atmospheric storm clouds and opener is an ominous and droning ride res plenty of gung-ho action in between of course but s standout moments are meant for engaged and attentive ears
were warned against judging books by their covers but sometimes a smart exterior frames its contents remarkably well the thick auburn daubs on the cover of s new ep are quite a shift from the orderly cool seen on her breakout she said from last year though both were designed by michael cina the same could be said of the music contained therein forgoes the neat control of she said for a comparatively steamy energy crowding out any negative space with swirls of warm tones splashes of color and humid breathy vocals this is tech house with an eye to texture where the plotted rhythm design of she said struck me as overly rigid the structure here is much less deliberate and simko doesnt sound like shes consciously assembling a groove so much as letting one ride out the usual talking point about simkos transition from classical and jazz training to electronic dance music doesnt seem needed here she sounds very much at ease the rest of the ep finds simko in similarly fine form the seasick oscillations and vigorous effervescence of own set the stage for a delicate subdued organ melody that earns the track its title benefiting from its introverted melody and tough rhythm ive already heard a number of people cite this one as their preferred track on the ep margies a holdover from a 2008 digital package works a similar formula but with a brighter palette the keys a little more shimmery and the rhythms heavy on hand claps a remix from bruno pronsato doesnt hurt either continuing the producers love affair with live-sounding percussion and tendency to mention break-ups its just what youd expect of a pronsato remix mystique gathered around an enigmatic spoken utterance meticulous attention paid to the detailed networks of percussion (and lots of hand claps) and just enough melody spooled out to build a hypnotic effect its no competition for his recently released the make up the break up a novella of a track by turns grandiose and distant but thats a story for another day this remix is a very welcome bonus on an ep that already has plenty to recommend it
fter two raw and dirty oola eps returns to the smooth house sound of martinez with this new release from rgentinean the focus here as always is on the groove settles quickly into the dreamy uptempo deep house preferred by swiss producers of late ( is the airport code for geneva ) the percussion is melodic and when the song builds towards a climax the tiny riff the drums pound out goes just a little bit higher coupled with some lovely pads its a loving tribute to the sound of the city takes us back to rgentina (mendoza to be exact ) samples of people speaking in spanish begin things but they eventually fade away as the offbeat organ trades prominence with tribal deep house percussion snaking melody enters though and steals the show with its unhurried pace sounding as though it belongs in a track about 30 pm slower it makes everything around it appear more casual its a neat effect and one that propels it from being just another deep house track into something far more interesting
body ache summer is a six part ep divided into three confused not if you listen though the first three tracks form a kind of suite with a jagged violin track over a slow hip hop rhythm to make up waiting for anything then a slow moving plaintive string line preparing us for a harpsichord solo something the canadian dj can claim to be pretty unique it s oddly effective though the bricklayers union is very dj shadow long chords over a lively drum track the final two parter if you get my drift starts with a cinematic old-time movie orchestral loop and comes to a brooding finish with s own vocoded rap interesting stuff macabre around the edges and always changing focus
drew lustman aka clearly doesnt play things straight restlessly flipping between two-step house and brainfeeder-style beats his review of 0 3s hardcourage andrew ryce praised his newfound focus as a welcome trend and what does the york producer deliver next a 7-track opus of if not infinite variety certainly excursions into beatific sun-drenched lounge jazz ( ) and drum bass ( danger ) which also includes five short mood interludes a way the world has come around to lustmans way of thinking idea of provisional eclecticism half-ideas and ostensibly at-odds sections of music being stitched together is now commonplace particularly in bass music just as actress did on the labyrinthine ghettoville lustman demonstrates that an album of fragmentary pieces jump-cuts and tonal lurches is not necessarily the sign of an untidy mind its clear that every second of has been painstakingly calibrated for instance the contrast between the spectral wash of sound that is aqui the chirruping quicksilver and the gaseous ambient atmospherics of could not be more different yet the those tracks segue with the logic of an artfully programmed dj set transitions are as smooth as a magician turning over cards in an elegant sleight of hand emotionally and geographically is expansive unexpected and contradictory has the hot muggy atmosphere of a tropical clearing yet lustman builds that track up from of all things arthur russell-esque cello giving it a peculiar darkness scorched deserts of texas and xico are evoked on s not just with the familiar signifier of spaghetti western acoustic guitar but with heavy delia derbyshire-style synths you get the feeling this isnt just a desert of heat and dust but also one of sinister criminality and alien abductions you could describe the emotional tone of as one of faded melancholia but its far more complex than that even the downcast and sonically grubby tracks have moments of beauty piercing the gloom deed several tracks exist in an enigmatic third realm where abject sadness and euphoria seem indivisibly entwined keening chiming top-line and skittering tribal rhythms of seem to momentarily hark back to the effervescence of jamie xx or early joy o before descending into barrelling techno territory a voice repeats do me harm in what could just as easily be an accusation as an s m come-on is a bizarre junglist feint its vocal seemingly lifted from a badly warped cassette of some 950s girl-group people may find all this frustrating is a circuitous sprawl that ducks any a-to-b linear progression its occasionally derivative too ( could be an old dj shadow track) but for me its a fascinating mosaic in which every tiny detail lends colour and depth to a work of real high-minded seriousness
the new ep from should probably come with a warning sticker: do not operate heavy machinery under the influence of this record if you feel the onset of a headache call your doctor s sound is ugly and they know it they may try to throw you off the trail with titles reminiscent of kid606s youthfully insouciant wordplay like and but mostly theyre just interested in making your ears bleed resuscitates the squeal of aphex twins ventolin over a crushing dubstep beat with the distortion turned up to 11; starts out with a lurching lunging bass-and-drums wallop at 155 bpm a little like aardvarcks heavy metal-sampling dubstep tracks but even more pissed off and culminates in a melody reminiscent of angry hornets (or kazoo-playing madmen) fortunately its not merely about the bombast: theres a finesse and even a kind of sensuality to their brute violence it takes skill to make a sound so all-consuming of nothing more than drum machines and effects as they seem to have done brooklyn rapper and freak-for-hire sensational lends his unhinged touch to the pitch-shifting while sneaks a dissonant piano melody into its apocalyptic firestorm ending on a surprisingly dulcet note; even listeners of frail disposition may find themselves comforted by its deathly embrace

in its original form s is title aside not all that difficult to get moving to: like something marcus mixx might have cranked out if hed had a laptop back in the day its a positively no-frills party tune with one remix from the duo nautiluss in the can turbo gives us three more from label associates gingy the dvent and somewhat unexpectedly berghain resident norman if you found yourself capable of denying s pleasures before your asceticism is likely to run into a serious roadblock those qualities which philip sherburne described as subtle as nails on a chalkboard were obviously what appealed to gingy : squelchy grinding and filthy their remix makes for an even more debauched evening than the original yet theres something weirdly pleasant about stripping something so unsubtle of every last vestige of subtlety as if weve reached some new level of banger intimacy the dvent also go big but their pounding remix is pitched to larger less dingy rooms making for a more straightforwardly techno creation s rework is not surprisingly the pure-class version with deeply considered drum programming and a lengthy reverb tail on the hook its fairly obvious which version of is objectively speaking the finest production but theres something to be said for the tawdriness of gingy s iteration
has been around for a couple of years exploring the convergence of post-dubstep bass music and tech house for his latest ep on ikonika and optimums hum + buzz it seems like the amsterdam-based hungarian has given free rein to his wilder impulses the result is a collection of high-energy hybrids packed with metallic textures and pummeling syncopations its not a total reinvention but suddenly he brings to mind recent rumblings in the uks underground the likes of her records or night slugs club constructions displays these similarities particularly strongly with a welter of fractured rhythms and a hulking bassline reminiscent of bok boks silo pass the machinegun claps of show similar proclivities while what (msc) s asymmetrical halftime groove is a distant cousin of grime elsewhere plays things straighter with mixed success and have a pleasingly bleak feel but their content isnt all that remarkable partially redeems things its glitched-out clap pattern sounding like a surgical drill to the inner ear given the ceaseless intensity of these tracks most of them feel too long theyd work better as three-or four-minute depth charges rather than six-minute bombardments s main problem though is that his ambition often outstrips his technical chops as a rule these tracks are crowded and exhausting on the ear and you sense they dont bang in quite the way thats intended
is the solo project of matthew papich a member of the baltimore experimental group ecstatic sunshine that bands cache in underground circles seems in part responsible for the hyperbole surrounding his fourth record (and third lp) this year and first for post-whatever label du jour is rooted in a synthesis of certain eras the bryan ferry and compass point studios end of moneyed new wave vintage dub/rocksteady and late 50s and early 60s us chart pop moments where style and restraint bled out of the music and into its presentation and vice versa papich is essentially a collagist and all of his tracks feature samples often highly recognizable ones front and center although he adds bass heft and a palpable digital sheen much of the lps atmosphere is directly derived from those aforementioned sounds as a result can feel detached and almost artificial its like a record about listening to records as derisive as that may read it has little bearing on the quality of the songs which smartly dont bother to recreate the genres they sample transforms the ronettes be baby into a breaky workout splicing two hiccuping chipmunk vocals so it sounds like theyre repeating forever it recalls teengirl fantasys hoop dreams in its repurposing of classic pop for more energetic ends elsewhere in pairs stretched elegiac echoes with a booming dub bassline and uses a similar low-end emphasis as a backdrop for pitchshifting the phrase we are the music makers the bouncily euphoric cultivates the influence for the albums hookiest entry with a yelped slightly goofy vocal that melds with a flowing flashy sax solo papich wears his influences on his sleeve but his loping cut-up structures are a far cry from the elegant drift of say grace jones whose angular slinker guy forms the basis of is about an entirely different sort of breeziness its a bit like an imagined hodgepodge view of the pristine tropics like plastic palm trees or drinking at a tiki bar in the middle of a snowstorm
john tejada has realigned his artistic focus in recent years to pursue a melodic plaintive and almost operatic take on tech house now marking the 63rd release via his 16 year-old palette imprint the ustrian-born veteran pairs for a third time with the l -based composer and producer josh humphrey titled in reference to the analog method of synching instruments follows on from 2009s marooned and 2010s ssimilation by being an undercooked opus of bristling electronics utilising as little software as possible the three tracks vary in texture and tempo yet remain distinctly similar in their coarse style mongst the assembly a tr-808 is used to orchestrate the pulses of while rc marries a menacing swirl of modular chords with sh-101-fuelled acid reverb t times abrasive and certainly more disjointed than tejadas recent leanings this cerebral yet unremarkable release is by no means essential
i have to say i ve struggled with much of s output since he went all blues on us but i ve remained an interested consumer of his b-sides and alternative mixes which make sunday an interesting proposition whereas cd1 contains original bs cd2 goes on the remix tip the title track itself is standard fare a breathy vocal sample from sylvia robinson backed by a slightly tinny piano although the hook is a good one it reeks more of album filler than obvious single better news on the remixes though dave hedger s west london deep club mix is coolness personified whilst boris dlugosch throws a few tricks into his interpretation best track here is ferry corsten s trance roof-raiser in my heart every bit as good as 1999 s why does my heart remix the two b-sides are pleasingly soothing with iss harking back to the early ambient album not a bad thing
french record label music return to the scene with the the third installment of their various series which showcases the talents that exist on this quality french label with this release they showcase what the likes of alex millan and tom pooks have to offer first up on the a-side is alex millan with maria rosa i ll say it from the outset that this track is quite simply one of the best if not the best track i have heard this year so far pure chunky drumbeats build this track up in the first minute or so before it takes a momentary break that sees atmospheric murmurs combine with a cheeky i like it vocal sample the track then explodes into a pure driving house affair where the baseline is exceedingly addictive and the drums crisp and delightful the baseline soon cuts out and the drums go solo momentarily before it hits the breakdown where swirling effects intertwine with the re-introduced rumbling baseline hot very hot as is the reintroduction of the drums as it explodes into action once again an amazing production tom pooks adds his touch on the b-side with tonight quite a nice quirky tech house cut that rolls effortlessly with smooth crisp drums and a nice synth stab that is quite subtle gritty baselines roll on as do quirky effects that subtly rattle in the background as the track builds the stabs get slightly heavier and effected vocal samples are introduced adding a cheeky little element to a very good production a fantastic release on and one that should firmly mark the quality that is on show at this brilliant label

may be rooted in idm its run of course by mike paradinas aka -ziq so itd have to be but many of its best releases over the past half-decade have been more or less straightforward examples of the hardcore continuum from neil landstrumms affectionate look-backs to early rave to the heavy ear-grabbing dubstep of pinchs qawwali and distances demons to this lovely three-song 2-step 12-inch phreaqaflex is new yorker drew lustman aka in high 2-step gear most of the track bounces along on a keyboard riff whose tone is champagne-bubbly ut thats broken up about two-thirds in when that riff switches to something closer to the cheap swarm of proto-jungle its a subtle transition albeit one that signals the producers canniness about his roots uses the same basic template but its eerie echoed-and-faded vocal samples fussier beat programming and sparser keyboard lines are more in line with the cooler dubs that typified 2-steps turn-of-the-00s peak the real killer though is say this one is in less of a hurry than the other two which benefits it: lustman filters nearly everything in the track at some point but its spice rather than the main ingredient especially when a fuzzy delfonics sample brings things to a neat climax
hasnt had the strongest of years in but they seem to be heading out on an upswing: s is a beautiful track a tune that lumbers along with touches of funk in its background before opening up like an onion and revealing an anonymous woman who tells you how its like youre somewhere else shes right it sure doesnt sound like but curtin is new to the label and has enough a history in the scene to presumably be unaffected by passing trends taking in the breadth of his knowledge its one of those rare tracks that shapeshifts throughout while maintaining a coherent groove and thats where the push mix fails locked into a situation where its er pushing one idea it lacks the sort of malleable quality that made its predecessor so special simultaneously more upfront and convoluted it doesnt come with the same ease positioning itself as peak hour fodder finishing things off is the which works in the same way that curtins previous material has its expertly constructed and produced but it leaves little trace after its gone more fascinating than what was on eat fiend sure ut nothing compared to its masterful a-side
s br of mutant hip-hop is a pretty lip-smacking proposition at any time especially when you add rappers that are highly regarded in their own area of the world but relatively unknown elsewhere especially when its only their second single under that name since 2007s happy birthday consequently on first listen you might be forgiven for directing your attention towards the backing track but unlike the vocal tracks on birthday thats just what it is: a backing track this is more familiar as hip-hop rather than with guesting vocalists front stage is given to s heavily accented ragga style their smooth slightly drawling vocals going well with the nutty germans trademark serrated squelch is sultry attitude-tinged voice swings with rhythmic inflection nevertheless as a departure from s norm it seems like a polite move on their part as if they didnt want to steal the vocalists thunder it was done impromptu in a single hotel room session maybe that has something to do with its elemental constitution as well the same two bass notes take turns one bar at a time over the course of the track the slow drum skank is floppy rather than punchy the kind of awesome melancholy baroque towers that were built up in 2000007 wont be found here though its a shame that theyre not punching their weight boys goes for a choppy blog house reinterpretation which again is pretty st ard not seething with his usual energy but me ering noncommittally again not massively shabby but its a could do better all round
in the first minutes of youve a spacious sequence of drums keys and claps unspools soon adds saxophone curls rhodes and a supple bassline a combination that builds towards the sort of feel-good disco house for which the londoner (real name ali gibbs) is best known many producers would add a filter to that and call it a day but gibbs introduces a synth that subverts his formula slicing back and forth across the mix the discordant melody adds tension to the a-sides warm atmosphere gibbs has splintered his rich soul samples with electronic fragments before older songs like the other side and last years rye lane rhythms ep were laced with synths but the effect was sometimes incidental a spray of air freshener in an airport hangar youve finds a more integral contrast between its titular sample and unsettling chords which gives the track a resentful edge that feeling is amplified on the tip-toeing dub which continues a recent expansion of gibbss repertoire as with varkala from his soften the wireless ep some gentle soundsystem pressure is applied if gibbss music tends to conjure a feeling of luxury then is pleasure-as-usual a smooth tonic of keys guitars and hand drums that ones disco-funk is a sweet counterpoint to the sour notes struck elsewhere
patrick stottrop isnt in a rush to release music since reviving zhark recordings three years ago with sky gone but you re still here the berliner has appeared on a split ep and a croatian cassette label compilation mixed a few podcasts and done not much else the past stottrop experimented with a variety of styles from idm and ambient to grinding industrial techno and hip-hop his forte is heady rhythms and mood which come together to form zharks dark but accessible blueprint even at their hardest the results have been to borrow one of stottrops track titles mesmeric like his previous zhark ep comprises brooding soundscapes steeped in dense atmospherics that swirl in hypnotising patterns yre all dance floor tracks but as the ep progresses you might find yourself groping for a comfortable chair these are compositions to get lost in stottrop draws you deep into his world and applies layers of sound like a sedative groggy is gloopy and viscous like your surroundings are turning to mush is a pressurised dub techno track that slowly swells until it feels like your head is about to explode same thing happens on lliance which recalls dubstep as it skulks through the murk change is so slight that you barely notice it this is another of stottrops skills he can move from light to dark or meek to overbearing in a single move only the title track where stottrop adds microscopic details to intensify the head trip is sentimental s a technoid glitch early on fuzzy industrial impressions later and acid droplets towards the close productions may be infrequent but theyre always worth the wait
the sound is distinctive immediately recognisable thumping concrete four to the floor beats at a solid tempo enormous bass sounds vocal hooks and stabbed keyboard riffs over the top thankfully that doesn t mean every track sounds the same and stephan has some well-chosen guests up his sleeve most striking of all is neil tennant who wrote the lyrics and melody for the disturbing tranquilizer it s odd to hear him swear so much on record with some unusual word emphasis and dark content making this a standout track then there s samantha fox a prodigy-esque choice for sugar again an upfront aggressive sound well complemented by the vocal stephan s biggest smashes as are here also the mighty irresistible and the morillo-pleasing this beat is both still doing the business the title track camps things up edgy s vocal flitting across the speakers to a terrifically brooding bit of house leading into a reworking of the oldest track here the uplifting revolution stephan himself contributes vocals to everything u and elsewhere there are guest appearances by celeda and two miami club queens gay joy and alan t it s an exciting album hangs together well and is the perfect showcase for stephan s powerful sound the only regret is the pauses between tracks as they would blend together perfectly in a semi-mix format it s a small quibble though for what is an essentially sound album to rock the house
by has been doing the rounds for quite some time now especially after chris featured it on his bedrock mixed album quite some time ago now it looks set to finally get a full release on fortier s very own on the a-side is the main mix and it features the trademark sounds of a fortier production the intense tribal like drum patterns as well as the floaty atmospheric elements make their mark on the production that also features some strong vocal touches as well turn it over to the flip and you firstly have the very solid deep dub the mix that featured on the bedrock cd for good reason too as it is a very solid production with good flows of subtle sounds and effects but most of all a very chunky baseline with plenty of groove the reprise follows and it showcases the vocal elements as well as the atmosphere of the main mix and dub a pretty solid release here on fds but you can t help but feel that the wait was slightly too long
for second outing on offshoot hype ltd they light up basement percussion with a disco ball as with last years plain clothes the alian duo present solo efforts with lucretio stepping up first both his tracks sound like some grimy l i e s cut for the first minute before female vocals slowly bleed in to offer some softness on this comes from a drums n all disco sample with the original percussion rubbing up awkwardly against lucretios redlined kicks s a similar story on only with an r b sample and whirling arp tempering the rawness the ep highlight comes from marieu who opens the flip by twisting bill withers harlem into a fear-drenched techno banger its kicks landing like sandbags around muted acid burbles never has the lyric everythings alright sounded less sincere closer eschews the vocals and grit formula preferring instead to dose a 303 with amphetamines and let it loose in a hi-hat factory as acid goes its pretty ripsnorting but it also feels the least innovative stick a soaring soul sample over the top and youd be onto something
for the third 12-inch on chrissy murderbots and alex burkats nite owl diner the chicago label taps its first non-local toronto producer has no problem fitting in handing over four lively house tunes its a notable departure from the heavier bass-loaded techno hes released since 2011 which makes 3 feel like a fresh start for graham bertie everything is brighter and friendlier; even when bertie mixes a rolling drum break into he softens the edges with new age pads and wispy ambiance gives the ep a spirited start with some help from : the pair piece together an impressive groove out of pounding disco beats elastic bass notes and a few tasteful samples to lend it all some soul its the eps most charismatic tune as bertie eschews hooky melodies in favor of synth textures and bullish percussion and dole out their melodies sparingly like a mother rationing sweets to her kids while theres nothing too wrong with this bertie doesnt fill the space where a sticky bassline or striking refrain wouldve been 3 has no lack of effective house tracks but it couldve used a couple more memorable ones
its never good when melisma sounds like the product exhaustion or pain as it does in this actually pain can be a righteous catalyst but in this case on top tiredness its more like mild discomfort something nagging and bothersome but not enough to register as anything but just bland sounding weirdly like shes preoccupied with a bunch errands she has to run later vocalist holly backler does house-diva duty in service some fatefully fizzy words: lets make the most this moment tonight (that last part presumably helps differentiate the track from others that celebrate moments worth seizing say 48 hours prior or two weeks from tuesday ) its bad but fair enough: its house and avowedly old-school house at that yet backler isnt done any favors by a track courtesy germanys manuel tur that lumbers along with a lot weight and very little character theres no air in it to the point where the simple rising-note sequence and the big meaty beat squeeze out all the deep house soul that it seems to be going for turs own dub mix it does better by cutting the vocals to smaller bits and pushing everything into a sort zoned-out state that state figures as well into the 13-minute original full length demo mix which benefits greatly from room to stretch out and changes scenery through a few different rises and falls backler sounds sharper when less fully in focus too which could stand as something a lesson
though it produces a measured stream of charming deep house jimpsters freerange imprint seems to offer few genuine shocks is another chapter in that story drawing on a fairly standard palette of sounds and surfacing with an accomplished but altogether modest result at this point its almost a clich to describe chords as swelling and yet thats the best term for the title tracks central motif like shore-bound waves each iteration rolls gently in the wake of its predecessor cresting with little ceremony these smooth movements are offset by curt snare stutters wispy hi-hats and other clattering bits of percussion essentially the whole track is built around one main moment around halfway it begins with a very bare breakdown and adevas famous histrionics filtering cautiously into range from here the vocals build to a simple restrained peak before everything else kicks back in and leads towards home the raw mix of is a touch heavier and favours a loopier construction again burnished chords make up the tracks guts with quietly tinging percs running alongside them like this relatively constant backdrop is used to set up the tracks climax; another breakdown where an achingly cool flute and rapid-looping vocal snippet take the reins axel s two remixes of are where the release really shines the first stands out mostly via its parched-sounding syncopation which has been programmed with enough tiny variations to keep it interesting for seven full minutes around this dominant structure works in snippets of the original cut reducing the main motif to a two-chord chiming in contrast the second remix sounds muffled by heavy rain nearly all the high frequencies seem to have been dampened resulting in a low-key but no less interesting cut
if there is one constant in the world of dance music it is the ubiquity and proliferation of trance specifically the sturm und drang of the dutch trance sound offered up by the high profile trio of ferry corsten dj tiesto and one van buuren s career has been on the rise as of late: the man cranks out compilations at the same rate tiesto did about 4-5 years ago he s in high demand for dj dates worldwide his radio show a state of is pored over by the trance massive with the same scrutiny digweed fans follow his kiss show and if his career continues along its current arc he is the dj most likely to unseat tiesto from his three-year run as the people s favorite in the annual dj magazine horse race does massive popularity translate however into artistic vitality (one also wonders how popularity affects artistic decisions but that s a whole other kettle of fish ) is s first artist album (we won t count 76 ; that would be like saying the qat collection was sasha s first full-length album) it s being touted as a major step for (him) into full songwriting but if do you purchase this album don t expect anything innovative or groundbreaking it s a mish-mash of guest vocalists stabs at eclecticism forays into breakbeat and the requisite big moment in other words a fairly inconsistent work that misses far more often than it hits the sound that armin van buuren both embraces and promulgates is fairly limiting to begin with and it is evident in the lead track wall of sound featuring justine suissa (avb s previous vocalist from burned with desire ) is big-room breakbeat trance executed in a standard but effective trance-by-the-numbers fashion: the vocals are dreamy and sultry and it rises and peaks exactly when it s supposed to anyone who regularly posts on tranceaddict com will eat this up empty state continues in much the same way this time using the dreamy sultry (yes again) male vocals of mic burns to a more pitched-up beat (slated as the official anthem of sensation white the world s largest indoor rave) is an anthem in big neon pink letters just as it should be this is van buuren hitting on all cylinders and one of the few shining moments of the album things quickly go downhill from here there s the mid-tempo breakbeat track golddigger which simply shouldn t be; zocalo a collaboration with gabriel dresden that feels like studio leftovers (spaghetti western guitar lines don t work well in a trance motif); and who is watching featuring iio s nadia ali which sounds like for lack of a better description music you d hear after your massage at a day spa there are but two other bright spots to be found on bounce back a decent go at progressive done in collaboration with fellow dutchmen remy and roland klinkenberg and the best track gypsy a punchy breakbeat number that melds quite effectively with the vocals of ray wilson complete with lyrics that are not gratuitous pap as is so often the case in vocal trance production work as a stand-alone production by armin van buuren gypsy is the biggest success of the album; one wonders what would have been like had all the productions featured the same fully-formed connection and focus that it delivers on i recall my interview with sander kleinenberg who mentioned in passing how difficult it must be for trance djs to break the mold that makes me think about tiesto s nyana which actually included three fairly hardcore techno tracks as the opener a ballsy move i thought for trance s standard bearer the point here is that change and progression comes slowly if at all in the world of trance; none of that is to be found here
i still think theres a lot to experiment with with 140 with that tempo mala told me a few years back in an interview for little white earbuds if it feels like hes the only producer taking the sentiment to heart its worth listening to the first physical release from rob booths scene defining podcast cum record label featuring four tracks handpicked from ees mammoth digital compilation released this summer this heavyweight ep isnt the platonic ideal of dubstep nor is it exactly what youd call experimental but its contributors do thoughtfully refine an aesthetic many have been quick to move on from anonymous beatsmiths (whose mix for ee was something of a sensation) turns in the most techno leaning cut here but even if comes in ten bpm short of classic dubstep its syncopated rhythms digital sound design and meaty low end check off every other box formerly of various productions uses a nearly identical sound palate on hersheys to a very different effect adding overdriven grime vocals and pushing up the tempo to get heads nodding more than any of his previous punch drunk releases s moodily reverberant (and tantalizingly brief) recalls that labels early output likewise s expansive sounds more like martyn than martyn has in years stylistically conservative but never safe comes off as less a low end timewarp than a glimpse into how dubstep might have moved forward

this year latin and caribbean sounds invaded club music between naafi in mexico city bala club in london salviatek in uruguay and new york crews like kunq these cross-cultural experiments have led to some extremely fresh ideas the sound tends to be dark and confrontational from kamixlo s cybernetic textures to imaabs apocalyptic ambience and santa muerte s rat-a-tat drums continuing the tradition is the stockholm-based producer who with this ep for his label has staked a claim as one of the scenes most inventive producers teeters close to the edge of gabber and hardstyle this kind of speed and intensity is only a notch or two higher than the caribbean party music youll hear on the radio in new york dominican dembow tends to brush 150 bpm and merengue can easily exceed drum bass tempos that might be why these rhythms feel so natural alongside distorted kick drums and saw-wave synths as is the case on the eps killer title track a collaboration with berlin-based producer is the most psychotic cut here its a wild gabber-dancehall hybrid that smacks of early bong-ra or kid606 though the plucked strings give it a distinctly feel where that ones likely to clear all but the most adventurous dance floors se al is comparatively easygoing with a sparse groove and smart drum programming the high production values rarely dip across the release from the rave synths to the percussion and sub-bass s deft mixing makes all of the sharp textures and high-speed rhythms feel that much more approachable
as one shadowy half of the avian label alongside shifted ventress has played no small part in the uks recent turn towards all things industrial his own output however is limited to a pair of 12-inches for avian and edit select which outlined a highly sculpted brand of pitchblack techno minimalism producers debut ep as appears on a 10-inch sub-label of avian that purports to cover more esoteric and experimental techno noise drone and industrial sound labels launch didnt come as an enormous surprise given the ongoing merger of post-punk-informed techno in the downwards/sandwell district lineage and the off-dance floor output of labels like blackest ever black (as if to close the circle the artwork for this ep comes courtesy of juan mendez aka silent servant ) and are proficient but not stunning each built around a single rhythmic churn over which white noise parched delay trails and arid daubs of synth swirl unevenly with its abyssal drone and bleached-bone percussion is better as things progress creeping layers of hi-end emerge from the gloom as if were exploring some forgotten subterranean complex on the title track london duo return a favour ( remixed their track old life last year) supplying impressionistic squalls of guitar over plodding synth bass result however is rather limp
in a q a with resident advisor almost four years ago suggested change was afoot this year im trying to reorganise myself he said since his debut around a decade ago zap has built a reputation through deep house enriched by elements of jazz and dub in 2013 he released water a debut album that merged a reliable dance floor formula with hiss-laden ambient and drowsy tempos subsequent eps have edged towards other styles including breakbeat and maurizio-style dub techno zaps tweaks on bapbab are more conservative on the he lets a gristly chord loop unspool as dj tools go it has more charm than usual a staccato bassline which stumbles and skips over the tracks chewy grind offers an exit ramp for djs looking to transition to lighter material sturdiness makes way for instability on the where zaps sci-fi sound library is set loose an arsenal of pings and bleeps echo in aqueous dub idm-style drums stutter and seize up while zap binds aspects of actress and aphex twin into an accessible whole zap wears these styles effortlessly but the music most recognisable as his own is equally compelling the gently psychedelic b-side where zap adds acid as a brooch-like accessory is where he shows his truest self
the steady ascent of matt lambert and jacob martin k is one of the success stories of ristols new house generation sure the duos productions may lack the rush of newness found in some of their peers (or for that matter in martins solo productions as hodge) ut house music has a storied history of refreshing its heritage and lambert and martin take up the baton with aplomb fter a steady run of singles over the past two years the pair will shortly release their debut album through ased on we can expect a natural progression from past efforts namely tracks that are minded of the past without tipping over into pastiche is the fractionally stronger of the two a blissed-out deep house anthem that manages to nod to new jersey without flagrantly ripping off kerri chandler (a difficult thing to do going on recent evidence) unusually lamberts keys-work is pushed into the background with a sampled vocal taking centre stage the whole thing displays a newfound discipline a keener awareness that less can be more meanwhile gives the keys more space to breathe letting wafts of powdery synth drift across its sun-kissed surface though a vocal still takes precedent the bassline alternates between a full-fat ashmore-esque affair and something more far dexterous s ever its the subtle touches that make for compulsive listening

when theo does a remix he undertakes nothing less than a complete archeological excavation of the original work he looks at the materials used evaluates their historical relevance in dance music and after pulling the entire work apart and putting it back together he finally ends up with something between a reinterpretation and a complete revision of what the original track means here he s working with something approaching a kindred spirit if anyone can really be said to work on s level in discerning japanese producer takahashi and the results are every bit as stunning as you might hope his remix of ll begins with a single fingered synth trying to piece together a long forgotten melody while a kick drum softly nods away wants you to see these joins where his work is pieced together all the better to appreciate the history the grain of the music this remix of the original vocal track is beautifully elegiac with the vocal alighting on the beats like a butterfly on a pin but the dubstramental version is even better nine minutes of hypnotic beats and understated interwoven analogue grace notes it s like dancing close to but not quite with someone you desire your rhythm and theirs almost but never quite interlocking you re unlikely to find a more elegant and sublime expression of the possibilities (and impossibilities ) of the dancefloor whatever the genre
despite flaming pyre of 979 disco never actually died its just been hovering outside of our peripheral vision occasionally darting back in full view under different guises it throbbed in background of early 80s punk funk it was sliced and diced by hip hop filtered and looped by parisians with french uch it loaned its strings and diva vocals out house producers throughout 90s and it s mped and grooved within rhythmic changes of rapture style indie dance in its most original form however is clearly making a comeback of sorts: it has slyly hustled its way back on more and more non disco dance floors over last two or three years w that we can clearly join dots from mancuso and moroder cerrone and rthur russell via larry levan and francois k across metro rea and prins thomas and currently tensnake and horse meat we can all wave disco flag without fear of ostracism or musical arson if re is any one art who has been as wholly committed joining those dots before during and after those awkward in between periods its danny dancer best of balihu is a neatly chronological soundtrack his s ry from seminal look ma drum machine ep in 993 which spoke of his roots as a vogueing disco fan in late 80s new york and chicago club scenes through his development as a re edi r producer label head arranger and r with all good biographies its secondary s ry arc that provides real drama here s musical journey s his youthful enthusiasm for true musicality and obscure disco began compete with a growing dissatisfaction with business and a perceived lack of musical integrity around him results were seen heard and felt his personal messages on balihu inch label b sides shifted in ne from spirited dialogue ( mysteries of house: whats woof woof sound in love break ) a swiftly forming idealism ( if you want it done right you gotta do it yourself ) a frustrated critical perspective ( days disposable tracks with no musicianship variation or originality ) messages mirror s own evolution as a producer from sampladelic jump up boogie jams like and juddering s mping pared down and considered disco house fusions that experiment with italo philly (spot double exposures classic my love is within ) space disco and tightly wound funk breaks but things began with 993s and its remarkable how timeless and unspecifically retro this breakthrough track still sounds with s earthy arrangement its a watertight party starter with some decidedly oddball elements: tinpot percussion is fudged with reverbed handclaps background strings are a single unbroken looped note flatlined out in eternity and melody is a constellation of flashing neon and firework bursts even after 6 years its rambunctious leftfield funk still tries get fresh with you as it reaches out and grabs you by hips 997s mood mylar marked a new era for as he did away with samples al ge r and proceeded rewrite rules of modern disco based music increasingly utilising analog synths live instrumentation cosmic electronica and early house signatures dsr ( rt drugs sex rhythm) casually combines chicago acid squelchiness with spaced out cosmic disco as if y were most natural of bedfellows this is final balihu release a three track adieu from 999 temporarily drew a line under everything of two non tracks s 3 yanks at heartstrings with a melancholic and surprisingly modern take on melodic electronica which skirts around a trip hop breakbeat and abstract electronic noises presumably contributed by a remin enthusiast underground disco compatriot kickstarted labels surprise third act in 00 with insouciant spacey groove of manning keys of a vintage korg 6 on and s arrangements from this period like metro reas defining lp that came a few months later laid down a deep electronic disco blueprint for modern nu disco both and balihu have been all but silent for nigh on a year until this compilation a release that reportedly only came about after some prompting from dutch label rush hour lthough has stated that balihu is dormant and not dead this excellent and exhaustive collection sadly has whiff of posthumous celebration heres hoping n unlike most good biographies that this particular disco protagon will return from beyond for a triumphant fourth act
uwe schmidt and tobias freund know a thing or two about live electronic music schmidt is the man who with less than a days notice managed to locate and program a rack of classic roland machinery in order to fill an absent ricardo villaloboss headlining slot at mutek one year nd freund is in some sense always a live musician; his recordings both solo and with max loderbauer as non standard institute are heavily based upon improvisation (we will ignore the irony that he also worked with milli vanilli ) so its no surprise that the duos collaborative output skews heavily towards live recordings 1993 record for the ongaku and rising high labels elektronikkaa 1 2 / electronique was taken from 1992 performances in helsinki and montreux paris logistic label has released sets the pair recorded in 2004 and 2005 in paris z rich and valparaiso hile this recording on the label catches them live at erghain on november 15 2009 with 24 minutes of music split across two sides of vinyl the -side picks up where the -side fades out but both sides begin with heavy downbeats in deference to js their kit has changed somewhat in the past 18 years and musical tastes have shifted but schmidt and freund continue to do what they did on elektronikkaa 1 2 sinking the audience into a web of beats in nonstop countermotion of the two artists freunds signature is more apparent: recalls his solo work as tobias with a pummeling thrum of 808s and tumbling three-against-four pings reminiscent of classic s hk monosyllabic vocal samples add to the intensity while the acid-inspired bassline keeps things grounded there are no real peaks or troughs across the 11 minutes just endless choppy waters and a chrome horizon whether coincidence or not sounds a lot more like schmidts work as tom tm with contrapuntal arpeggios driving forward like some perpetually transmogrifying juggernaut a riot of syncopated bleeps and shifting waveforms it peaks halfway through its 13-and-a-half minutes attaining a degree of controlled mania that sounds like 1993 all over again; its long decrescendo burrows into a tunnel of muted toms and distorted high end and the whole thing peters out with two minutes of robot death gurgle
mathew jonson danuel tate tyger dhula and colin de la plante are back as but nothing too dramatic has changed in the canadian quartets quirky approach to techno lead track is the eps most traditional dance floor moment although its by no means straightforward it has a bubbling pot of parping brass and piercing synths while an oscillating bassline moves almost absent-mindedly up and down if the title of k se suggests something a little more left of centre you wont be disappointed far from being cheesy its difficult to not be lured in by the lurching fro-caribbean rhythm that paces its length its the sort of idiosyncratic dance track that you could imagine ndrew weatherall creating in his sabres of paradise guise is the most jazz-centric of the three tracks a six-minute improv spiralling around a syncopated organ and pitted with synth quacks and tic-like percussion

s cynosure may not be known for diva vocalists but ten years will soften any labels heart just a little bit sees shannon collaborating with berlin-based singer fadila who says her piece four separate times on vinyl with very different backings shannons mix is a piece of rubbery tech house that eventually swells to include shimmering keys which allow for fadila to float in and out of radar range ricardo villalobos meanwhile turns in a remake that at first at least seems unremarkable until he switches over snare to a slimmer version for second half and similarly gives only a little help to fadila making her haunting center of attention on flip deadbeat does honors providing a typically dub-wise take on original while sound palette is similar to much of what deadbeat offers in his usual work re is an urgency that is often absent from his purposefully drifting dub here he means business pushing things forward and dragging fadila along with him closing things out rozzo of mountain people does what he knows best drafting a bouncier house take on original one that is happy to add in its own deep bassline and keys its least successful of three; nei r properly ebullient nor restrained it carves out a middle ground somewhere in region of mediocre none less with three o r versions worth a spin youll likely find a mix to play here with no problem at all
while theres a certain disconnect between the at the helm of 2003s classic leave luck to heaven and the thoroughly crossed-over of today reconciling the two doesnt require too much in the way of mental acrobatics: you can hear dears pop impulse rattling around behind leave luck s still-straightforward techno a drive hed mostly severed from his club music roots by 2007s sa breed and fully grown into by the massive murky black city last year dears latest the four-track ep finds the new yorker continuing to explore what it might mean for him to be a pop star even going so far as to bring in some outside help on the production end is the fruit of a collaborative session at brooklyns rare book room studio between dear and the swedish production team of van rivers and the subliminal kid whose similarly idiosyncratic take on pop helped birth fever ray co-producer angle honestly strikes me as strange since dears vocals have rarely been the highlight of the records hes put out under his own name jammy in form and thick with loopy percussion is a start but its a bit disappointing considering its pedigree the re) however finds dear at his best with of drums on lead vocals dear can really dig into the beat which with touches of hip-hop and waterfalling organs might be one of his best solo tracks and a round out the ep the former sounding half-lost to the night (in a good way) and the latter like a 4 m rainstorm with dears lonely falsetto in the caress of quiet mysterious drums
has connections to berlins bass cadet records it started out as a youtube channel for browsing deep and dusty house releases from f t f who inaugurated this vinyl-only label last summer as well as other treasures from unknown names proper record store curation goes into it with each track set to its own oddball clip of found footage from a burning car to greased-up bodybuilders to a slow-mo shot of a belly dancers navel is also the only place on the web where youll find waitress whose copy1 is the labels second release the records a-side is an eight-minute sojourn fleshed out with barreling drums and metallic hits technoid figures rake through a balmy melody that drops halfway through ushering in a breezy calypso vibe on the b-side something ethereal a disembodied voice maybe floats above the first untitled track and a gutsy kick binds it all together with other low-end frequencies the second ones hollow drums rattle on loop before the whole thing changes into wispy dub techno every now and again that first percussion pattern emerges sounding closer to gentle rain on a corrugated roof it has a subtly transportive effect
a long time waiting for the fans of faith which first appeared on deep dish s global underground moscow and now finally gets its release alongside it we have s latest work in everytime with a remix by bc faith (mv s moody mix) mv gets all moody on this proggy number as his mix starts with low thumping bass drums that build into a fluid grinding bassline subtle synths and vocal effects rollover a simple collection of high hats and feels quite soothing a very solid mix to say the least faith (original jericho mix) the jericho mix is another progressive interpretation that feels a bit darker than the above mix as there is less melody and with the inclusion of haunting vocals that ring out the breakdowns are deep and the stabbing synths give it that little edge everytime there is no doubting s production skill as everytime gives this impressive ep some rather large legs everytime is a pumping groovy and emotional piece of work the pace gets you on your feet; the percussion kicks off the track and then knows when to take the backseat; the deep chanting vocal is moving to the bone has also added an extremely impressive stringed breakdown my eyes are swollen all i can say is that i believe everytime (bc s darktime remix) jamaican born bc who released swtich it on yoshitoshi brings in the dark times with a percussive mix that is bursting at the seams this mix belongs in the darkest clubs as the basslines are so low they move the air around speakers high range sounds tweak over the original deep vocal fluidly

until recently s name was always prefaced with his underground resistance affiliation but now its fair to say that manuel gonzalez is formidable in his own right having released consistently strong eps for wild oats trilogy tapes and dont be afraid his latest ep (and his third for dont be afraid) is a collection of uninhibited acid tracks thats easily the equal of last years if youre reading this and shows that gonzalez has no shortage of ideas or deft ways to execute them s eps never stick to just one mood and resin is no exception jaunty arpeggios of assumptions seem to rise and tumble from under a cloud of steam making for a claustrophobic opening thats quite at odds with what follows living up to its name is machine-funk with a sensual edge to its robotic groove contrast to that tracks forward momentum the acid lines on the beatless swirl prettily and reprises the relaxed vibe with impressionistic synth curlicues and spry chords dotted over a bouncy groove mood shifts again on the more vital and urgent with acid lines careening in all directions and jittering drum-machine hits if resin sounds like a mixed bag rather than a coherent ep it never feels like one his trick here as elsewhere is to write grooves so infectious they sound timeless

s its name suggests the dark side of the pony pt 1 is an altogether more sombre and twisted cousin to jay haze and samim s more lackadaisical (albeit in its own bizarre psychedelic unhinged way) album released last year children of love the dark side is sort of a detroit yang to that album s yin an unforgiving and druggy landscape where sub-bass beats pound and synths simmer evilly -side is a seething slow-boiler; great shards of bubbling acid break and dissolve across a molten landscape of frothing synth and imperious brooding bass s the pressure lifts (and it does so in the tightest most austere way possible no hands in the air moments here) more industrial-sounding tones come in like acid-house construction workers interrupting proceedings in quite an exhilarating way on the -side is like a druggier more submerged and warped cousin to steamy synths fizzle bubble and gradually gather pace as the same brooding bassline crawls on ominously great nasty hot sheets of static burst across the sound-plane as an increasingly anxious-sounding riff lifts the track into something more urgent and directional ll in all feels like the soundtrack to that part of a night when everything suddenly seems to spiral slightly out of control and everything starts to blur together into one great synthesis of rhythm and sound dark and twisted delight
disc 1 : yr093 duo sandee rivera and j sealees are no stranger to making pure quality releases fortunately for us their classic i want you has been brillantly mixed by two upcoming producers luke fair and holmes ives lukes vocal mix features on the new satoshi tomiies gu nubreed cd luke fair remix very impressive mix which utilises subtle noises and deep synths while keeping the track upbeat the original vocal is used without any filtering and is left to do the damage the distorted guitar adds great affect on the breakdowns holmes ives dub deep blissful house with low beeps and lightly scattered vocals great 4am track both mixes have been firmly slotted into dj boxes with the likes of danny howells and deep dish giving it the thumbs up my thumbs are up definitely
it was only a matter of time until and dan curtin linked up both artists love vintage synthesisers melody and driving basslines and are favourites of djs who trawl the spaced-out section of dance music where deep house intersects with techno from city lights zerbsts second ep of lands on curtins label and collects four tunes that were in case you couldnt tell by the quick tempo produced in the 90s two are dance floor killers that sum up why this sound is so loved the others not so much the standouts nd and way are both around 140 bpm with simple kick-snare patterns and fidgety basslines way the more reduced option is especially nice thanks to its easygoing groove and a snaking acid line its one of the more straightforward tunes from the red ember camp but also one of its best and are less subtle they start steadily but pile on harsh synths and pads until they become a mess luckily for us theres enough heat elsewhere to make from city lights worth picking up

if youve watched s quarterly crate sessions youll see hes a fount of musical knowledge with a diggers passion to match if youve listened to a mix of his or better yet seen him play youll experience the knowledge and passion come together with some serious flair his productions have tended towards the heavier side but as an advocate of variety and ever weirder strains of techno his label is where his maniacal and more whacky intentions make interesting bedfellows then is business as usual: four ardent techno monsters with quirky kinks is the most industrious of the lot sounding properly like metal clinking upon metal and taking absolutely no prisoners it uses what might have been a vocal sample once now its an ambiguous growling sound that gnaws away in the background is cut from the same cloth but is a shift towards the peculiar bubbles buzzes and bleeps abound in the perky number albeit in an amphetamine-induced up-all-night sort of way which makes seem like the gruesome aftermath crashing down to earth with strange distorted sounds

is best known as deepchord the creative force behind popular dub techno records such as vantage isle and the coldest season but that moniker is just the tip of the iceberg modell s back catalogue is enormous encompassing ambient and sound-art releases on obscure labels which even the discogs radar doesnt pick up: imprints such as silentes hypnos amplexus linear logic and silver to name a few modell s latest album incense and black showcases the breadth and depth of this oeuvre more abstract than his gentle dub atmospheres more varied and violent than his ambient work it is a record of hissing coiling atmospheres that stands as a cross section of his output taking in everything from the glitchy drones of his releases on silent records to the hard-edged techno of recent live deepchord performances based on ten field recordings made during a single night (presumably in japan) the album is ten discrete snapshots rather than a cohesive whole or narrative an album of dark environmental explorations then it seems like a shift in focus for the label too the oddly named is otherwise known for albums of low-key leftfield minimalism with gently poppy elements that fall somewhere between the sound of 12k and morr music the standout track is which is at its best when heard loud after the laidback dubbiness of modell ramps up tension with undulating waves of sound over steady beats the beatless but forceful that follows should also be turned up loud in fact it s clear from the first moments of the vacuum-powered opener that all of the tracks regardless of tempo benefit from high volume listening including the sheet-of-sound drone-dub of elsewhere modell s signature atmosphere infuses the vignettes with flanges and delays blowing through windy spaces on and modell makes a show of his lighter side on funky melodic and vaguely oriental its squelchy beats sound almost over the top in the context of this catalogue of reductions and it s therefore the only track to tip the balance of the album dangerously into soundtrack territory nevertheless incense and black is both soothing and harrowing in equal measure and it has a breadth that will appeal to fans of modell s abstract works as well as those interested in the darker side of deepchord
has a defiant attitude that matches his label a new york outfit that casually drops albums and confounds expectations for fun his deconstructive or even just destructive style generally has two modes: he can bang out techno like a natural as with last years fashion lady or his stunning debut new hat or he can pulverize beats into dust the way he did on last years above ground his new one the inscrutably-titled proudly takes the latter approach for what might be his most dumbfounding release yet wakng thrst is confrontational the start taking a sharp turn away the techno of fashion lady and heading into much weirder territory re are still drums but theyre forced into lopsided patterns like the garbled garage of for and or the feet-dragging thud of suppresses an insurgent breakbeat with a wall of filters while seven-minute centrepiece hearkens back to his own techno work taking it apart until its a series of chimes and percussive devices that stutter like cellphone interference those are the most accessible parts of the record rest of it flies by in bursts of speech and noise some 30 seconds long some three minutes as a result wakng thrst seems confused about what its trying to do drowning considered standouts ( ) in a sea of distorted muzak ( ) it sounds like took whole songs and sent them through a shredder and while that kind of reckless method can be fun it could just as easily wear on your nerves its not as if doesnt know what hes doing tongue-in-cheek has all the uplifting power of a hymn slowly blooming with brilliant streams of organ a reminder that hes a capable of a lot more than he lets on but his mind wanders constantly even if wakng thrst has enlightening moments like or theyre surrounded by a minefield of sound collage and brutal distortion that can be a real chore to get through s at his best when hes focused and there isnt much of that here
last years tensile was probably the most straight-up techno production real name matthew watts has made to date but aeolis mons from 2015s sampler is a better example of the curious sound design hes capable of now the three tracks on his first ep for see watts experiment more with deconstructed bass music and grim techno strange sound design is still key to the style there are warped voices in the most fidgety percussive and banging track on is clanging psychedelia and is dark and tunnelling the latters metronomic pulse offset by scuttling sounds makes it a highlight especially when it really gets going turns the dripping sounds of some abandoned industrial space into the queerest and best beat here sergie s remix is less interesting but a lot more functional ossia breaks things up even more his version is for the old dubstep heads and modern bass converts who prefer their techno chopped up into bits
organic analogue is a uk label appealing to people who fondly remember the glitches of vhs and the warped sounds of old tapes it does this excellently with fringe artists and retro-futurist sounds putting out acid electro breakbeat and techno from jeremiah r hvl and dj guy its fourth record nabs another off-the-radar producer who fits the agenda: rephlex artist david barnard known sometimes as david monolith but here as in the early 2010s barnards debut ep and lp appeared on rephlex and the artist was suspected to be aphex twin himself not so it turns out but barnard (who also hails from the english countryside) crafts similarly agile and complex rhythms in the brain dance vein after releasing a decent amount of material in the last two years collects some of his dreamiest sounds the ep is an intricately composed streak of rhythmic textures with a focus on cold atmospheres and emotional melodies even on its most synthetic-sounding freak outs ( ) the music offsets razored blips and breaks with gently lapsing backdrops and both bottom-heavy electro cuts have a slower motion to them with sci-fi details and quasi-ravey piano riffs that drop a soft glow onto the tracks this soothing energy is something barnard indulges in further with the eps end at two minutes long the sad drawn-out strings of set the mood for the beautiful morning rave track that closes the record is melancholic yet uplifting layering lulling chords and old-school piano over a speeding electro jitter is a special mix of mind-tingling craftsmanship that gets at something deeper in the soul
following in the tradition set out by sebastian san mikkel metal and others continues mission of of producing deep sound collages that stand as objets dart with the producer is firmly in his dub techno guise while robag wruhmes excellent remix raises both the groove and the artistic flair a few notches sounds very similar to sweet decay a -side on 2008s electricity its club effectiveness though is more obvious: the bilious folds of white noise and echoing stabs are reduced slightly in favour of the chugging rhythm allowing it to push the track along with more momentum s an example of quality atmospherics it flows and smoulders throughout its length with a space-filling aesthetic that would suit an early-night set aiming to push people under the wighnomy rother meanwhile offers a mix that bumps along with strings suspended above a semi-organic machination of hollow rhythm and bass the dubby delayed/reverbed stabs are still ostensibly at least in prominence through much of the track ut its far less straightforward than the original with inspired little elements taking centrestage reserved beeps for a period; churning snares that up the motion about halfway through; fuzzy vintage vocal samples logic states that these should all be fairly normal basic inclusions but together they have the uniqueness and form of a rothko painting the design of the tan coloured vinyl gives a good idea of whats on it: these tracks are simplistic and unassuming yet supremely cool
its ok / to fuck all day sings barbara markey on its a track whose moral compass points to the nearest red light district its much less clear whats being said on the a-side of which samples a thai folk song and braids the babbling vocal around staccato prince funk and steady skin percussion rolls neither of which sound at all related to and its cheeseball yacht rock balladry leonid s collaborative l i e s debut is strange fucked up and one of my favourite records of the year the black label series from l i e s releases dance floor oddities now and again spsss latin boogie freakout bigote for instance but theres nothing that matches the sheer cheek of much of the eps source material ranges from whimsical to quixotic but when waves a wand over and its (with help from and respectively) it turns both into devastating dance records on the former warbled vocals are warped into a drunk doughy lullaby that wanders over hand drums and splashing disco snares its on the other hand comes off like a dinosaur l track gorged on cowbells whistles 303 squelches and markeys salacious come-ons sandwiched between those two is whose unvarnished romantic strains yearn for a top gun love scene its completely out of place but on an ep that doesnt care about where things fits it couldnt be more at home
go to fractalfantasy net : its where you can fully experience the interactive audio-visual work zora jones has been producing with sinjin hawke since 2012 began as a platform for the pairs video series the music of which was eventually released as a compilation last july jones has since shared 100 ladies and a compendium of rap and r b bootlegs that you can grab for free musically joness bass-heavy deconstructions use vocals in much the same way as a sha devi or visionist have recently helium-high and stretched beyond anything recognisably human they squeal and coo like a choir of robo-seraphs often bleeding into the musics bleeps so far its been an all-female and fairly ephemeral affair but on teklifes adds a weighty dimension to the mix his staccato phrasing brings the track closer to footwork too which creeps through the mist of joness delicate choral sprays dva delivers another of his hi emotions remixes which as ever its a raw-nerved ride through several sentiments at once the way he pulls you in opposite directions could be a turn-off but for me its the selling point you never know where youll end up on one of these trips: this one stops starts and shudders along through bleeding-heart r b and on to somewhere much darker twitchy and skewed and back again its a fantastic piece of imaginative club music

n his review of restless dylls the 2013 debut album from camella lobos project aaron coultate described the music as bleak austere and bare-bones he also remarked how the la artist had crafted a signature sound that is sleek and addictive and would be fascinating to see where it goes though lobos first release in two years the three-song hasnt gone all that far from restless dylls its no less fascinating for how it delves deeper into her signature space all three songs were penned by lobo herself after which she brought in joshua eustis (telefon tel aviv sons of magdalene) for more production and mixing you can catch subtle updates in the alternate version of a moody track first released on this years cant give you life you want vinyl-only compilation smeared reverb clouds and smoky synth swells are thickened and widened so dense now that lobo seems to float through them like a phantom obscurity works well with her voice the further we feel from her soft melodies the closer we lean into them the more the surrounding murk engulfs us newer songs and further this approach and while using the same eerie palette of spindly guitar minimal drum patterns and rich synth tones ts remarkable how arresting lobos simplistic compositions can be with only the slightest chord changes or arrangement shifts a testament to her songwriting and sound design having shed s post-punk tropes and other inessentials gets to the heart of what makes her music powerful
the bedrock original series mix by desyn masiello for me is one of the highlight mix releases of the year so far and it should provide the dj community with some joy seeing that bedrock have decided to release 4 of the tracks from the album over 2 slabs of vinyl first up is we got the muzik by sebastian ingrosso john dahlback an absolute stormer of a funky house track the production builds for the first few minutes leading into a massive explosion of the main baseline and beats a moment that would have probably stood out for many on the album the track features another nice breakdown midway and maintains a good level of energy throughout on the flip is perhaps my real highlight of the mix album that being joyous loop by community spirit the track has plenty of admirable qualities those being the very nice drum loops that continually change shape throughout the track or perhaps the unmistakable melody that gives the track a great summer feel another good strength is the very subtle vocal riffs that feature throughout the track first up on the second disc is prawler with frisco another pretty funky affair but with plenty of solid beats and strength to the track the flow is pretty smooth throughout and despite the funky edge the track is quite minimal in parts and remains pretty smooth for its entirety finally all nite long by stylophonic gets a notable inclusion on the vinyl pack a track that really set the mood early in the mix the production features gritty synth patterns and crisp beats that give the track an irresistible flow especially late on as the track hits an extra gear with some uplifting moments a very solid vinyl pack of a very good mix album as with many vinyl packs some might be disappointed with some tracks that were not included but the ones that were are quite solid especially the fantastic joyous loop
we know very little about bristols outside of a few facts hes an old jungle head whos been part of his local scene since the late 90s and he makes techno informed by that background like so much of what comes out of bristol s music is spawned from and is made for soundsystems bass is key but his moods and melodies are just as important no matter the style or bpm this has all taken the form of sub-heavy techno on acid and electro for happy skull icy ambient on ancient monarchy and even breaks for blackest ever blacks a14 and all throughout the catalog airbrushed atmospherics and other daubs of bygone junglism have made tunes like shores caladan stand out has specialized in stirring dance floor riddims but on he shelves that approach in favour of more listenable compositions mood and melody are now at the forefront which hits a heart-tugging peak on it swoops in on tender strings a soft-grumbling pulse and what sounds like the wispy fragments of a siren soon bringing in morose chords a sad sax and more ethereal strings its quite beautiful as is a serene and woozy wash of synth with the sparest amount of percussion at the other end of things is the aptly titled crawling on its belly through murky dub textures everything on this track sounds the most fully grounded in bristol there are swirling oppressive atmospheres and the paranoia of too much weed smoke its minimal broken percussion plugs into the citys dubstep legacy but this isnt a head-nodder nor is it all about bass in essence is a headphone album which has been clearly crafted with a bigger picture in mind if theres a fault in that its that has downplayed some of his strengths in pursuit of a subtler sound but doesnt have to pummel to leave a mark

following last years triumphant lack ody radiation s latest project looks like a classic bit of post-album steam-letting his series of ten 10-inches will be focussed on club tracks and less experimental a return to no-nonsense dance tools after the loftier demands of an lp on closer inspection the first instalment isnt very distant from radiation s lurid post-punk-techno that album wasnt far from the dance floor even at its weirdest and these two tracks retain much of that charm they are however a bit simpler in construction is about two things: the unyielding thump of its kick drum and the swaggering acrobatics of its bassline is stranger centring on a sampled monologue rendered unintelligible by wayward pitch-shifting three-note synth hook and another steely kick drum prowl underneath like caged beasts waiting for their moment to strike
return to the forefront with a release from hungarian producer with a quality record in already receiving plays from sasha and chris fortier amongst others this release comes with a solid original mix and a remix from sterio mcgrath on the a-side is the original mix the track begins with a very solid drum loop complete with a simple baseline that chugs along underneath the track builds as an atmospheric soundscape soon encompasses the production a subtle melody makes its way into the track as the track soon enters its climax in a deep and minimal way it s a solid progressive churner this one on the flip is the sterio mcgrath s transformation remix sometimes in a release the original is overshadowed by a solid and slightly more inspirational remix in the flip this is one such release the remix starts with some pretty standard drums however the atmospheric elements of the track are very impressive shimmers of sounds flash in and out of the production as do the sample sounds of astronauts in action the drums and effects build throughout giving the track a fantastic summer vibe a feature of the breakdown that occurs midway showcasing the stunning atmospheric effects these effects climax in the latter half as the track erupts in great style a delightful remix quality release here from with the remix on the b-side deserving special mention check this out
theres a story to be written about exactly what kind of influence collaborators have on the music that comes out under the name timo maas loco dice nja schneider ellen llien or dj t each has famously at one time or another enlisted equally as big names to co-produce records and then released them under their own name for t k thomas koch that has meant a long-term relationship with ooka shade who have helped craft /tweak /crystallize the producers sound into a loving tribute to chicago house filtered through a european sensibility this year however koch worked with matthias tanzmann (on outbreak for his usual get physical home) and ian pooley (here on this poker flat 12-inch) nd as a result you cant help but want to pick out differences: whether it be in outbreak s sexy stutter-shimmer or in the light tribalisms of efore s drums theres no reason to question the result though like outbreak may sound different but thats a good thing koch et al seem to have embraced get physicals big room outlook with the labels equally-as-important classiness is melodic enough to niggle and rhythmic enough to make you forget its minimal with a splash of tech house with efore being the mirror image in name and in sound there the drums are smoothed allowing for the aforementioned tribalisms to take hold underneath and for that melody to niggle once again this time emerging more as an adjunct to the rhythm than competition is it pooleys influence or is koch calling the majority of the shots im not sure and im not sure it matters much either
printed on the sleeve of daniel s new 12-inch for is the line the past is a foreign country they do things differently there sure enough its a fitting entry point for these three tracks which all look backwards for inspiration but instead of simply returning to the past cherry picks some choice sounds and ideas to color in his futurist techno hybrids where video game samples in electronic music are often used to evoke those pixelated bits of nostalgia and render their blippy synths and fx into almost unrecognizable forms like its namesake the title track is hectic and deadly searing the dance floor with its fragmented jungle rhythms blown-out sub drops and ghastly shrieks the tension in that one is less about the sounds of a frantic video game than the joyful panic of playing one follows suit albeit in a more fun flurry of neon streaks and high-speed propulsion you could imagine the loopy arpeggiation throws over the top being lifted from some classic racing arcade game though how it works in lockstep with the rolling drum pattern overshadows any outside references only sounds wholly derivative it could easily be mistaken for a soundtrack cue from a romantic final fantasy cut scene on some magical seaside but it works just fine at the end of after all the mayhem and excitement its rewarding to sit back and take in the surroundings
jeremy nderground first gained attention through is nderground his vinyl only label launched in 2010 helped revive a particular style of pneumatic 90s inspired house he slowly gained a reputation as a major house nerd a man with encyclopedic knowledge of kerri handler b sides and little known merican record labels he also displayed a broader love of music his tube channel he shared an array of obscure jazz soul and disco from around the world he also dropped fantastic home listening mixes in 2013 i saw him play at plastic people spinning an amazing set of mysterious rare grooves alongside floating points and red greg i was left with the distinct impression that jeremy was an excellent house dj but perhaps an even better soul and funk dj beauty is jeremys first downtempo compilation his credentials to curate such a release are matched by laremont whose originals compilation series was one of the decades best beauty is the second release from the laremont sub label spacetalk which is run by psychemagiks danny mclewin the pair met after jeremys soul and funk set in eos a crew bar run by block 9 danny was impressed a friendship was born and the decision to make the compilation was solidified there and then beauty features some of the best records jeremy has discovered so far the music is often pleasingly difficult to categorise theres s a soul track that features jamaican musicians who usually perform in ska and reggae bands theres s which has a folksy soul jazz vibe s bossa nova rooted disco and s funky library music the pick of beauty might be eed this mind blowing smoky soul cut would have been a huge hit had it been released on a big label as opposed to a tiny company from glassboro ew jersey reissue culture has arguably never been more vibrant the likes of bbe music from memory and umero group unearth a seemingly never ending stash of vinyl gold but in a crowded marketplace beauty stands out the laid back vibe and sparkling musicianship on the album makes it a pleasure from start to finish in my 2014 review of jeremys previous house compilation is nderground i said if youre at all interested in playing old school house music on vinyl then this is an essential purchase by that logic if youre into soul and jazz records you need beauty in your life

after years of djing around the world what the result yes jetlag and tinnitus the title of this remix series of tracks by the ever-wonky mr of which this is the fourth installation those familiar with s label will know what to expect: an individualistic and trend-bucking collection of tracks each different in its own right but what happens when you create your own trend and what if you fall into the trend of bucking your own trend havent thought of that have you si that s to say that while this ep is packed with fantastic sounds with few straight beats in sight it feels like more of the same the intro dub of is incidental dungeon atmospherics while the crystal remix of is great tech-mashup material for electronica-heads chugging along with a slimy bassline and scrunched-up drums before blasting us with robot battlezone noises and solid stops and twists it s the best thing on the ep track three sounds like an inferior version of vip from the original remix ep typical ian bleep-step but basically an aimless collection of sounds on the b another remix by ill (geddit ) et al is a monster dub brew soaked in reverb with not a bar untweaked the second version has a healthy playful video game sound offset by the fact that its basically a hit and miss collection of related loops which doesnt really go anywhere finally marvins mix of is an electronic curiosity that does what it says on the tin building an increasingly venetian snares-esque collage all the right ingredients are here and this is probably worth buying solely for the crystal mix but perhaps its time for to leave this series maybe get an ear checkup and some sleep
i discovered the music of matt rowan late last year his release on l2 music the new funk was a refreshing track which blended funky house and progressive house in a unique way and showed that this young man had a lot of talent here he makes his vinyl debut on hope records and teams up with another talented producer jaytech to create tomorrow/blaze tomorrow starts off nicely with some tough drums and lush pads before an electro bassline breaks in the track then builds up before the main bassline comes in which is a funky beast fans of chris lakes recent productions should definitely check this one out as it is very well produced and along similar lines blaze on the flip is a different animal though starting again with a tough drum intro and some nice pads the groove on this is slightly different it has a much deeper feel and though there are nice chord progressions and uplifting stabs there is a groove that comes in about 3 mins into the track that reminds me of breeder the chain which i like the production on this is superb and is definitely my choice out of the two tracks overall this is an excellent release from hope who have started the new year strongly i predict big things from matt rowan and remember where you read about him first
are the latest addition to an american label and collective focused on melodic and vaguely hip-hop-oriented electronic music other members include citymouth brownbear and soft metals and associated acts have included devonwho and shigeto to give you an idea this particular duo of hobbes and qloq hail from olympia washington and their rather post-rock influenced debut ep sounds quintessentially pacific northwest in its build is the sound of temperate rainforests light peeking through a densely layered shade of evergreen if that imagery wasnt enough to get it across skews to the darker and more solitary side of the pastoral and opener sets the mood forthrightly as synths and strings heave and burst dramatically in the folds of plaintive guitar plucking that sits somewhere between bernard sumner and explosions in the sky the motion here is decidedly laidback methodical in its whimsical sway; maintains its determinedly smooth oscillations even through glitchy samples voices and alarm sounds theres a definite formula as even the slightly more pushy where the guitars are pushed along by fat bass notes and the drums finally hold some weight consists of mostly the same identifiable elements as the other tracks the eps one longer-form moment is the highlight and its less a beat track than a meandering amble preferring a laboured one-two step as it traverses twigs rocks and other surfaces as the guitar alternately murmurs and wails quietly in solitude
on s discogs page a user jokes your mission should you choose to accept it is to buy a record before its sold out this hints at the hype surrounding australian house producer jordan alexander hes released records for just over a year but his sizable discography (and its inflated resell prices) point to a producer on a roll with his dusty laidback party cuts fitting somewhere between route 8 and galcher lustwerk now for unknown to the unknown presents more haze and sensuous vocals samples but where alexanders music would usually groove this ep bangs out the three tracks have their own twists but they all come together with punchy percussion and stinging blown-out textures ive bumps a late-night house beat through the contrasting combo of deep mutters and shrill synths giving it a kind of screwball flare a charred and airless drum track has a gouging rhythm that erupts into a searing throb halfway through surely alexanders most brutal work yet on the title track things return to a familiar house mode with bright keys and a vivid uptempo swing its joyous mood is only heightened with a vocal loop that shouts knock the fuck out keeping s mean spirit alive
anthea co-founder of brouqade taps molly for the first ep on new label the american-born has been on the rise in the growing minimal house scene and her sets tend to be fun and breezy with a heavy emphasis on big basslines and memorable melodies her productions can be a different story though particularly as of late following her loopy but irreverent multiverse ep for brouqade inaugurates with three of her steeliest tracks yet is this genres equivalent of going straight for the jugular its got a hard swing that feels like an elbow in the face and theres not much melody unless you count the eerie hum in the background its loopy to a fault akin to the fussiest romanian house tracks and without much to set it apart the other two tracks are the meat of theyre warm and inviting trading s rigid attack for a big bass-heavy hug is more spacious and trippy and its dynamic with spirited bursts of hi-hat keeping it from locking into any one phase for too long the ep closes with its best cut full of cute synth curlicues and an organ line that sounds like its melting over the bumpy rhythm like s best work its quirkiness never gets in the way of the groove
s eats in space records reaches its tenth release it can already look back on a richly varied and consistently high-quality catalogue from the psychedelic jams of rnado wallace and the lovelorn electronic pop of jee day to the spacey electronics of secret circuit this ep from japanese pair crystal s koshi sends the label hurtling off into another new direction namely unashamedly maximalist rave nostalgia and does so in fine style title track is very much the main event here it bursts straight from the blocks in a flurry of beats and euphoric vocal snippets which are joined by an irresistible dd terje-style piano riff that joyously carries the track is more understated ased on sweet looping keys and mid-paced drums it has a slight feel of incidental videogame music to it making for a pleasant if not terribly compelling comedown from the glorious excesses of the -side

ells the 12-inch released in collaboration with pev on earlier this year marked a turning point though his earlier records on deadplate and well-rounded were perfectly good singles they fell short of being spectacular ells was the record that made me sit up and take real notice of and his first solo release on peverelists label delivers on the promise thats been bubbling for the last couple of years a piece of heavyweight dubwise techno shot through with the revivalist jungle influence thats been so prevalent of late is among the best things has released moody synth lines echo in deep space and glass smashes the spookiness amplified by a rush of drums the tension between the suspenseful spaces and percussive onslaughts make it seem both elegant and blunted its careening motion is subdued slightly on the gloomier pace is offset by a web of restless rhythms and an undulating bassline that sometimes leaps out the track the whole thing monolithic but teeming with contained energy
what is it exactly that makes house deep finnebassen the norwegian producer born finn peder wang makes records youd be hard-pressed to describe any way other than deep house but his palate on the ep a collaborative effort with vocalist gundelach doesnt descend much further than the surface: thin and acutely digital his claps strings and even vocals feel frosty and foil-like to the touch the lonesome title cut the remix from swiss duo adriatique and moody original all reveal an obvious passion for house at its most human extended runtimes aside these are songs first and foremost production-wise though theyre too one-dimensional for us to really slip inside jay s remix of however flips the script the berlin-based producer a veteran of compost and buzzin fly sounds every bit as digital as the rest of the set but in his prickly rhythms and added low-end heft you can feel the heart beating behind the machines still turns in a relatively straightforward club production but whatever deep is exactly he lends more than a little of it
caps off a strong for berlin-based londoner the year saw him grace radio 1 with a mix remix us artists like youandewan and timothy blake raise his profile on numerous festival bills and release two eclectic houndstooth eps but hawkes downplays his momentum with these three unassuming house tracks all of which find him making the most of simple arrangements and soulful sample fare you might expect more risks from a record called but its sturdy and straightforward throughout where houndstooth releases raw materials and sweet featured a range of ideas from jacking drum machines to cheeky boogie-house to deeper grooves this ep sticks to a bright disco bent in the vicinity of 123 bpm the focus serves hawkes well even if it limits the amount of use djs could get from his record with its hands-in-the-air exuberance garagey shuffle and dynamic filtering will likely catch the most attention that one and the funky bounce of both owe a fair amount to classic todd edwards so the lack of sample cut-ups in is a nice divergence hawkes keeps the mood light and adds no more than a sprightly synth pattern and disco strings to the drum-centric mix it comes off like a modest dj tool next to its warm celebratory counterparts

ren schofield was an early leader in the technoise movement a loose group of producers in americas noise scene who gravitated towards techno as he makes volatile dance music that feels like its constantly on the verge of exploding his debut album of grizzled hardware workouts simply called felt downright dangerous when it landed in 2011 since then techno absorbed this new wave of artists and noisier sounds became the norm for his third full-length (once again called ) schofield responds by going fast and hard in a way that makes the last two sound reserved doesnt fuck around at 27 minutes and seven tracks its a barrage of white-hot jams theres not a moment to breathe minus one small break in but even thats plagued by a high-pitched squall where previously schofield might have let a groove ride out for five or six minutes waiting for a spark to catch flame here he turns up the gas high and lets the tracks burn themselves out in quick brilliant flashes even more intense than adhesive his previous high-water mark but as brief as is it isnt simple and theres plenty of variety some tracks have a spiky ebm quality others take on a low-slung funky feel like or the tortured-fax-machine screech of schofield goes straight-up techno with a detailed production thats eventually torn up by a searing synth lead all of schofields records have been great but seeing him live is an equally crucial part of the experience his sets are abrasive and unpredictable switching gears at the drop of a pin and feistily tearing into new tracks when you least expect it does a much better job at getting this across than his past records did the first two lps laid out pieces of the puzzle but here theyre crudely jammed together into a jarring whole each new track lunges to life barely half a second after the last one finishes which hardly gets less startling even on the tenth or 20th listen might be ren schofields shortest album as but its also the one that best captures the full elemental force of his music
sheela rahmans second ep of the year is also the first release on her own label gyrocyre a gyrocyre as she helpfully explains is a creature that manifests itself when people hold built-up psychic tensions under the skin [and] the energy gestates in a womb-like growth until its ready to burst through the flesh if the backstory doesnt tip you off that this label will house some pretty dark fare then the track names on its inaugural ep will ( and could be titles from venetian snares cartoonishly aggressive era ) is largely tooled for club use specifically the scariest clubs imaginable was clearly written to represent gyrocyres namesake and it steals the show among an impressive quartet of tracks its febrile pulse eventually ruptures as a roaring fleshy coil of bass machine-gun percussion and far-off screams cascade out into the open is the records straight-ahead ultra-murky techno banger while the title track pairs swarms of keys and bass with lava-flow atmospherics buries its percussive whirr and zig-zagging machine scrapes for an immersive closer has taken us to these kinds of dank depths before andrew ryce used the phrase techno dungeon nightmare in his review of her debut album but if is any indication theres still plenty of life in the formula

over the past few years theres been a surge of interest in scenes clustered within distinct geographic communities: footwork in chicago kuduro in lisbon shangaan electro in the south african townships theyre all different of course but they share a certain appeal they sound new especially to foreign audiences and offer local subtext to a world of electronic music that has become increasingly globalized the latest such genre to get an international spotlight is gqom it comes from south africas second largest city the southeastern port of durban and sounds like some long lost strain of uk bass music: lithe broken beat with the ominous tint of early dubstep and grime but it has a slinky distinctively south african feel its made by kids opening up music software for the first time inspired not by dance music popular around the world but by the legacy of local durban sounds the first time i heard gqom was last summer when uk grime label goon club allstars plucked three tracks out of durban for the rudeboyz ep it was an immediately addictive sound with a swagger that felt almost dangerous new label oh goes back further than that ep to january of 2015 when italian nan kol stumbled on a soundcloud stream with the gqom tag he fell into a world of music that he and practically everyone else outside durban didnt know existed employing his friend lerato phiri as a south african point of contact kol dug deeper into the scene aiming to shed light on the artists making gqom without exploiting them or appropriating their sound in that sense the labels first compilation is a resounding success kol and phiri have no narrative to get across other than the sheer breadth and variety of gqom which they accomplish over 12 productions oh the sound of durban is a marathon gauntlet of throbbing grooves and pounding drums and its rarely anything less than pure pleasure these tunes approach gqom from a number of angles theres the aggression of s africas a warlike battle anthem with early 00s hip hop sounds and s fearsomely quaking but there are also funkier more savvy moments like where a woodblock hit hugs the contours of its broken beat has a playfulness and flamboyance that you wont find in the other songs the quality and vision of the compilation is staggering it seems unbelievable that a sound this potent could have developed without anyone noticing which comes to down to the circumstances of making and sharing music in these close knit scenes is distributed peer to peer via small networks beyond major international platforms often shared in low bitrates and tagged improperly its a hard world to keep track of if youre not a devotee like kol so the sound of durban is a crucial introduction to a bustling scene that already counts hundreds of tracks and plenty of producers yet offers no easy way in

you start off as this blank sheet of paper this innocent thing and then life starts bending and folding bending and folding im still being bended and folded we all are when explaining the title of her new album to pitchfork suggested this process eventually makes us into a beautiful piece of origami but her tracks which she composes from beginning to end without going back to make structural revisions emphasise the turbulent folding process over the outcome her unique and overwhelming new album doesnt present an attractive finished form so much as an identity in the chaotic process of taking shape this portrayal of identity as provisional and complex isnt the only way in which s music recalls 20th century modernism her striving for originality her taste for darker themes and the stream-of-consciousness unfolding of her tracks all echo the movement in one way or another she cites the ground zero of musical modernism the controversial premiere of igor stravinskys the rite of spring as inspirational but perhaps she shares more dna with an expressionist like arnold schoenberg whose discordant music dug deep into the anguished subconscious theodor adorno wrote that the depiction of fear is central to music like schoenbergs told pitchfork that in making music you have to face things about yourself you dont even want to face i have to go into a space that makes me cringe every time i go there this cringe carries over to the listener is more refined and sophisticated than the indiana producers debut 2015s dark energy but its no less brutal if anything its sharper and certainly denser expanding on 2015s between-albums track the spartan drum palette associated with chicago footwork has been joined by a wild battery of percussion on tracks like and trilling hand drums and tom toms cowbells and flickering shakers spill out in triplet cascades punctuated by clipped vocal samples on and fiery closer military-style snare tattoos up the ante even further other tracks make fleeting contact with the world outside s mind her footwork roots are most audible on the holly herndon collab 1 with its panicked klaxons and battle-ready voice samples was made from a loop of baltic folk singers sent over by william basinski and features wordless singing from halcyon veils fawkes the latter track is the only break from the albums rhythmic assault by this point youre gasping for one ( reportedly asked the albums mastering engineer to tone down its sonic aggression; it remains an eardrum-scorching listen) this is another way in which is a modernist: shes not afraid to make her art difficult in fact she almost treats difficulty as a virtue (in the pitchfork interview she hit out at ambitionless producers: you made something cause it sounds good for real youre not doing enough ) can be intimidating: its dark relentless and makes substantial demands on the listener but its also powerful and distinctive in the world of rhythmic electronic music nobody else is doing it quite like this
just what the hell is going on in sweden right now probably nothing that wasnt before only now were aware of it here another swede with some beats to trade comes to market on behalf of german label try getting your mouth around that one after a big night out the side is a pacey little number reminding this reviewer of early uk tech house around the 130bpm mark ctive beats carry a somewhat deep synth loop with pads which is where it loses me a bit maybe suitable for some faster floors the speed and dynamic percussion dont really seem to gel with the more sombre melody the bassline does has a little bit of groove so maybe its meant for warming up a techno event with on the geitflug is more of a chugger though far from slow with all manner of odd metallic noises reverberating in the background as a few live guitar notes are plucked out over more active percussive rhythms chock full of edits its got definite what was that value useful in the right time and place bout halfway through a deep slowly modulating bass comes in with a short playful synth loop which really suits this track what its come down to is whether you want to hear those guitar notes throughout the track and have a yearning for all manner of clever effects scattered around in all this release bucks the trend for a lot of music coming out of germany now - its not slow and it doesnt rely on synth work the does have a slight identity crisis but for the more out-there clubs the could work really well
is a brand that we have come to trust in a very specific way her titanic records her collabos with apparat each of her releases is a hallmark by which other comparable recordings are judged (and therefore hardly ever vice versa) so when she turns a corner what do we say exactly on we find our berlinette greatly defrosted from the icy postapocalyptic machinations of sool exhibiting an emotional openness that recalls the warmer moments on orchestra of bubbles albeit with much gentler pluck-n-click percussion work this is a summer record tracks like and juxtapose a droning low end with a cheerful clean guitar alliens ethereally accented voice provides the usual ghost in the machine while sunny chord progressions via pad and hornsynths lift the tunes out of monotony highlight plays almost like a formulaic rock track a healthy fuzzy bassline mashy strumming and a clockwork 4/4 structure lend it probably to stateside airplay and with fever ray firmly in our minds we know that weird distorted foreign girlvox isnt a straight turnoff even find chillwave dance making an appearance on crystalline melodies and a sleepily funky bass throb ensure this simple single is as head-clearing and addictive as huffing pure oxygen a dubby tropical track finds the likeability sweetspot as allien intones what can we do over a simple earworming music box melody its the sort of a track you would want to magically drip out of the crackling tree-mounted speakers on some beachfront bar on koh phi phi (or perhaps bar 25 ) not all ideas are as fully fleshed or compelling takes a silly ascending bass scale and peppers it with some snappy snares and then lets it run for five minutes occasional atmospherics and vocal snippets enter and dissolve but basically this is your standard go-nowhere cut if berlinette is the sound of an electrified europescape in the last nights before the end and sool is the breathy muttering of runtimes in the aftermath of a post-human world then is the first inkling of a new primitive hunter-gatherer civilization of sentient androids that just sort of want to chill and drink daiquiris despite a few sonically unimaginative moments i for one am definitely down to hang out and watch the sun rise over the healing planet

so the story goes like this: released in 2001 with no artist or title information s minimal techno blue print gets rinsed by the richies the ricardos and the daniel bells over the years to much fanfare followed by many internet track id requests searching its name and where to find it then in 2005 hawtin decides to stick it smack dab in the middle of the climax of his acclaimed transitions cd/dvd creating even more buzz s inbox gets so full with requests to re-release that his computer crashes and erases his hard drive he curses hawtin vows to never produce another record again and checks into a monastery to ponder the meaning of life i can t confirm that last part but what we do know is that samuel finally succumbed to the plethora of positive communication urging him to get this track back on wax which the fine folks at were more than happy to accommodate sound engineer by profession samuel uses only computer software to make his tracks and this one was done before the days of bleton live etc making the production that much more astounding without getting too tech geeky on all y all it s extremely impressive that this track was created using only six samples and a reverb effect yet it easily stands up to and sounds like anything that is being produced today using the most modern technology okay so what does it sound like n upbeat moody number bounces along with a playful melody and an almost bluegrass banjo picking intensity to it a la duelling banjos (minus the inbreds) in short quality stuff which has already stood the test of time snap it up before it disappears and youre forced to bother jeff again
renowned as the central label behind new weird finland fonals more accessible releases of roster acts like kiila and often seem to get unfairly overlooked in the face of its more broke-toothed tangle-haired projects label-head sami s np kkil the man behind has quietly established himself as one of the rosters most consistently compelling acts one which pokes and prods around the edges of the innocent and wondrous sami composes with an almost charmingly na ve sense of experimentalism thats particularly hard to categorize but instantly recognizable if when the night draws in fonal acts like eleanoora rosenholm and shogun kunitoki streak the woods in search of firepits and small forest carnivals you get the sense samis at home locked in his cabin-room making shadow-puppets in the fading light from the grainy turntablism of a love cycle through the masterful pseudo-ambient sprawl of sateenkaarisuudelma samis albums are rough evocative blurs of classical music avant-folk and a kind of garbage-can sonic playgrounding theyre long-walk records forest-camp records green and twilit embracing both the goofiness and serenity of youth for his fifth album kes maan samis noticeably restrained in comparison to his last two recordings summing up in a tidy forty-four minutes but the kitchen-sink approach remains: the records waning-summer sounds play out on everything from analog synths and violins to trombones and broke-ass casios the albums title translates as the children of the summerland and theres a deep spiritualism in the way he sets about to aurally retrace both the fuzzy nostalgia of childhood and the open freedoms of summer that almost approaches the hymnal the title track in fact is downright churchy with its delicate organ patterns and water-splash field recordings a bit of tattered god-music for those who seek solace instead in memories and bright pasts s teet recaptures that songs patient mood-setting an upright piano slowly finds its own pace against a steady synthesizer line that grows in voice and volume as the track evolves like many of samis most idyllic creations it twinkles more than it really glows cushioning the listener in a soft flickering light thats meant more for atmosphere than navigation but kes maan also indulges in a childs play kes hymyilev t warbles into a disjointed frolic of casios; samis voice sounds moon-big reverberating across the tracks spastic noodling like the lone voice of reason in a world of crayon-walls and lego-furniture elsewhere drifts along on so many blurts of noise and faint choral washes it begins to sound like a boy sugar-mad with creative lusts flooding the room with as many sounds and parts as he can play with two hands and one foot of course thats the goal samis set for himself here: sketching the messy beauty of summer in youth those finger-paint days years of invention and the grace of game
when it comes to house music prefers a straightforward approach all three of his eps for chez damiers balance have been called untitled and their misty deep house has always been similarly to the point his latest outing was his only original solo material of 2014 and it showed three different shades of his production style the opener is as fierce as weve heard from in fact as rock-hard kicks stomp beneath a sinister female voice and erratic drill noises you could call this his first foray into techno but that mood soon shifts: s trademark punchy swing and gossamer synths push the track into more temperate climes if that was him dipping a toe outside his comfort zone then is back on familiar ground 60 seconds of dreamy pads are suddenly severed by a heavily accented caribbean voice sample dropping us into a danceable swirl of stabs vocal shimmers and urgent hats showing off his softer side s own remix irons out any bumps by bringing the soothing billows to the fore its a simple trusted formula and one that has down to a science
- is radioactive man monoak (a freerotation artist) and simon ynch from ondon modular alliance the producers worked on their debut ep at hackneys curve pusher studio which gave them access to a goldmine of equipment ( ynch brought his own modular synthesizers naturally ) the result is a four-track record that shows off an expert if conservative take on electro that should satisfy genre heads and gear nerds alike is pure drexciya worship but its an engaging tribute full of shrieking synths and hard snares comes from the idm-influenced school of electro (the kind you hear on central processing unit or shipwrec) and thanks to glitchy percussion and bright synths theres a spring in its step despite the melancholy mood is the stiffest track but its weird details no doubt the product of having three gear wizards working on one tune offer plenty to chew on only on the aimless techno diversion and does it sound like there are too many cooks in the kitchen
its been a while since has released on his own label io two years according to discogs however it was only last january that the scotsman presented new material anywhere with tom a busy three-track ep in contrast is pared down with a strange sense of disconnection between melody and percussion s is usually the case with watson there are multiple layers of the former with oscillating filter sweeps and a plush arpeggio taking the fore early on the disconnected part hits about a quarter of the way in a series of wistful lengthy chords which sound as if theyre being played slightly out of time when the kick comes to an abrupt halt later on however its revealed to be a trick with everything perfectly in sync quite a good trick too the ensuing breakdown is surpremely emotional so much so that watson reprises it to finish the track irish duo psycatron occupy the -side with a more reserved take hollow subterranean kick leads the proceedings with the originals emotional synth lines allowed only to creep into hearing range rather than burst through euphorically t certain points their impact is blunted further with the flying chords tugged downward their pitch slowly lowering until they melt into the bassline its just as impressive as watsons cut; its their uses which set them apart the original is an overt peak-timer though itd also close a night memorably while psycatrons is a gentle builder with plenty of reward for those with patience
is the grouping of likeminded producers djs and musicians with the expressed goal of influencing us through sound and so far over the last 12 months they have lived up to that vision putting out exciting music from names such as feralcode jacob todd deep mariano and their current release bringing the dawn from the tag team of label bosses michael lanning and chris conner aka brahma which also got the once over from micah comes as their 16th instalment a track that originally came about as the result of a free sample pack being made available to download from their website made one of the earliest submissions which immediately drew attention and here we see a newly refreshed take from the spanish duo packing some serious broken grooves from the start a chunky mix of breaks lay down a forceful rhythm while delayed vocal samples and breathy sounds lead into a murmuring bassline before dropping back with the addition of sublime chords and development of the vocal while this goes on dreamy melodies hit off each other creating an organic flow throughout with some help from a sublime riff the production is crisp and neat conveying the growing ablities of this teaming of daniel ferreira and jorge garc a the retake comes in the form of a darioef remix notching up the pace to something bordering on trance but without a trace of cheese parts of the original melodies are reworked around a pounding mix of druggy bassline and beats keeping it at peaktime with a breakdown that first takes it right down before blossoming out once more quite tasty
electronic music has always had its murkier corners but the fog seems to have settled particularly thickly late peering through the gloom you glimpse the likes demdike stare and haxan cloak shaping music as unnerving as the occult tales from which they take their names meanwhile industrial techno acts like forward strategy group and karenn sound as caked in soot as the dark mills their music evokes res been some speculation over violesthapeds exact identiy the duo consists berlin-based producer shapednoise and a supposedly well-known techno artist behind the mask but if your only clue were the eight tracks on this debut you might think these were forgotten tapes from an early industrial band like cabaret voltaire its as cold and dank as a dungeon throughout ominous opener of fers a brief chance to catch your breath before the relentless march begins with the shuddering metallic stomp will not of is as dense and threatening as a forest barbed wire and the howls throughout make you picture someone nailing sheets metal over the mouth hell its tempting to try and find an angle to explain music this impenetrable you could say for instance that dramatise dehumanisation as effectively as the zombie films they cite as inspirations but its hard to keep your train thought when your brain when it feels like its being crushed in a vice most dance floor-friendly track here is but even this one feels gungy and fetid regulation could almost be ninja tunes lorn slightly sped up album ends with anaesthesia a beatless track shrouded in sinister hisses that feel like sweat prickling on your brow a sensation which even after just 40 minutes might be more down to exhaustion than fear
for all the subtle changes hes undergone over the years (the lovesick swoon of heartbreaker the glitzy disco of wish you were here his more pointed recent work for numbers) has always aimed straight for the dance floor so when the uk producer dropped t did not feel right on crazylegs earlier this year it sounded like his priorities had changed sure the tracks sappy vocal sample was a throwback to his classic fireworks but where hed usually slide in a 2-step beat or a broken drum pattern he just let the track bask in its own misery while considerably more upbeat his debut for takes the freeform approach of t did not feel right as a jumping off point for what ends up being s best ep since 2011 s music has never existed in a vacuum hes always borrowed ideas from the uk scene around him and re-jigged them to fit his sleek template is no different taking notes from the current crop of grime producers the new age leanings of yamaneko who released on on last year are an obvious reference point particularly on closer me with its slow-motion tidal wave the elegant taps into video game nostalgia and the gossamer brings things down to a whisper even the more rhythmic tunes feel toned-down is the most percussive of them all yet it holds back and lets off bursts of snares and hi-hats that sound like a rifleman picking off targets is built with stained-glass chords that feel so delicate they could shatter at the slightest knock and is an arresting lullaby that hearkens back to s early days of 2009 ts jojo sample wafts over a chunky bassline in a wonderful harmony of the fast and the slow like the crazylegs release magic shows letting his gift for earwormy hooks float free unencumbered by the quantized grid of dance music he sounds refreshed for it

somehow both murky-and-weird and clarion-clear at the same time for the does as well by the lineage of classic chicago house as could reasonably be hoped for enough that its status as a sort of latter-day anthem has been firmly established since it first came out in 2009 so what might be new to hear in it here in a new batch of mixes put out in advance of an zari iii album due in ugust more latter-day-ness for starters dub version by zari iii themselves doesnt do much more than streamline the original losing some of its bouncy sumptuousness in the process but the rest fan out in intriguing fashion jamie s remix finds a fat deep house groove and pretty much just keeps pressing down on it until it starts to fizz all the while spacing the vocals out in a way that sounds natural and more haunting than in the original rt s mix leans back and chills in a seemingly slightly contemplative mood with some squinting-strobe sounds that start to do strange things after repeating a whole bunch of times guy s remix goes big on the latter (meaning night ) with a serious increase in speed thwacking clacking techno drive most intriguing of all in part for the way it diverges from form is a hazy dazed quasi-dubstep mix by glasgow-based sei who wipes almost everything in the original away but evokes it all just the same
the capoeria twins are made up of ian stratford and tim hancock a duo who have been playing at one of the midlands longest running club nights stump juice early releases for the twins included pig lick which was picked up by john stapleton for inclusion on dope on plastic 5 and the club smash 4x3 which is probably their best known track again picked up by john stapleton for release on his blowpop label and becoming one of the favourite picks on dope on plastic 7 a certain mr scruff provided a remix to 4x3 making the 12 a much sought after piece of black plastic - possibly a place that is of special interest to the twins - is the name of their new album showcasing a variety of sounds including breakbeat drumnbass and house riding on a heavy nu-skool breaks vibe motherless sounds more like the track that general midi would have created to open up his artist album deep rumbling bass lines and nu-skool breaks style stabs accompany the vocalist similar to t-power and amazirees runnin from a few years back flick the switch continues the nu-skool flavour on the cd this time its a dirtier dubbier approach to breaks and bass with diva-esque vocals that get passed through a filter for some great effects its the second single to be lifted from the album and contains the club smash 4x3 manuela upps the tempo to create a subtle drumnbass affair using deep dubby bass jazzy drum techniques and r b style male vocals 4x3 is the track which brought the twins to prominence receiving support from djs and clubbers alike with its combination of scatty jazz vocals (no its not sampled) jump-up bass and horn stabs revisits the nu-skool breaks vibe on vanish this time around its a deeper affair with techy bass lines and vocals riding on urban stylings two chevrons apart takes the album to the house with its 4/4 beats and jazzy vocals the swinging lose control features helen marcia mcdonald on vocals for a little cocktail lounge music while the twins get accompany her with jazzy piano loops driving drum beats and funky jazz bass finally the album closes off with the downtempo with its moody dubby vibes hip hop style beats backed up with lots of percussion elements not too sure exactly where is located or if it is actually a place but one thing is for sure if it is a real suburb it celebrates a wide variety of music styles with breakbeat drumnbass hip hop house with heavy influences of jazz ragga and soul all laced throughout

perhaps hes snacked on something thats upset his usually chirpy demeanour an undercooked potato or something but dan pearce shows his swarthier side on his latest ep for catz n dogz ever-reliable thats not to say that s all-court game encompassing attention-grabbing basslines snappy house grooves and ravey attitude has been kicked to the sidelines just that is his deepest project to date barrelling reverb-heavy bassline and angry whistling synths stride across it joined by a plonking g-funk-style keyboard motif with added bite if you will in case you werent already convinced of his versatility then takes a nostalgic trip back to his hardcore and drum bass formative years on kicking off with galloping congas pearce then gaffa-tapes gut-bothering sub-bass to it followed by layers of muted cut-up rave horns military breakbeats and cosmic pulses the good news is that such has been his meteoric rise weve probably only scratched the surface with this fella
techno could really be enlivened i feel by a hip-hop-style beef tradition where criticizing another producer s style would result in a return volley of disses and zings imagine the thrill of dancing with abandon to the sound of jay haze and mathew jonson trading insults about each others mothers and use of ableton presets i know that s how i want to spend my saturdays irony aside is a real return to form from closer musik s despite his dubious decision to write lyrics criticizing minimal techno for having no groove no balls the original is a lopsided latin percussion jam that comes across a bit like ricardo villalobos remixed for strip clubs the chanted lyrics and sleazy little guitar licks combine with an ominous double string stab at the start of every bar to create the kind of track that brings out the actor in every dancer there s a lot of space in the groove to move around in and the tempo is lazy making this less suited to straight-up techno or house crowds but open-minded audiences will lap it up fortunately have also provided the marcus mix here which speeds up the original and adds a stronger kick were i uncharitable i d say that this destroys the point of the song but the nice thing to say is that this makes it more accessible so lets leave it at that unsurprisingly dj gives us a surprising new direction for the song on his remix which may well be the big hit on this release focusing on the guitar lick he reimagines as gently swelling disco reminiscent of modjo s lady but without the filters (of his recent work it s probably closest to the elementary lover remix) this track has that iron fist in a velvet glove thing going on the sounds and style are smooth but with a restrained power and a constant escalation of tension that s likely to end up with people being surprised at how hard they ve been dancing there s strong crossover potential in this mix and remarkably the treatment of the vocals makes the lyrics sound like an appeal to the possibilities inherent in dance music rather than a criticism of its weaker moments a trick that all of us critics could probably learn a lot from
there are a couple of videos of andreas tilliander on youtube that show him jamming in the studio you dont see much of the man just a skinny tattooed arm here and there as he tweaks a knob or pushes a button the lights blink back in strange patterns as the music gradually develops seemingly from nowhere while the music accompanying the videos is simpler than anything found on it nonetheless gives you a good idea of how it was probably made the album and tillianders videos suggest the work of an artist who is not so much a composer but a shepherd the music is allowed to wander and graze within the confines of its field not controlled by idea or direction but a simple desire to find fresh pasture what green grass is there still to find in dub techno quite a lot judging by the results this is partly down to tiliander letting the music choose its own path and partly for arriving at it from a more ambient and avant-garde perspective brendon moeller also found the pickings rich on his recent subterranean album but where subterranean feels like dub techno trying to fight its way out of an ambient tractor beam without resorting to beats is a more wistful stirring at the uncharted periphery beats are present like on the most conventional track but the main reference point is dub technos more mutant offspring such as vladislav delays multila or rhythm and sounds lengthy track imprint there are no melodies no patterns not even real repetitions the music merely evolves flowing freely from form to form being the longest track at a healthy 12 minutes in particular impresses for its capacity to constantly find a new face its rough and mechanical coda betrays the runs of echoing chords at the opening and the long drenched reams of sound that stretch out the middle passage but even if the forms are organic the atmosphere is less bucolic almost every track feels clotted with pollution and the groaning weight of factory landscapes even as you listen for the umpteenth time however its still hard to predict where these songs are going there are simply too many changes and mood swings along the way for example seems most human at first starting like a forlorn call for help with echoes of distorted am radio and pulverised classical music but the call is never answered by the arriving machines that usher in an abrupt silence while feeds heavily in the confines of dub technos field it never feels limited or bound to it the result is a collection of textures dark futuristic moods and unstructured sound forms that is difficult to grasp but all the richer for it
boutade was famously declared the greatest dance record of the 00s by bill brewster but its creator mugwump has been pretty quiet since the end of that decade his fledgling label which issued its first ep in september was a low-key return for the formerly prolific belgian but his music isnt immediately striking its subtle and tends to sneak up on you a collaboration with dc salas bears mugwumps hallmark for charismatic dexterity buffing these jog-paced tracks with strains of acid house new beat and ebm smoulders with an understated intensity like a scowl across a crowded room its burly bassline seems to slowly cook the rest of the track the wailing horn that pierces is the most arid instrument in a landscape of dry sounds including some dusty snares and breaking glass the soft remix of inserts a thin acid line and some snare fills while dialling down the tension both are excellent; youd bet your house on finding either version on an andrew weatherall mix at some point in the next few months recalls nitzer ebb with its choleric grunts and steely synths but its far from stiff other sounds drift and click in the background coming into focus as the track progresses cumulatively this gives a more easy-going groove than its ebm inspiration would otherwise allow which reflects the eps suppleness
since he and machinedrum launched ultramajic in 2013 s music has sharpened from loose playful funk to incisive techno that leans on repetition more than melody focus on straightforward club sounds has made him a better and his label mates have provided him with an arsenal of new tunes thats what is all about a nearly comprehensive look at s current musical universe its made up mostly of ultramajic releases and outlines the borders of that sound hes created: skeletal twitchy and brittle in the flesh he mixes these tracks like a madman funnelling the repetition into an exhilarating barrage on disc however it feels a little too streamlined s selections have a lot of space and they tend to fit together like jigsaw pieces smoothly trading one minimalist hook for another s so uniform that each small change feels massive airy bassline in s clever mashup of s with s is one such moment and it works like a gust of wind thrusting the mix forward methodically piles on the tracks from there slowly notching up the energy before letting it plateau halfway through with after that settles into a casual trot that doesnt pick up until two of tracks close the mix while shows off some new tracks here among them the stellar collaboration and the stuttering the real star is an unknowable entity according to the label (though in terms of style he might as well be an alter ego of s) what makes the tracks stand out is how they happily recycle clich s taking infectious vocal samples and structuring hard club bangers around them yre so well built take a second to admire the bendy synths of that they transcend their own well worn tropes and the celebratory divas are a foil for the monotony of s robovoices every time a track comes in perks up providing the most exciting peaks on a mix that otherwise stays flat and safe

opening of is a perfect analog for s latest record: a minute-long whorl of luminous synth layers disappears into thin air replaced in seconds by a booming punchy 4/4 eventually those melodic figures return to waft around the heavy churn joined by an uplifting arpeggio harmony but they dont carry the same dramatic potential as when kennedy left them alone his shuddering rhythms can give purpose as much as stifle possibility in that way has trouble making its domineering beats and brilliant melodies work together as a compelling whole even as it delivers sturdy techno fare in the process kennedy is at his best when juggling just a few ideas all 808 momentum and chilly dissonance is a fine example of that as is the rugged otherworldly stomp of latter track has no qualms reimagining early autechres industrial-tinged idm as formidable dance music with an unsettling sci-fi glint and is the highlight for it on the other hand starts out simply enough with glacial tones moving loosely around a straight kick pattern but kennedy soon pours on high-definition flourishes to little effect every drum and synth on is too well-crafted to not pique the interest of any techno head in earshot so its hard not to wonder how strong the ep could have been with more attention to cohesive arrangements
well i wont bore you with the history of sasha in the end it s his godfather of prog status that people are interested in and in terms of production it s a reputation built of course on charlie may co-productions the duo got back together again recently for which has melody in its riff and a certain atmospheric quality but it fails miserably to match their previous accolades or to develop another sound the track will immediately remind fans of sasha s irdrawndagger days but sadly it also reiterates the idea that the progressive house scene has now gone totally stale fortunately it is sasha prot g james who drags the track kicking and screaming up to date with his remix obviously played one too many video games as a youngster as the remix twitches like a wonky nintendo before the beauty of the original melodic riff returns to masterful effect the electro tag has become an extremely dirty one in underground circles nevertheless this mix is squelchy electro breaks done with style and verve have the roles of the master and the sidekick now been reversed
s second 12-inch for berlin-based sees him continue his experiments with ethnic sounds and shaping them into dance floor-ready loops 3000 combines busy percussion and throbbing bass and makes them work away ceaselessly yet powerful as such loop-based constructions can be sometimes theyre also hard to make blossom the pot-and-pan clang of aint too bad for example and the stabby bassline which joins it is unarguably impelling but from here it seems as if 3000 runs out of places to go a feeling not helped by his use of martin luther king vocal samples rcadia shakes along with a latino bent this time 3000 gives himself more to work with splicing in jittery pounding chords that sound as much percussive as melodic perhaps a hangover from his days in detroit far from the gold-tinged beauty he wrought for last years hotel oasiz however they sound rough and hurried its almost hard to believe the two sequences were created by the same producer but then perhaps thats the tyranny of busy loops which can eat up a tracks workable space dapayks remix sidesteps this pitfall playing deftly with percussion rather than trying to add to it even so his slappy claps and keening hats only manage to do so much with the densely-packed clamour of the original
on his first ep for belgiums label takes an unexpected foray into deep ha i almost had you there fear not: stroboscopic artefacts regular remains as committed as ever to dark churning techno what separates his work apart from so much grey-scale fetishism is his unconventional rhythmic approach res nary a four-to-the-floor kick to be found on any of these tracks which instead favor galloping sometimes bewildering cadences where he comes close to a straight-four beat as on the he deftly accents the downbeats to knock the groove off balance on l the snare provides the steady pulse while kick drums and metallic accents explode like shrapnel around it where l and especially are too brutal to make much sense outside of a club the opening is essentially an ambient track albeit one with a shuddering 128 bpm pulse of resonant low toms tension between the luminous pads and the contorted distorted drums feels like a riddle to be solved pulling you deeper with every elliptical cycle

many of you would have heard this track on nick warrens latest global underground cd and many of you will remember istanbuls (aka cervus) from his amazing productions 4 days and confide in me strawberry fields begins with a twisted synth tough kick and minimal percussion waves of melody steal in and out of the track as floating pads fill the room more intricate percussion is introduced when melody key changes and a chugging synthline bring us to the breakdown the captivating melody is given full attention the chugging synth is brought back then the beat a bassline groove holds us until uplifting pads and spacey hits complete this beautifully complicated track the max graham mix uses many of the same elements as the original but has more of a big room club feel to it maxs trademark hypnotic percussion and bassline energy introduce the track the melodic waves of the orginal are interupted by a dirty off key synth as uplifting pads and a trancey synthline give the track its big room appeal the chugging synth leads to the breakdown where melancholy pads stand out until all the elements are brought back to great effect yet another double a-side from
tobias pedersons best known track is drum bass stunner syncopy on te l records one that had none of the usual taut and tough hallmarks of the genre here on his first release on copenhagen label surfase he pulls the same rabbit out of his hat listening with an admittedly half-attentive ear on the first go i didnt even realize these tracks were at 170 pm tempo s drums are padded and pithy meted out with just a slight bit of syncopation so they sound more like earthy deep house than drum bass throw in darting 80s pop-calibre basslines and cheap keyboard synths and youve got yourself an animal thats every bit as unique (if not as stirring) as his debut syncopy is even more of a casio jam an emaciated power ballad full of creeping chords grotty synth bass and slamming squalls of fluid synth this ones given a determined lurch and pronounced echoed snare hits that fall out of the end of each bar removing it even further from your typical drum bass roller here easties found a way to remove both the common structural and textural aspects of the formula-dogged genre and create something that sounds genuinely new at this point all they need is a little more force and momentum
from claudja arry to sue o latino to panda ear countless artists over the decades have used their music to summon lush tropical atmospheres these days few do it better than henning severud the norwegian producer known as the ocean called his 2014 ep on was one of the finest examples of balmy house in recent memory (made all the better by the sly seinfeld reference in its title) last year he explored the sound further on his debut album vibe telemetry now call and dj urger two artists with their own brands of balearic flair rework albums last track on a remix ep for call s remix might be the most euphoric track hes ever done with splashy snares and soaring keys floating in a mirage of bird calls and misty pads in this breezy atmosphere the skipping rhythm and uplifting bassline call to mind the pleasure of stepping off a plane into perfect weather dj urger stretches out a bit much as he did on last septembers remix for club no-no urgers nderstated is 15 minutes long and seemingly improvised but far more grounded than that might sound this is straightforward disco house with strutting drums a thick bassline and reams of bongos urger keeps things fresh by changing the arrangements over time tweaking the melodic hook swapping out the old drum loops for new ones (like the breaky number that comes in about halfway through) each remix carries the distinctive style of its artist but both deliver sun-kissed rhythms perfectly suited to the warm months ahead
rarely do you see a release get dj feedback that mentions disco the simply titled imprint has been an outlet for the uk producer and others who share his uncompromising techno vision since 2004 that sound however has evolved over the years so much so that s remit includes room for artists like who inspire such strange responses you cant blame jocks for being a bit confused by the collection of tracks from the young greek producer have a lightness to them on thats down to the lady imploring you to work your body she makes these commands over an achingly slow beat and a squirming bassline its exactly as the aforementioned feedback describes some sort of unholy union of industrial techno and funky disco is this the revival of belgian new beat that (almost) no one has been waiting for probably not if the rest of the ep is any indication that doesnt mean hes not able to come up with some inspired combinations though the title track would be straight industrial if it werent for the cinematic strings that fly in straight from a john williams score late in the game and s orchestral undercurrent simply serves as another shade of black in an already colorless and lumbering 122 bpm track only really fails to inspire despite its breakbeat percussion serving to break up the monotonous crunch elsewhere though you can tell that is up to something rather fascinating what its called is an open question what it may become is a tantalizing one

t didnt take many solo releases for to establish his name firmly on the scene his studio skills and musicality are undeniable showcased in numerous hits that grab your hips as well as your head then again his cv was impressive beforehand featuring behind-the-scenes collaborative efforts with names like loco dice and timo maas and producing pop for the likes of the sugababes despite all of this though his latest release on cocoon while expertly crafted lacks the catchiness and the indescribable spark of some of his other work oth and gain are built upon around such similar ingredients that you might think these are uttrichs musings on losing his pocketbook twice n a way both tracks seem like a lighter more upbeat take on last years hunter theyre certainly more rooted in european minimalism than the detroit-esque sounds of tracks like full clip and stoned utopilot starts with a thumping beat and playful woodblock hits around which an arpeggiated and funky synth line is woven and simple but effective bassline trots on underneath n understated breakdown shows uttrichs eye for detail and when the bassline sneaks its way back into the track you have to admire the arrangement skills gain works in the same way here we find a techier synth riff that plays subtle tricks throughout the track with a similar bassline the way the two interact are from the same playbook as this 12-inch is a fine release but not uttrichs best by a long shot oth tracks will work on a dance floor being based on a tried-and-tested formula but they suffer for their similarity and despite the funky bassline and swirling synths arent memorable enough to achieve the earworm status of uttrichs better releases
presk and felix lenferink are two amsterdam producers whose breezy house and garage-leaning productions have often favoured finicky detail over substance with their will ink label they seek to redress the balance turning their talents to no-frills loop techno though their fixation on swing and micro-groove remains intact the labels fourth release is its first from a non-founder the unknown it doesnt deviate too much from the established will ink formula but it might be the best instance of it yet as with other parts of the will ink catalogue the gritty breakbeat derivations and whipcrack chord work of shed loom large over much of the ep in opener clattering breaks and tart synths scud gracefully across the beat on the highlight the syncopations reach deeper infecting the kick such that the whole groove flexes and bends like a piece of elastic the blueprint is clearly parts of the wax or eqd series but hall subtly rebalances the elements so that they register less as propulsive skip than as beatdown halftime throw in some nifty delay-fogged breakdowns and jobs a goodun by comparison s emaciated dub texturing seems a little reserved but give it time and its vacuum cleaner wiggle will work its steady way into the hips
deep dish remake a classic featuring stevie nicks already big across the billboard charts this track will continue to push the duo s george is on album to greater heights remixes come courtesy of axwell tocadisco and miami calling the club mix is a straight up slow burner that features the nice reworking of the original melody and showcases stevie throughout the breakdowns are rather effective with the mellow melody taking over though the subtle beat and simple percussion keep the track rolling moving onto the dub mix we see a lot of the same elements from the club mix make an appearance though numerous vocal samples are given the effects treatment the reworked original melody is still the main focus here while a stronger bassline assists axwell steps up next for his take and straight away lets loose with the vocal alongside stripped back beats and snares as the track builds quickly axwell s inclusion of his interpreted melody is a high and lofty affair as it bounces tightly with striking high-end basslines and sustained strings the miami calling remix is up next and keeps the tempo upbeat with loads of percussive elements but it s the addition of an organic guitar melody throughout which definitely offers the most distinction the twanging bassline and pulsating synths play along with the vocal that add more of a bouncy feeling throughout ending this package is tocadisco with remix featuring live guitar samples and percussion than the other releases but it quickly shadowed by the change in beat as a solid bass drum is introduced with infectious guitar riffs and synth hooks all mixes ultilise the original elements of the song nicely and the melody reworkings are something to appreciate
her blurry pictures s second solo album was a little slapdash thrown together from tunes throughout his career it was an slightly uninspiring listen but proves it could be catnip to a good remixer with this new package level the lps opener was one of its best a sterling cut with a rippling synth lead dixon throws a simple house beat on top and keeps that lead glimmering in the sidelines for a percolating eight-minute workout its a light re-rub but effective nonetheless capable remixers tale transform the listless into a heady trip flush with ping-ponging synth lines its a rework the original never even hinted at finally kufen takes on the jaunty immediately burying it in filtered fuzz and vamping over the top with sprightly keyboards finished off with buoyant chords that seem to bounce off the low-end its an immaculately textured version that recalls the virtuosic horror c album from earlier this year
following up his second release for moneyshot germanys has certainly been making headway into the breakbeat scene with luminaries such as meat katie name checking him as one of the leading lights in the future of the scene not to mention signing him to lot49 for gateway/soulsearcher follows up his party rocking supa (which was done with deckart) with a much deeper and percussive representing on the remix tip are superstyledeluxe who are certainly making their payback felt with releases on supercharged and their own payback project side a original features trademark style drum beats however hes added a slightly different shuffle to the beats giving it that broom sweep feel progressively elements such as a deep droning electro bassline subtle bongo riff turntable scratches and a buzzing synth hook make their prescence felt in the tune ploddy slightly heavy definitely and its certainly something different from what weve heard from moneyshot side b superstyledeluxe remix upon hearing that superstyledeluxe were doing the remix it came to mind that one should expect something completely different as the ssd boys are known to conjure up something extraordinary with their electro-funk-disco-b-boy-breakbeat sound the tune opens up with a slightly different take on the original breakbeat with that all too prominent ssd style hi-hat rhythm and some hard hitting horn stabs beefing up the intro thats not all that gets beefed up though as ssd drop their trademark warbling bassline and breakbeat rhythms into the mix to give the remix a full yet disjointed sound sure it can throw you offbeat but that big and original sound just has to be appreciated
no matter how you look at it s has a lot to live up to the involvement of daniel lopatin aka was enough to inflate expectations but in some sense it also felt like this album would be an important statement for the future of footwork as a whole s the first full-length of all new material to appear on the crews eponymous label following only a collection of archive material from the late rashad indeed has a confidently evolved sound you can tell its a footwork album just from the track titles and much of it sticks to what might be called the conventions of the scene opening track is a typically frenetic number filled with g-funk synths and chopped vocal samples about smoking weed a is an all out kick drum assault typical of the genre but theres a noticeable difference here: an undeniable sheen and depth to the sound especially when compared to the rough-and-ready often claustrophobic mastering of earlier footwork records this seems indicative of lopatins involvement hes credited explicitly as a contributor on three tracks ( lets ) and he mixed the album but its hard to tell where his contribution begins and ends and to the albums benefit lopatin seems present in the overflowing synths like the distorted chords in the bubbling lead in a or the levon vincent-esque dubby pads that drive those elements are crystal clear at once experimental and almost comforting but is first and foremost party music the tense samples of might seem alienating but theyll surely destroy on the right dance floor as would the ravey synths in is an exercise in half-step like something one of the many footwork-influenced uk producers would do which combines with subtle cut-up breaks lets though will get any party started on the album highlight jazzy chords and horns pair with a classic vocal and zippy 4/4 beat beautifully encapsulating the history of footworks evolution from chicago house
aka chonga has had considerable success with releases gracing labels such as saw recordings and sumsonic/mechanism now he gets the chance to release under deep dishs and boy has he been working hard soul doing dishes is a quirky and dubby affair with lots of echoing effects vibrating guitar pluckiness and engaging percussion listening is the essence here as there is a lot on offer for deeper house fans that don t mind a bit of dub the variations of sounds flowing through this track keep you guessing as originality shines soul doing dishes (luke fair mix) mr luke fair get his hands on soul doing dishes and provides a refreshing uptake of the original the bass has more of an edge but is smoothed over by well-constructed chords played through a variety of light organ sounds assisting the melody is the rasping and grinding of percussive elements while the breakdown brings in the smooth dubby baseline altogether is an outstanding mix silver man tango is anything but bright shutting the doors and pulling the blinds as this track clouds your mind with emotional sullen synths accompanied by chilling vocals in this progressive wonder silver man tango (envys galactic lunatic mix) envy s skills in the remix department really shine through here with a quality driving mix that leads on directly from the original it s gets tougher with tormenting melodies and a more prominent vocal throughout making me loose my mind is the name of the game here as the vocal states quality
veteran uk producer kirk giorgio is heading back to with a new album project called sambatek according to the label it will see him apply his techno sound to classic samba drum breaks and organic percussive elements ahead of the lp which is slated for release later in the year we get the first of two advance remix eps rick offers two reinterpretations of both of which are more reduced than his usual fare djs will opt for the remix: atop a kick and pulsing bassline there are dubbed-out chords jittery hi-hats and a single echoed twang all of which shift in and out of the mix without much fuss the dub takes away the kick relying instead on the bassline for propulsion and adds some gritty textures with the chords occasionally flying loose nx1s remix shows off their assertive atmospheric techno style for me its easily the records standout a dense chunk of machine funk that should slot right into harder-edged sets spatial continues his shift from high-tempo dubstep to slower house and techno the transition has yielded mixed results on occasion as evidenced by this remix of da all in all though its a decent package that should help build some buzz before the sambatek full-length
what began as a stealthy reinvention of electronic music during the early 90s has over the past few years become a ubiquitous sound signature in contemporary techno thats right basic channel-inspired layered tracks are every bit as prevalent now as stripped back fx-heavy minimal tracks however just like the much-maligned mnml most producers trying to recreate the scuffled smacked out sounds of maurizio usually end up coming across as two-dimensional and flat rather than providing a new lead for the kingston-berlin continuum on the latest at least attempts something more adventurous than the standard lumbering dub; the title track is a glitchy beatless soundtrack its gradually unfolding vaguely menacing textures sounding more like an outtake from an snd session fused with the static distortion of a throbbing gristle happening of however is more in keeping with the penchant for languid dubby tracks yet there is something intangibly chilling and mysterious amid its textured rhythms that make it worth listening to similarly features rich piano keys adding a ponderous melancholic feeling to what would otherwise be a sluggish groove res no doubt though that label boss eliott provides the highlight on this release with a remix of of revolving around a housey groove shaking organic percussion and a series of smart drops manages to make s reverberating textures sound rough around the edges spitting out raw analogue shards its the grittiest track on and the one that really provides an indicator as to where dub techno might head to next
israeli producer like his good friend shlomi aber makes techno that leans heavy on minimal but melody and bouncy basslines ensure that the dance floor is kept in view at all times his first ep for ovum in five years is full of treacly techno grooves breezes past with soft wooshing synths snares that lag just off the beat and a beautifully elastic bassline taking time out for the most understated of breakdowns the bassline that sagi concocts on is even more moreish springy and rich-sounding underpinning a dubby pulse and discofied claps then sagi turns things on its head with weirding the listener out with a childlike single-note refrain random spraycan bursts and spluttering hi-hats it tops off an ep where light lives comfortably with shade

while techno seems to have been the word on the street over the past year or so the level to which this techno has rang true is dubious with so much weak uprooted music around being labelled as such there are only a few places you can go to hear the truly vibrant interesting and powerful tunes one artist that has rarely not brought the goods is following his release under the o/v/r guise with karl oconnor ruskin returns on his own here with two cuts of solid dark techno purism may not carry such abrasive vibes as the o/v/r work or previous blueprint releases but it maintains all the underground edge energy and creativity ruskin is renowned for brings the gentle hovering of a light sabre and tangled electrified communications panning around your head the start to the track is dark really dark after a couple of minutes the sub-driven kick is introduced and the tangled sound slowly starts to form patterns shortly after his subtle hats enter the frame ruskin gives us a minute of a respite further tangling the sound and when the kick is reintroduced its defined and the groove has an even deeper swing the way ruskin uses the metallic tangled sounds to create and push the arrangement gives edge and menace while balancing the track perfectly on the b gets straight down to business with the heavy sub kick creating a steady wall of sound as the atmospheric elements are gradually painted in the landscape is the same distant and unfamiliar territories but the emphasis here is firmly in the groove comes alive late when ruskin strips the channels and launches into pure techno mode its hard to imagine youll be hearing this at any old club any time soon youll most likely have to wait for those rare occasions when a techno master such as ruskin hood or simms comes to a club near you in the wrong hands or on the wrong sound system this kind of music is wasted
is two men from sunny florida who make spaced out techy gems fredrick gablemann and drew whitehead turn out a monster that has been receiving plays from sean cusick lee burridge and jimmy van m is a very minimal tune but still thick with bass and lovely sounds the original mix starts out with a nice sweepy synth and a breaky intro and then straight on into the beats they are metallic and thick but very sparse claps follow in and an arpeggiated sound floats in over the top lots of effects like swishes gating and chopping sounds add layers of depth a voice sample comes in; it s light and sexy the bassline is funky but subdued and a very warm sound low creepy tones set in for the melody and goes well into the end the original has a very techy light vibe with a groovy bassline precision is the amazing gab oliver kaybee from zero tolerance dishing up the goods on this remix the precision mix is a bit more minimal and trippy the vocal is cut up and warbles along more in the song the drum sounds are very industrial sounding which seems like they were created in a mill steam sounds as if it s being let off as the claps come in a slow introduction takes us into a fierce pulsing bassline as sounds layer over top in a different tone then the original we drop into a chugging bit with weird alarm sounds with an evil edge this is a very dark and omniscient tune this is a really nice song with its layers and so much focus on the bassline featuring a very good remix by gab and kaycee and an outstanding tune for the original is featured on sound bytes 17 if you would like to get a taster of what it sounds like
like so many of his countrymen paris is fond of squelch and buzz combining sinister techno and impish electro over punky disco rhythms on his recent singles for he has both refined and complicated his sound tightening up his grooves while amplifying his sonic horizons with volatile analog tones reminiscent of luke abbotts burbling modular synths sounds even more confident with driving arpeggios offset by a bit of dem bow swagger in the snares and fierce chants punctuating floaty choral passages with its tense tribal impulse feels a lot like uk funky; its also faintly reminiscent of olof dreiers emmanuel jal remix on innervisions in addition to the full version and a meat-and-potatoes edit there are two remixes argy gives the song a pinging techno rework while dj subtracts the overt africanisms and focuses on a cool stepping groove the first suggests objektivity the latter rush hour s egoes and brioskis remix of the same are darker and danker with a creepy clanking vibe endemic to paris goth-enamored club music call it catacombs techno
is the third release under s birth name since shifting away from his abdulla rashim alias after a dungeon synth lp and a heavy techno album its the first release that feels like a direct continuation of where he left off as rashim linell drops the atmospherics for the title track and focuses on the mid-range chords are springy and textured with ripples that give the track a curious (and irresistible) sense of momentum among most functional techno bangers the ice-cold offers less in the way of melody and ambiance that leaves which sits somewhere between the other two tracks it starts as another straight-ahead banger but takes an unexpected turn the lead becoming bubbly as if submerged underwater track is then swaddled in a fog of synths that recalls the chilly atmospheres of pivotal releases
italian based producer alessandro russo aka teams up with french vocalist eric pasquereau to deliver this latest release on us based is the track and it is another gritty outfit from saw the club mix is quite a gritty and dark affair flowing with some tough edged synth patterns as well as a nice smooth set of vocals the drums are pretty standard flowing at a good and constant pace and the track is made even better thanks to some good effects and melodic tones the intrumental has all the grit and drive of the club mix without the vocals essentially relying on its driving sounds and effects but for me it really lacks an edge that the vocal mix has the original dowtempo mix is quite smooth and seductive flowing with some pretty slowed beats and the main vocals it features quite a tasty breakdown midway in seeing the vocals go solo alongside a smooth set of strings and atmospheric elements the mix is a good edition to a pretty solid release from saw a release that will see the club mix take a lot of the focus one would feel
that stands for out of body experience had one of the most unusual releases on opal tapes of last year with sftcr the brief but arresting album traded the labels crumbling house and hissing drones for big cresting waves of sound that hid big-room melodies beneath all the fuzz now with a release on another ascendant tape label collection yari malaspina lets those melodies take centre stage and rockets himself to new cosmic heights the opening minutes of leaves you feeling adrift: the melodies are viscous and when there are rhythms theyre almost never propulsive theres an obvious debt to actress on the rough frequencies of 166 166 166 (which sound like they were scrubbed with a nail file) and on the submerged disco of but usually embellishes that blueprint rather than just copying it much of has a space-age sense of wonder and possibility: the intertwining synths of feel like they go on forever somewhere between some lost german synth record a low-budget sci-fi film score and a mid-90s progressive house interlude its in the final section of that malaspina really proves his growth as a producer takes a synth motif as overdriven and ridiculous as any trance anthem and forces it to merely billow in suspension on he lets big surges of melody crash and ebb into near-silence underlining the desolate atmosphere that haunts the whole album both tracks smudge familiar sounds until theyre nearly unrecognizable which is a signature of malaspinas method he doesnt so much deconstruct genres as implode them and work with the wreckage

despite having never officially collaborated marcel dettmann and rene pawlowitz k shed have been an informal duo for years exchanging feedback and club testing each others tracks the two producers have a symbiotic relationship rooted in their shared love for raw techno s shed and dettmann indulge their purist impulses more than ever before creating what is probably the most brutal record in either producers catalogue the first two tracks of ep play out like a musical interpretation of kafkas in the penal colony and are seriously ruthless peak time tracks made up of harsh industrial noises like churning gears and sucking valves is just a tad less intense with almost-funky rhythm changes and a single repeating chord that makes it s most musical offering unlike the first two tracks this one might actually work on a dance floor unadorned with broken glass and leather daddies ll three are decidedly more catastrophic than usual and undeniable examples of what shed would call true techno music

not not funs amanda brown insists she saves the straight-up dance music for her 100 silk sublabel but the first widely-released record by tokyos seems to have fallen through the cracks not that it really matters her style of introspective downer house is hardly the kind of thing youd want airbrushed for the dance floor trades in slinky drifting mood music smothering dance motifs in waves of vocal echo and synth smudge is a fluid effort and hardly top-heavy but its most successful moments come early on the urgent rhythm on is calmed by spectral wordless coos and delicate piano stabs and reminds of terekkes l i e s release countering a low-slung bassline with soft luminous chords and a twinkling melody later pairs a similar ambience with machine sputters and an arpeggiated bassline and the stoned cyclical chants on come across like a sultrier less sociable la vampires
recent years have seen use his label to experiment with a variety of warped club music last year he appeared with theo parrish and duminie deporres on warrior code a sharp piece of broken beat on sound signature he continues in this vein on the ep the record is indebted to the yoruba god of thunder dance and the drum whose associated music obryant says helped give his ancestors a sense of who they were and where they were originally from he harnesses these sounds on the title track a searing tribal roller that features acoustic percussion thick on polyrhythmic texture its mbira loop is light and housey but the booming horns and acidic synth swells give it an intimidating tone they recall pharoahe monch more than say osunlade the other tracks are warmer but no less complex winstons has dense harmony at every turn plus a funky and knobbly bassline while shifts between clunky broken beat and techy detroit house the latter is the work of a musician with a command of deep rhythms

with their limited-run releases taste for grotty reboots of past styles sleeve design indebted to public possession and sex tags and occasional edgy title ( how made my mom sis my sexbot slaves ) its easy to dismiss as a stale infusion of recent trends but the music on the young french label mostly by unknown artists has been ambitious and sophisticated none more so than this debut from which tries out a range of genres and nails it every time s harder tracks catch the attention first on opener dispassionate voices intone poetry over a kick drum and an unsettling high-end squeak so far so drab except the whole thing is smashed so hard into the red that it feels like the airs being crushed out of your lungs closer co-produced with seattles is a scorched breakbeat techno track that speeds along close to 140 bpm ts pummelling breaks and kicks ought to be just as panic-inducing but the atmospherics (clues in the title) give the whole thing a watery bleakness both tracks imply recently popular styles the former cold-wave techno the latter the industrial revival but command their own space the rest of the ep focusses on lush downcast melody is sultry electro its chords clouding richly around the rasping percussion s halftime drums and radiophonic bloops are harder to place and all the more beguiling for it
fter peverelists excellent recent single for s label returns the favour and releases a 12-inch on peverelists label is likely to have draw comparisons to 138 dj zincs drum and bass/garage crossover record from 2000 a cut that more or less kicked off breakstep except its not drum n bass that is melding with garage here--its techno 4/4 kick underpins the tracks sub and atmospherics and there are other signposts too of the tracks techno lineage but somehow i can only call this a track not a song it lacks the emotional punch that tunes of this deep nature need and that is well capable of producing on the other side is much closer to a standard club cut: precise drums are thrown all over the place as the bass stares you down and the instrumentation convinces you of dread its a much more solid affair than the flip and it makes you wish that had pulled something this good out of the bag for a track which could have taken dubstep to new and interesting places
clearly the people at curle like things that build takes till the fourth track of curle 5 the labels rule of fives anniversary compilation to get into unmistakable party mode with the radio edit of (concision does as much for this music as expansiveness does something thats always worth remembering ) strictly rhythm is in this labels dna as much as force tracks or max e s lavish gets a look in on here and its easy to hear in the way harks back to mid 80s pop r b or in the easy synth flurry that makes up the melody of s beltrans se tracks are more than happy to meet the listener halfway i should clarify that the track is number four on curle 5 s first disc second disc is harder to quantify its a data disc featuring a trio of mixes of label highlights from r and esen this is a clever way to present alternate angles on the catalog and if the mixes risk overkill really guys you arent that legendary yet its not hard to hear why curle might be feeling bullish about its short history besides the first unmixed disc really is nicely put together begins slowly and a little tremulously with martyns mix of s (whose pianos really do curl) which melts into whose layers are so wispy they might float away if not for the steady house pulse when comes back in its original mix later its pitch shifted title instruments (or anyway the sound its mean to evoke) are a statement of ethos as much as a track in some way follows tobias s remix of s whose hypnotically splintered synthesizers have as much claim of sounding like acid bells as anything of s some notes on the mixes: is longest (105 minutes) and simmers for quite a while before it starts to bubble esens is shortest (56 minutes) and is darker in tone but light in execution as youd probably figure from him rs (80 minutes) plays with tonal contrasts more than the other two and sounds strongest to me which is fitting considering how versatile curles output has been even only a short time into its existence
starting off your label with a remix from david kennedy (here appearing as pearson ) is an auspicious beginning when its a remix of whose music so wonderfully taps into the house/dubstep crossover theres some future zeitgeist voodoo going on there the danish teal records have done just that and s picks up right where mrs fingers left off grinding on a dusty sampled breakbeat it has a discerning stomp amplified by a sample grinding in rude repetition like stuck gears when the bassline comes in it sounds far-off and aged like it was sampled off some old jazz record indeed the whole thing has an off-kilter feel like it was composed entirely of repeating samples an aesthetic as classicist in its ragged diy nature as undeniably now in its futuristic reutilization of the past david kennedys remix is either really old pearson material or really new: it sounds far off from the nerve-wracked hesitance of his recent productions where drums hit so lightly and frequently it was like they were trying to keep from touching the ground here his drum programming tic is straightened out into something almost straightforward still oddly swung but predictable: it fits well within the originals ethos of banging and backward-looking house the subtle build over eight minutes lightly flecked with muted chords also shows a new restraint on kennedys part: that he can play the chameleon so well is just another obvious exhibition of his considerable talent
ki latvam ki doesnt look much like the prototypical dj/producer with long hair a beard and strikingly unhip clothing he looks every bit the finnish loner that his music makes him out to be his latest 12-inch for should do little to change that perception: its a strange two-tracker that in another world would be called anthemic but in this one merely sounds like a frightening set of tunes fit for chopping off heads and plundering villages its hard not to hear that youll agree when encountering a song entitled the in it invites it ut latvam ki does nothing to discourage it either slowly laying out a steady beat thats surrounded by moody horn swells and swathes of dub clouds it takes nearly three minutes in fact before latvam ki releases a tiny bit of the uncomfortable tension by unleashing a watery melody thats soon joined by an unholy bass blurt this is no build-up though: stead its all build-up a claustrophobic dreamscape where nathan fake indulges his doom metal jones frightening the to the lone is less of a tormented fever dream of a track but not by much it pulses along more quickly than its predecessor quickly adding a minimalist snatch of melody to guide it along its way its a hook that wouldnt sound out of place on stefan goldmanns macro label but few other places in the dance music world (that feeling is quickly reinforced by the distorto-strings that swell up throughout ) its off-kilter to say the least but its a sexy confusion thats as transfixing as it is mind-boggling

the summer anthem is becoming a tradition reads a youtube comment underneath one of two tracks by gerd janson and shan on the labels latest 12-inch even among deadly disco-house cuts like hubie davidsons sanctified and final credits by midland is s most euphoric -side yet though the track is based on a sample rainbow browns 1981 track till you is much more than a classic disco vocal looped over and over there are builds breakdowns drum rolls and hands-in-the-air peaks all held together by jangly percussion and kept taut by subtle filter sweeps its swollen with pianos horns strings synth chords and vocals and yet it never feels overstuffed s easy appeal is reflected by the range of djs whove played it this year: ryan elliott nnie mac denis sulta and pete tong by comparison is a bit of a let-down the bassline is mostly to blame its six-note strut is formulaic and without a countermelody to bounce off it also lacks vitality the vocal chopped at one point into a sing-a-long melody and the spacey synths help make the b-side worthwhile but theres no doubt about which track crowds will remember come the end of summer
the austrian experimental trio initially sounds as if theyre some sort of abstract post-rock group drums synthesizer bass; you can queue up and it sounds a bit like legendary uk post-punk/noise/industrial group this heat rather than anything overtly electronic except that the track keeps sputtering and stuttering wrenching itself off its own rails in surprisingly compelling fashion what makes interesting and a change of tack for is that this time the band played live in their rehearsal space and then used a computer to re-organize what they had as lurches and stumbles its way through volleys of noise and sudden lashings of what sounds like a completely different track breaking through its suddenly clear that this was the unfulfilled promise of the bands like mission of burma that tried adding a tape operator to their rock setup the rest of is much further from anything that could honestly be considered rock but a lot of the albums interest lies in the way it never really belongs to any one genre or sound from minute to minute you try and pin it down and it slips away: first is a quietly menacing tortoise-style nocturnal city scene then gnarled streams of distortion cover over the slowly blooming tones still pulsing away; but soon that too clears to make way for the almost fuck buttons-esque upward progression that swallows the end of the track takes what sounds like fragments of the briefly quiescent middle eight from the first track and traps them in digital recursion veers from a booming hollow beat to full-on free jazz atonality only the closing follows a path thats at all linear and even then the subtly propulsive groove lock into has as much time for found sounds as it does the trios compellingly intricate instrumental interplay (the closest they come to something you could dance to its also the one time you might wish theyd opted to go for maximal appeal rather than purposefully obtuse inner voyaging) the result is an album that feels like its as much an interrogation into the bands own methods as it is music in any conventional sense but while things can occasionally get too academic for their own good (particularly on the too-lengthy ) for the most part show a keen awareness of the thin line between a bracingly experimental edge and disappearing up their own backsides taken on its own terms is a largely thrilling exploration of the area where experimental electronics post-rock improvisation and noise melt together
a split 12 inch is described as s lost and found release it uses a catalogue number evr010 that has been vacant for four years it maintains s international feel offering a glance at both the athens labels past and its future it opens with terekkes previously unreleased mix of by in trademark terekke fashion he peels away much of the boom from jorge velezs original and enhances the tracks drowsy qualities (its difficult to predict when well see new terekke material so archival cuts like this are some consolation ) two artists appear under aliases with little clue as to their identity beyond the locations offered by sydneys provides a self titled production of soporific new age beatdown followed by a track from talkin an old friend of the label an ep highlight is a loose house number that throws down some subtle busta rhymes samples it could be mistaken for an old wild oats b side pitched down a few notches associate makes more explicit hip hop moves on his slack jawed instrumental offering is another drowsy cut that stylistically might seem out of step on a label thats largely focused on warm deep house but this is one of those 12 inches that hooks djs in through one or two tracks the sprightly house contributions by and then reveals its versatility with time
in the rush to put erghain and panorama ar into two neatly-defined boxes raw techno and summery house commentators and clubbers alike tend to ignore the full breadth of the club and its attendant label few seem to remember for example that my my and nick hoppners refined tech house has come to soundtrack plenty of hours upstairs and way back in 2005 ndre galluzzi mixed the very first erghain compilation forgetting the latter is understandable galluzzi rarely plays the downstairs room any longer his sound a better fit for panorama ars less brutal environs the same goes for this ep for the imprint pairing the german producer with dana ruh for a two-track release that explores the hypnotic and heady sound that galluzzi has favored of late it sounds like little else on the label: pumps like the best sort of tribal minimal with voices appearing from nowhere and a rolling groove that has enough ups and downs to keep things interesting seems to use many of the same elements but in a less dramatic way theres nothing innovative about it but galluzzi and ruhs interests are functional: 12-inches are for the floor and this will likely work well on both levels of the famed institution
ep is the first in a new series of limited edition dance floor-oriented twelve-inches from the label it comes courtesy of portugese producer ivo pacheco whose work as gained wider attention with a release for opal tapes last year this ep is an extension of the melancholic interpretations of dance forms found on that release but this time around pacheco has refined his approach and given it a more direct conceptual slant like v/vms and lee gambles diversions 994- 996 before it this record purports to be in mourning for the lost golden era of rave but while its difficult to miss the memo three of these tracks feature the word rave in the title the furtive techno on offer only rarely displays the sonic calling cards of that particular genre granted theres a fair bit of vinyl crackle on display (the percussion on seems largely built out of it) but in most cases pacheco seems to be looking back to earlier manifestations of the wistful in dance music s tart synth line has something of an afx flavour while the glassy ungainly melodies of recall amber -era autechre gorgeous hiss-encrusted piano sketches that round off each side meanwhile fall neatly between drukqs prepared piano studies and caretaker whatever its progeny this is music of unusual subtle beauty making for a release whose ambiguities are amplified rather than resolved with each listen
its taken several years a stint in a welsh-speaking funk band and innumerable james blake comparisons but with has found his groove dafydd lived with blake when they both studied at londons goldsmiths university but this one-tracker is some distance from his old flatmates fragile electro-soul dafydd bundles rhodes pianos reversed keys arabic strings double bass cut-up vocals and frazzled chords to give a concentrated emotive hit of laidback jazz-infused house if its a taste of things to come then dafydd is certainly an artist to watch in 2015
sometime in the past decade fell out with the grime scene f you didnt know this already then a listen through -800-dinosaur presents should clue you in picking his way between meditative cymbal crashes on airhead-produced opener he brags dont think the scene coulda held my weight / y want me to have some respect like / know my place / fuck em on a muscular steppers rhythm he complains of his fame-obsessed peers: y dont wanna see me surface / ir beefs based on who runs the furthest and on ners : y call me fam but / we aint related / fuck the money / aint running around kissing and chasing it re wouldnt be anything wrong with this if hadnt been picking this wound since at least 2011 t was other artists shots at the charts at the turn of the decade that caused a prickly character with an unusual aesthetic sense to disconnect from the scene he became a sort of grime sensational collaborating across the electronic music spectrum with the likes of mumdance dro carey riva starr and commodo but after an album for rinse never surfaced ( fell out with them too) the mcs solo career faltered judging the content of his debut lp which has come out several years later and in a different form hes followed the success of his grime contemporaries with some resentment ts a shame that cant just let it go because his constant griping undermines his talents if you can look past the wounded ego -800-dinosaur presents shows that he has plenty faced with a volley of bizarre beats from a crew of leftfield producers the mc keeps his poise and style strangest of the lot comes from blake: is actually the albums weak spot with haunted fairground synths working like a prankster against s vocal as if blake is still in the bootlegger mindset of his harmonimix series other producers are more sympathetic airhead draws on the space and warm weight of dubstep for his three beats; happas hulking horn-led has an undeniable momentum; bullion packs the heat-warped weirdness of his recent album into lyrically isnt at his most mind-bending he seems to have slowed his verbal metabolism to match the often thoughtful instrumentals but hes not without witty moments (on his flows like arse / kiss me ; on hes such a big big mac to these gherkins ) balancing things out are a couple of peeks behind the ego on the boothroyd-produced shimmering pianos and guitar-like swoons prompt a rare flash of self-doubt or am some form of tulip in a cabbage patch / lost in hope of winning a set / and stuck on stupid / sending out silly little threats to my opposition he asks definitely isnt stuck on stupid but a bit more self-awareness wouldnt go amiss
has been peddling his smooth deep house grooves since the early 90s on a list of labels that read like a who s who of detroit house third ear mahogani track mode and planet e have all seen miller grace their records at some point or another andy vaz s yore is the latest label to accommodate his midas touch and he certainly doesn t disappoint things kick off with a vocal heavy conga jam that s peppered with neat little touches like backwards cymbals quick bursts of flute and some lovely affected keys buried in the mix this is blissed out house music par excellence although you may have difficulty getting away with playing it anywhere outside of the warm up house for the house then same can t be said for with its driving bassline heavier beats and veritably cosmic synth work re s a lot going on in the track but it s a credit to alton s deft production skills that things never sound too cluttered or busy for rounds off the twelve and it s a shuffling latin flavoured cut that effortlessly glides along for almost fourteen minutes without ever becoming tedious delicate rhodes piano cyclical live bassline and da-da-da-da-daaa vocal all add to the relaxed sunkissed vibe making it the perfect track for outdoor parties going later this year you might not get away with playing these tracks in a dinghy metropolitan club anytime soon but if you re looking for some richly produced deep house to soundtrack the impending summer months then look no further
the allstars series on has been in operation since 2004 and whether by design or not has always offered a weather vane for the clubbier side of the genre volume 6 doesn t break this template but in s hands it widens the parameters of past installments to focus in on a new generation of dubsteppers while past mixes read like a love in for those close to the label with acts like loefah benga coki and digital mystikz all figuring heavily the 18 tracks here focus a spotlight on producers whose tracks are pushing the genre outside of the typical dub dancehall two step cornerstones himself is one such producer like shackleton with whom he s split most of his vinyl to date he opts for more complex beat structures stringing together industrialized and atmospheric tracks that recall the early experiments in euro phile digital dub undertaken by the on sound label early meat beat manifesto and others given this more rigorous and experimental approach to dubstep it s no surprise that draws on producers such as and all of whom are playing with versions of the genre that are more palatable to outside influence it s a nice direction for a series that was beginning to grow predictable in its tastes after five installments gets things started in a slow and hazy fashion with two pole tinted tracks: and the more muscular the latter a skull disco collaboration with from earlier this year from there the mix perks up significantly with s a highlight from last year s nderwater dancehall of all the producers featured the hague s borrows the most tricks from minimal techno on their own his tracks sound as if he s yet to hone in on a distinct personality but in the middle of this mix he holds up admirably as a clean and compulsive way to transition away from hazy dub and dancehall toward more brittle breakbeats this is where comes in the only producer here whose linear garage tagged tracks work well on both sides of the mix: early on with and then again near the end with his remix of s heart that tail end taken up significantly by and is where makes the mix s allegiance to techno most obvious tellingly this is also where the delicate hold on the dubstep foundation otherwise maintained through the rest of the mix begins to slip and techno hybrids are all the rage at the moment with great tracks coming out on both sides but unfortunately the two komonazmik examples mixes in here (the ravey and the similarly retro ) lead the set into its least compelling and shallow sounding section luckily the mix comes back strong finishing with s catchy bassbin stomper reminissin above all tsep allstars volume 6 reveals that is a dj more interested in evolutions within the genre than playing to its biggest hitters he insists on taking the listener on a deep and varied excursion and he s not afraid of slowing things down or speeding them up to get the results he wants it s worth listening to this mix alongside his recent ra podcast which takes the journeyman s mentality in an entirely different direction between the two mixes has showcased if anything just how versatile dubstep has become in absorbing the music that surrounds it
in the wake of 2011s envision and its me remix which became one of the biggest house hits of the year st louis-born veteran publicly quit the house scene to enjoy other musical forms this ultra-limited seven-inch speaks to the tranquil greek-island existence he has chosen for himself but its title track still fits into a certain kind of house template albeit a more peaceful less panorama ar-ready one is a sweeping feel-good cut that blends sunny strings and a soulful house vocal taken from warwicks walk the way talk the comforting sound of traditional nigerian bat drums an instrument that has an integral place in the ifa religion of which is a priest sits in the mix high is a supremely laid-back bossa tribute that pairs a slinky piano melody with pattering drums and a breathy jovial vocal that repeats the tracks title n incongruously summery release for this time of year perhaps but new music from is a welcome arrival whatever the weather

map out the various labels george thompsons music has appeared on since he emerged as half of spectral empire in 2008 and a picture forms that seems far removed from the micro-managed music careers common today can you name many other producers whose work has featured on labels as disparate as island of the gods esp institute omnidisc boyznoise jealous god and unknown the fact that thompson worked with such differing labels last year suggests hes a musician with little interest in trends or hype refreshingly he appears happy for his work to reach new audiences it could also be because those labels were among the many fans of the sublime black merlin album hypnotik tradisi it was certainly the motivating factor for to seek out thompson for a four-track 12-inch that neatly sums up the various moods a black merlin production can embody the title track is a fine dj tool nine minutes of cavernous drums grinding relentlessly over swoops of reverse synths and guttural grunts that evoke the muscular drama of vintage ebm the sweet tingle of gamelan on could feasibly come from hypnotik tradisi s studio sessions offering a nice contrast to the simmering anger of which could be mistaken for rrose at a glance the ep closes with the fractured stasis of surely an ironic title given the solemn fog that billows out as it creeps towards its conclusion
berlin-based australian producer showed an impressive touch with disco and soulful house on im and high noon her first two eps for arms legs here she returns to daniel steinberg and nils ohrmanns label for a third time with two more cuts of gleefully maximal unashamedly nostalgic house at 126 bpm the title track is a relatively hi-nrg blend of airy bass and freewheeling saxophones topped off with the joyous sound of johnny dynells signature rap: tank fly boss walk jam nitty gritty youre listening to the boy from the big bad city is a little slower but has the same classic goodtime feel swirling pads flashing effects and more rap samples set the tone before the welcome appearance of a euphoric piano line this is fist-pumping good fun from start to finish

its important that people know i work and deal with the drain hole of the morticians sink wrote elysia crampton in 2012 golgotha is my business and my workspace is the trash bin the site of the crucifixion is a fitting backdrop to cramptons music which finds redemption in the wastelands of popular culture that word golgotha pops up throughout pitched-down and lurid like a mortal kombat ident the record released digitally in 2013 and now being reissued on vinyl sews the discarded organs of the familiar into strange new frankensteins monsters lots of music this century has rummaged through pops biowaste for inspiration not much of it is as ugly or as beautiful as cramptons light is the high-point of her work as a lot of which is now hard to find (you can get a glimpse from her dis mix and on bandcamp ) in s world toilets flush over glittering ambient tracks central and south american drum patterns spar frantically with videogame samples and pop acappellas are reframed as prayers to the eternal the results are all the more affecting because the elements are well-known as crampton told ras maya kalev working with recognisable references [the work] belonged to the listener the way it belonged to the referent the way it belonged to me and the music had no goal other than the desire to embody and connect crampton has since started afresh under her own name last years moth / lake 7-inch and american drift lp mostly ditched samples in favour of her own playing structures were more measured and uglier sutures healed over cramptons philosophical agenda has become more visible too when i saw her perform at last years unsound festival she interspersed her tracks with readings from a paper shed written crampton is critical of traditional academia but her writing shares some of its bad habits including a disinterest in clarity her music remains unique and her political perspective important but that desire to connect seems to have dimmed light sits between these two phases of her career its more ambitious than her earlier music and bieber or rihanna acappellas are supplanted by houston singer lashay who voices famous songs with a burial-like bedroom murmur but the emotional peaks are still extreme and the album lurches jarringly between two states one involves blasts of hyperactive sample-noise; the other rippling oceans of ambience the contrast makes for a bumpy ride but thats presumably the point in the former category is the excellent on which synth flutes skitter over deafening layers of drums and voices at the other end of the spectrum lashay sings rihannas part from take care over stately piano on and takes bonnie raitts i cant make you love me to a whole new plane of heartbreak on the incredible places john mayers syrupy when youre dreaming with a broken heart over henryk g recki-esque strings for an almost unbearable outpouring of sorrow at the climax a swarm of formula 1 cars zooms past the speakers its a harsh ugly sound and one were all familiar with in cramptons hands it takes on biblical dimensions

the facts: is a pair of producers already well known for their solo exploits in the bass music universe their debut ep ranges from hyper-swung slow-motion boogie grooves to rolling house at 130 bpm (a digital bonus track flirts with classic electro patterns ) at points particularly on the loping g-funk of cleos and the lush lazy it sounds almost like floating points might be involved hes not and ultimately the question of who is responsible might be less interesting than whats on offer here because the music holds its own no matter the tempo or the style the melodies are generous the rhythms both effective and original and the sound as sumptuous as you could hope for in low toms bounce off your sternum while soaring string pads suggest joy orbison gone space disco; in competing breakbeats hug it out against a backdrop of feel-good funk theyre at their best though when theyre exploring downbeat terrain cleos drizzles its portamento lead like honey over chunky congas while frames impeccably swung hi-hat patterns against lush jazzy keys as tough in its lackadaisical way as it is elegant
of the two glaswegian warp signees previously belonged to hudson mohawke; riding on the wave of success from his debut album and creating a stir with shows at places like the main stage at sonar barcelona but its the dark knight of the duo who looks likely to steal the spotlight from mohawke at the tail end of the year in the course of five reasonably short tracks his debut ep for the label keeps the theatrical menace of his previous work without going for the obvious bite lazy hacks might try to sink their teeth into a dubstep association but they would be horribly off the mark soaks up the multitude of sounds that spill out of glasgows musical streets from techno and r b to epic prog rock imagine a japanese anime film set in scotlands famous techno hole club 69 and youll get a picture of the light and melodic harmonies that mixes with his hard jagged stabs and nighttime darkness kicking off the ep with a fairytale-esque intro sequence that rolls into an emotional and trippy prog rock ode to hudson mohawkes fuse is as sing-along as instrumental tracks get takes things straight back to the club: big build-ups skewed female vocals and an infectious lazer zap of frequencies feature throughout jumps back to the band aesthetic with drum rolls for the intro and a guitar solo to close is a deep brewing r b-laden monster which keeps busy with intricate details flitting around the growling bassline and the whole thing whirls out to the gentle ah ah and oh oh vocal stabs of leaving the listener on a reflective high
s debut the natural partnership ep was naggingly difficult to place digi-dub slow-mo house new beat electro all were audible in tusks no-frills hardware jams but perhaps more as a consequence of the machines he was using than out of a referential urge returning to is his most challenging work yet where natural partnership for all its gummy surfaces displayed the occasional glimmer of cosmic excess this time around tusk seems content to hunker at ground level the records unifying quality then is a sense of immense weight each track labours over its footsteps as if half-stuck to a beer-soaked dance floor slow-techno number is probably the bounciest of the lot though the synth drones that slither mournfully by dont exactly encourage kinesis elsewhere s sinister synths diamond-edged percussion and sci-fi effects are almost drexciyan albeit played at two thirds the speed sharkeys and sharkeys reshuffle the same materials stodgy machine pulses darkside fx a mooching bassline into a dread-filled diptych played back-to-back that dead-eyed trudge starts to feel like itll never end its hard to think of a dance floor where such music would be well received but perhaps thats a failing of dance floors rather than one of

as a cofounder of the berlin-based keinemusik gregor s tterlin has been skirting peripheries for years both labels have nailed the art of modern tech house where weepy melodies and droning basslines do most of the damage is s tterlins first ep on dixon and mes label which this year has released remixes of howling a 12-inch from frankey sandrino and the ninth edition in its secret weapons compilation series it sees s tterlin deliver three synth-heavy tracks that prove hes a natural fit on the roster each tune is cut from the same cloth with straight percussion chugging low-ends and buckets of melancholy is the classiest track thanks to a hooky vocal snippet and clever restraint (the kick drum leaves for minutes at a time) it will keep a festival crowd enthralled me and solomun have rinsed it in front of big crowds even though theres not much more than a placid kick drum keys and an occasional clap to get people moving the same goes for and which in spite of the formers grating vocal feel curiously subdued for the big-room situations they will be used in as such it will take an expert dj to rock the main stage with these tracks
s edits are winsome and joyful hes one of japans most esteemed diggers and the gems he unearths are otherworldly every record he makes be it afro-balearic synth pop for macadam mambo a disco edit of yoruba singers black pepper or psychedelic overdubs (with dj ground as oyama edit) for most excellent unlimited sucks you into a far-out universe following japan blues subversive contribution to s edit series delivers four more uncanny delights on which seems to be based on a track from africa the sound of a balafon rains down on big drums and a burbling bass synth the eps other origins are harder to place but thats part of the fun is funky and exuberant while is more a maelstrom of noise with an invading sound overcoming the sunnier jazzier music underneath using elements of roberto muscis recently reissued music melds its parts into a more dreamy symbiotic hallucination
fter last years hh3 ep returns to killekill with three dark intense tracks that lie somewhere between techno and electro is the most classically minded of the three with a textbook electro cadence played out on a whip-cracking 808; what makes it stand out are a beguiling ostinato lead and a layer of chiming synths that smooth the violence of the rhythm like a balm the title track takes us down into bunker technos deepest levels with gritty industrial sonics and a driving 4/4 groove; ambient tones sizzle over the top leaving an air of burnt ozone its as doomy as anything youll find in techno but it never beats you over the head proceeding instead with menacing restraint (its easy to hear the connection to sandwell district who remixed youngmans hh ) is the eps most esoteric track and its secret highlight a maelstrom of swung kicks hazy drones and analog gurgle its claustrophobic disorienting and not a little evil but a fine spray of high frequencies offers a semblance of a silver lining like a halo ringing a rain of hellfire
how i wished this newest single on paul mudd murphys imprint had hit me before i packed up for a week on an island in the caribbean instead the debut from portuguese producers mendes l ada has to hit amid concrete-colored skies and the chilly rain-sopped week back from holiday regardless instantly acts as a flotilla back to such cerulean waters gently echoing wood clops keys that shimmer like chimes in a sea breeze a sunkissed sensation to the entire proceeding the duo have that patented claremont brand of blissed-out yet melodic sway down pat on the flip are two s from the idjut boys much like they did for their meanderthals collaboration with rune lindb k the duo take the space between everything and make it ripple version 1 keeps a toehold on the terra firma but by 2 lift-off occurs and everything beneath seems beautiful and distant each component from the bass drum to the melodic lilt of the guitars gets dubbed out to the point where one comes back down feeling cleansed if a tad sun-baked
we probably didnt need another slo-mo house producer but trust me when i say that its our good fortune to have one around anyway not that is a new jack the man has crafting tracks since the turn of the century and releasing them at a glacial pace via his le systeme imprint is his first effort in more than four years the three-tracker is a collection of grooves that move along at their own pace assured and unhurried the a-side stretches out a moaning mmm-hmmm-uh out to delicious lengths with an organ chord that locks you into place on the flip things get a bit more disco-inclined duncans smooth opening devolves into a plodding cut-up of wavering synths and brass bleats its a (downtempo) steppers delight closing things out the third untitled tune is full of muffled funk an infectious organ and perpetually goosed diva pad it out but its the dusty little vinyl loop in the background thats the key in it you can imagine duncan locked away in a room traversing for rare grooves for his next release lets just hope it doesnt take another four years for it drop
you may not subscribe to outspoken infinitestatemachine proprietor (and erstwhile r contributor) thomas coxs traditionalist view on house and techno but its hard to argue with the results rather than churn out tired tropes and worshipful drum machine etudes coxs group with preslav lefterov and dam ratana released two exceedingly refreshing and surprisingly future-forward 12-inches last year suggesting you can adhere to old-timey methods without necessarily making old-timey tracks their third release and the debut of their label affirms that theyre a force to be reckoned with turning in two lean-and-mean and deeply satisfying party jams doesnt waste any time: dropping us right in the heart of things pt sweep us up in sizzling cymbals and delicate auxiliary percussion priming us for an ascending bassline thats as uplifting as they come old-school touches like the unabashedly synthesized strings that carry the big hook are neither ironic nor na ve; rather theyre precisely what the moment calls for is a more subdued affair but dont be fooled by its forlorn rhodes melody and distant hand percussion: steadily unraveling the track spends all of its nearly eight minutes letting its good-natured snarl take shape s good as the groups analog hardware sounds the real feat herein is how perfectly placed and proportioned all these enviably meaty sounds are revealing pt as not just great sound designers but uncommonly good arrangers for an act only three releases in
the first record from s new dj harvey-run series comes with a fantastic bit of lore whilst on a balinese surf safari searching for a secret spot would be my guide harvey writes in the blurb accompanying this four-track 12-inch bombing through the jungle hit play and the truck was bathed in gothic berlin toilet techno holy shit said i what is this said while the actual story is more pedestrian is a world-class surfer who may descend from a cannibalistic tribe the music is far stranger than youd expect a mix of primitive electronics fuzzed-out psychedelia and rock roll attitude the ep begins with a bedroom post-punk track trading in the cool detachment of captured tracks projects like the soft moon unlike them theres nothing studied about stance he sounds absolutely mad singing the songs one word coconuts coconuts coooo-coooo-nuts i almost started laughing the first time i heard it is a buzzing minimal synth production little more than a droning pulse a kick drum that sounds like a chopper circling the jungle and a snare reminiscent of waves slapping the sides of a canoe the b-side combines that primitive drum programming with guitar that recalls cid mothers temples kawabata makoto at his furthest out builds a rhythm around an ominous synth arpeggiation while sunglasses-at-night vocals melt into a deranged growl on the ustrian-balinese techno cannibals guitar screeches over a plodding beat
des mcgouran made a crater-sized impression two years ago on keysound with scatter the most impressive slab of 130-bpm breakbeat since tessela scrambled brains with hackney parrot the irish producer has since moved to and started exploring 170 bpm a side of his music that comes to life on the weighty ep where he attacks drum bass with tension and release in mind theres plenty of silence to make the loud parts feel louder the drums hit in bursts instead of modern drum basss linear roll on breaks land like waves of artillery fire before a rousing second drop sends the track haywire its a rare drum bass track that stays dynamic for more than six minutes the other 170-bpm tune tackles hardcore tropes with precision drums and is as brutal as it is vibrant on both tracks anxious speech samples and wailing divas give mcgourans sound palette an old-school flavour while its modern engineering inflicts maximum damage on the flip is a 130-bpm track that makes up for its lack of speed with chunky drums two digital bonus tracks offer tantalizing hints of jungle with whiplash breaks and a bulldozing reese bassline they round off one of most exciting recent eps its a high-tech update on some of the labels fiery early records building on legendary legacy rather than rehashing it
ends a three-year hiatus for a detroiter who moved to new york in 2014 after more than a decade spent in new zealand theres little sense of that change on the ep which continues s luminous hi-tech soul as before in this case that might not be a good thing a series of solid eps for rush hour seemed to peg matthew chicoine as a purveyor of sunny dance music and is a less inspired and oversaturated holdover from that period chicoine sounds especially stuck on where a looped vocal and some synth stabs take the title too literally and a soulful counter-vocal in the breakdown fails to offer relief that one also suffers from an emotional flatness last seen on magic a track whose happiness was cloying and insistent theres more buoyancy to the deep house jam is splattered with hand drum breakdowns and silky harmonies but the central chord is too heavy an anchor and have different problems but both could use the space and shade of without the glaring melodies of its counterparts feels loose and free of angst a warm two-note bassline is the focal point but small parcels of melody and texture are revealed with each listen: modular whistles vocal coos and curls of saxophone take turns tugging at your ear its in less of a hurry than the rest of and its more impressive for it
there are many great labels but they just have one sound one techno sound for example for us it was always about breaking out when said this to resident advisor s matt unicomb in 2014 you could see what he meant for much of its life which he runs with his brother had been in a state of perpetual motion from turbid minimal through to driving dubby techno with excursions into electronica and even dubstep it felt like the brothers were always looking for escape routes but from 2012 or so as the munich label found new success its sounds began to consolidate the dubbiness became a dreamy smudged euphoria the drums started to boom taking on a syncopated lope that implied sampled breakbeats even when they werent present (though they often were) the grooves wheezed with compression as if theyd travelled a long way from the 90s perhaps and were stomping doggedly into the future as the style slimmed down so did the roster and these trademark sounds were batted between a handful of core artists until it became difficult sometimes to guess who had made what this compilation celebrating ten years of reflects several years of refinement its not about breaking out but the opposite: settling into a well worn formula only one featured artist is new to the label but it doesnt feel as though he is shed aka ren pawlowitz might be the single dominating influence on s ravey melancholy his contribution under the name ow reflects his more recent tastes along with r s s and s thunderous its one of the few straighter techno tracks on the compilation many other contributors invoke an older pawlowitz sound: the shed of shedding the past as developed and distilled across the catalogue take for instance the a forbidding broken beat groover that picks up rich vapour trail synths in its second half s finely balances rumpled funk with wafting euphoria amps up the melancholy on a twinkling night sky of percussion and sampled piano each of these tracks uses similar sounds and ideas to chip away at the same stylistic edifice theyre all excellent but across a dozen similar sounding tracks the quality was bound to dip eventually s has the rugged momentum but lacks the euphoric pay off the track is immediately followed by s a weaker execution of a very similar idea over polishes the sound on the jazzy which has an overlong outro and an awkward garage skip to its groove these tracks arent out and out bad their flaws might have been less obvious on a more varied compilation but with one exception s screwball doesn t seem to be going for variety it lacks those breaking out moments mentioned perhaps its those moments rather than any one style that have kept vital for a decade
what a great idea in a pleasing spin off from the compilation comes like t from compost where no less than four spinners are invited to select four tunes each introducing them to add a nice personal touch chosen four are and o thonnessen and together they chose a huge variety of music take s quartet the pulsing from e and the psychedelic song rub shoulders with the off beat and s set goes for moody instrumental hip hop ( nc) and a sublime spaced out moment in a collaboration with most enjoyable quartet for me comes courtesy of opening with the strange synth sounds of ryuchi next up is the gospel soul of inviting you to thats quite a voice n s exuberant joyful brass accompanies the frenzied vocal on before the unmistakable sound of the 0s from c o d and the catchy n closing up is o thonnessen with the atmospheric tune ndi the easy four to the floor house of rthur and the nicely spaced broken beat of lexander hope and in notice this is volume one of a series and compost are off to a flyer with this eye opening highly entertaining collection

it s crunch time for prog/tech/breaks all-rounders dark globe who have been pushing their nostalgia for the future album from which is taken since 20 in 20 re-released it with the single break my world but even a star turn from vocalist amanda ghost and a slew of cleverly commissioned remixes (cagedbaby swain) failed to push it over the top another year on and this disappointing collaboration is unlikely to change the producers fortunes the problem boy george whose voice is shot in his heyday the culture club frontman could have turned in the androgynous soulful vocals of a blue-eyed chelonis r jones but now he can only muster a strained yelp but don t feel sorry for dark globe this is their second collaboration with the street-sweeping has been (see 20 s autoerotic ) so they knew what to expect and while george picks up his broom we skip straight to the dubs the release is bookended by henrik versions typically mellow melodic detroit techno marred by rather obvious uplifting keys and chanting but the real revelation is dark globe s own flight dub rather than prepping for the dancefloor they turn it into a shuffling scowling exercise in depeche mode-style synth atmospherics it suggests a possible change of direction for the artists let s just hope they get the chance to pursue it
the new york hip-hop collective founded by stuart argabright in 1984 only released two studio eps before disbanding just over a year later the group which comprised michael diekmann of ike yard argabrights black rain collaborator shinichi shimokawa and dj high priest (nicholas taylor of gray) reformed to play shows and release a compilation this is riphop in 2004 together with their debut album ghost among the crew which came out in december features some of the groups first new material since the 80s the title track is set in a traffic jam well sort of: horns and sampled african drums rip through the claggy atmospheres of its all capped with a grubby bassline that sticks even as the noises surrounding it crumble is weaker all jazzy loops reverb and unthreatening beats hieroglyphic beefs up on his reinterpretation keys patter over a thick undulating mass of tightly knit drums and synths theres little of the originals sense of movement; instead the percussion synths and keys trace dizzying circles around one another thickening into a caustic web before dwindling away by comparison the other remixes seem unadventurous lv rework into a slow-burner foregrounding the roiling drums but doing away with most of the cacophony and the bassline the result is all pep and little grind gifted takes the opposite tack on his gloomy techno version of he reduces s racket to a dull sheen and dampens the groove to a dead-eyed chug but unfortunately does away with the originals paranoid mood
although irish duo havent really developed a single identifiable sound yet you can usually count on dara smith and ian mcdonnell to deliver their techno with strange little flourishes that make it stand out on the duos ep for new imprint theyre all about industrial revolution chic caked in soot and underlined with victorian dread the title track bears resemblance to mcdonells garage-influenced solo work as eomac as it spasms through each bar its like a sped-up version of what peverelist was doing a few years ago birminghams dj skirt pulls deeper into the netherworld destabilizing its percussive sounds until its a shower of echoed clink and clang rsspstp places another dangling percussive figure above detuned chirps and acid-barbed bass stabs opens up the furnace room heard faintly throughout the other tracks dominated by industrial hum and metallic scraping listen carefully and you can almost make out a beat
ogdan scasascia s music is rooted in sampling secondo his first modus operandi conjures a manic hypercollage using the sampladelic cut-up techniques of kufen circus company and the like while his other working alias is simply the same method allowed more breathing space the compositions on like those on the magnificent lso ep slowly blend interlocking layers of droning melodies which ebb and flow through the mix to create an endlessly modulating composition all held together by deep tight tech-house grooves the background elements on this record hark back to the earliest experiments on the ends where scasascia spun the dying bars of other recordings into loop/soup compositions in the vein of jan jelinek ut it s the winsome flow and evaporating cavern-reverb melody parts that make this ep truly special melding the high concept of the project to a gliding groove exquisitely tuned to make the deep floor ache than the closer begins with a lumbering groove that appears to be suffering from loop lump but as the melodies continue to fade the drums appear over time to be phasing in and out and with the addition of nothing more than a neat cymbal it all hangs together is explicitly the second part of a series following in a grand tradition of minimalist electronic producers like wolfgang voigt moritz von ozwald and donnacha costello it s an ambitious gambit but provided ogdan manages to maintain the quality seen thus far he might just pull it off quality stuff
james whipples latest release comes with a haiku-like text inviting us to imagine stealth pilots speaking / in the upper atmosphere / telepathically and to consider the producer himself as being daw / guiding a rogue missile as m e s h whipple is one of several young producers whose grim fascination with contemporary technology and warfare recalls the italian futurists of the early 20th century the cover of -dusk / -dawn with its lines of shattering and explosion isnt miles away from a futurist ode to mechanised velocity like giacomo ballas abstract speed + sound its titles meanwhile recall an interview given by a former us drone pilot to der spiegel in 2012 the pilot recounted switching to infrared sight on hot summer nights and observing afghan couples sleeping on their roofs i saw them having sex with their wives its two infrared spots becoming one of course nobodys suggesting this new lot are like many of the futurists proto-fascists apart from anything else we live in a very different time the futurists took a naive thrill in the clamour of industrial society and responded accordingly musicians now are faced with a hyper-networked world of silence and extreme speed -dusk/ is best understood as a response to that world whipples music isnt without precedents -dusk shares its stilted groove with autechres lcc the swooshing polyrhythms of breakout track scythians invited similar comparisons but just as fellow berliner tcf sounds like raster-noton on cracked software whipples music betrays his tools: the gridded contours of a daw -dawn is the more expansive of the two tracks and with its liquid swells of chords the prettier like its partner its extremely focussed and engaging but remains tonally ambiguous those hollow pad-textures dont evoke strong emotions so much as a state of distant unease the soundtrack perhaps to a finger pulling a trigger on the other side of the world
when one thinks the classic everytime springs immediately to mind 5 years on and the long due follow up is finally upon us is the name of the new production and it uses the vocals of kate jackson disc one on side a way out west provide another quality remix trademark wow here with the trademark breakbeat patterns a subtle piano line and good use of the vocals not an immense peak time track by any means but efficient nevertheless on the flip we have germany s pitch sulfer mix this the quicker of the mixes from disc one it has a flurry of subtle sounds in the background while the kick and hats is relentless not leaving much time for rest a breakdown deep into the track is a welcome inception in terms of arrangement a good peak time mix disc two on the a side we have s very own mix of the track now this is a pure peak time trancer big synths and riffs are the name of the game here breakdown s with strings and vocals are used to good effect this is sure to be a big hit with the trance heads and it is assured to have a big room appeal on the flip we have a yunus mix of everytime played by sasha digweed in their essential mix of this year this will appeal more to the prog heads trademark melodies from the turkish master of prog with subtle use of the vocals from the classic all in all three mixes of that will appeal to the subtle side of things with the wow mix to the peak time hands in the air stuff with the mix the yunus mix of everytime i m sure is enough reason to check this release out quality release again from
this release from blackwatch entitled im here is all about fun the vocals from mykel definately have a little cheek to it and may not be everyones cup of tea disc one the original mix on side a doesnt instantly strike you as a blackwatch production on first impressions there seems to be a funkier outlook to the track a usual 4/4 kick and hats meets a great baseline with real groove the vocals as i said before may not be to everyones liking and is similar to green velvets flash but the vocal line of cant you see me im here is quite fun on side b swedish outfit laid lend their remix duties it adds a twisted yet smoother edge to the original it uses a similar baseline and keeps the vocal line pretty much in tact from the original definately a worthy mix for the housier inclined disc two on side a soul mekanik also take a smooth house avenue with their remix and also add a funky retro feel to the mix they elect not to use the full vocal rather choosing to cut up effect echo and generally fiddle around with what mykel has to offer another good solid production from soul mekanik on the flip sir drew one half of chicken lips delivers a unique mix taking a retro outlook from the word go the vocals are used sparingly relying on the strength of the musical aspects think trisco muzak (wonderland ave mix) and you are on the right path definately a big party room appeal and another fine mix to add to a strong release

before catherine britton was a big-room dj with residencies at the worlds most prominent clubs she made bewitching house music her white-label records were among her best and most understated with exquisitely programmed drums that were dusted with her soft vocals they felt like private correspondence from her to you has revived the series with its fourth record after seven years of dormancy but the magic eludes her the difference is obvious when you put the needle on the kick drums dead-eyed march is designed for large rooms and while it would be effective s breathy vocals arent enough to make it more than a rudimentary tool is more compelling with vocal samples stitched into the patchwork background but theres still something leaden about it the best track is s reshape of even though it strays furthest from those early records the pounding kick aligns with techno and it doesnt have the odd vocal phrases of s older tracks but it is imaginative with a slapping snare pattern and a fake-out ending that leads to a spirited finale those last few minutes are a bright spot on a record that turns a series once known for warmth and personality into something more functional
peering at the dance floor from its fringes has offered an eccentric view of the techno world each of his eps has covered a broad stylistic range and their tone is shadowy and cryptic in line with much of the output of belgian label his third ep in as many years is more of a close-up view the hallucinatory fog has lifted and the rhythmic vocabulary is narrower favouring a graceful uk garage flex opener pulls off the transformation most effectively its a simple back-and-forth between distant melancholic chords and a dust-choked bassline but its executed with understated style on the other hand is little more than a woodblock-y groove prettily ornamented but lacking in drama rhythmically both fall somewhere between the groovy minimalism of berlins late 00s garage infatuation (think sheds the panamax project t++s wireless ) and the more lightweight shuffle of post-burial electronica (as does the richer whose chords billow like dust clouds) its an interesting enough zone but when the pulse slows to a stoned head-nod on dub techno closer the change of pace is welcome it seems works best when showing the breadth and depth of his talents
ongoing mission of clone and its many sublabels seems to be the perpetual reimagining of classic house and techno taking up the mantle this time is one of their stalwarts glasgows his preoccupation optimism and retro-futuristic innocence of chicagos finest 4/4 is as melancholic as youd expect with elastic beats tempered by thin pads and swirling background ambiance while the muted harmonies of s spread out in all directions to an invisible and distant horizon is more upright in its kicks and hi-hat ringlets chugging beats drag you up to a higher emotional plane once the snares come in but still its hard not to lose yourself in the smeared synth landscapes that float by like some futuristic watercolour universe reverential maybe referential certainly but when youve got tracks this immersive theres surely no limit to the amount of times one can get lost in such palpable alternative realities

is a new collaboration between old friends lee jones and fin greenall k fink met at college in the early 90s and were united by a shared love of chess and phex twin releasing an album as e v on kickin records in 95 they eventually went their separate ways but remained close two decades later and theyre back making deep textured techno under a new guise divided into heads and tails the ep presents two versions of the same song former is tougher and more direct with stark ashen synths repeatedly descending over sturdy kicks and claps s the track starts to wind down heavily modulated shimmers and delayed chords emerge sending us out in a downwards spiral of emotion tails picks up the emotive trail opening with a sparse eerie landscape of fractured knocks and pads soon the same patterns re-emerge though this time tickled by a new shooting-star synth line and underpinned by softer drums result is less imposing and more beautiful than heads
is allen saei a uk-based producer whos been active since the early 90s hes released on the likes of mosaic and ferox in addition to his own labels solid groove dark dot and cheap knob gags which was owned in conjunction with josh brent (aka schatrax) on quinox he teams up with french outpost popcorn to present two reissued tracks ( and which were released on in 1997 and 1996 respectively) alongside a previously unreleased track from 1998 ( ) and a new track is a nippy tech-house roller that ties filtered synth stabs to its bassline as threads drum breaks beneath the main kick adding some groove and texture res more of a disco-house vibe on in which a short guitar loop wraps around the kick and is garnished with horns and effects to create a pumping peak-timer is cut largely from the same cloth but with a slower more detailed arrangement things get deeper on and its a departure from the previous tracks atmospheric chords layer over skippy drums and cymbal crashes for a subtly epic production that proves hasnt lost his touch after 20-plus years

its only fitting that named after a form of japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment should seek to explore the haunted backlots of techno and electronica on his facebook page acharn the berlin-based producer who inaugurates the label uses similar language to describe his output ( abandonded backlots the restless spirit of eternal return ) suggesting close ties to the imprint for all the talk of eeriness sets off at a buoyant pace a tenacious bassline charges across resonant kicks which uphold a hazy layer of calls and pads the eps other better club track stands closer by the labels mo setting taut snarls and mechanized slashes over a burly framework but its on and that we get a real vision of acharn s dark and decaying world the former lays a black cloud of pads and hoarse vocals over a steadfast synth line while the latter closes out the release with a wall of muted foghorns punctuated only by an interlude of piercing shrills both of these beatless tracks are an uneasy if not uninteresting listen
niv arzi and dori sadovnik are a good-humoured duo which might help explain how theyve released on so many big labels the latest is life and death with an ep that continues where their recent the beach goths album left off by channeling a deep interest in genres outside dance music at their best they resemble liquid liquid with its chunky drums and bassline is hypnotic and powerful with spoken word from that add a decadent layer of trippiness could be a track from the peak-era dfa riding a grotty bassline into the ground it struts like disco and swaggers like rock the other two tracks have no such sense of cool spaghetti western techno that sounds like ennio morricone jamming with the doors feels like a dance music dad joke the long and meandering features whoops and chants that put a clumsy spin on tribal house but one of the best things about is their sense of adventure which makes them admirable even when they stumble
the seed of the debut release from and the label was an idea label co-founder akito wanted to release music that extended londons uk funky style in a darker more moody direction he sent producer west the brief along with a folder of old tracks for inspiration and this five-track ep was born the idea of leading uk funky into a gloomier place reminiscent of dubstep has been around for a while it held sway a few years ago among producers like beneath and keysounds self-proclaimed dark 130 movement the resemblance gives wests originals a throwback-ish feel though theyre more focussed and linear than much of keysounds output on the title track this is a boon its densely funky percussion and railway-bridge ambience keep to a strict linear programme; in the muted surroundings a pirouetting five-note melody takes on a magnetic power elsewhere however the eps conceit becomes a straitjacket is solid but feels like a less-inspired realisation of an identical idea (it doesnt help that its in the same key) only a glowering detuned bassline marks it out distinguishes itself through its more fractured beatwork but theres an unsatisfying thinness to it remixes from owners akito and d drive the concept into the ground little is done to the original ideas aside from obscuring them demonstrates that a manifesto can get you started nicely but it wont take you the whole way

ashley burchett aka has often endowed his productions with a certain manic edge the same kind which infuses every loop of the bells leading off in this respect is barely leaving for a bar a metallic but smooth hook bores its way into the brain causing the kick and sandpapery hi-hat to fade into irrelevance the sense of unrelenting hysteria is a touch unnerving shares a similar sense of intensity yet offers a touch more humanism this time the kicks seem to simultaneously bounce and stamp savagely melodic stabs regularly penetrate the tracks fabric like light pinholed into a gloomy room a buffeting rotor noise flits rapidly up and down violently stirring everything it touches in the second half detuned plucks skate speedily alongside introducing a touch more of the maniacal mood what impresses most however is the attention to detail this is highly functional music with consideration for the legs and brain though it also fits this category the title track is the most tame one by one the london producer inserts a wobbly synth into every crevice of the track and shakes them all apart tricky perc programming keeps the whole deal from becoming a simple matter of filtered melody pinned to a rhythm section

brothers ben and tom page are in the unusual position of being a live band at home in the dance music world they have four tet to thank for it: his text label released their glowing post-rock epic matthew and toby in 2010 since then the drums-and-synths duo have tried out dancier punchier ideas see the aptly titled lone raver on soul jazz but the muddiness of their live-sounding records and their lack of interest in precise body-moving groove has made a hard sell as dance music its usually the widescreen melodies that redeem them giving their best tracks a rich transportive quality strip that away and theres little left as demonstrated by this two-tracker for the ten minute is built around a pentatonic keyboard figure one which wouldnt seem to merit ten minutes of exposition it loops and turns over increasingly frantic drumwork riding the crashing waves of intensity in a way thats impressive but aimless the shorter has a similarly unconvincing core idea: a stuttering one-note synth pattern suggests a crisper glitchier mode which isnt carried through in the tracks unsteady drums and muddy bassline by the second half it sounds like the duo have no idea where theyre going

progressive is dead sound familiar it should because those were the very words written by a journalist in an english dance music magazine a while back the irony behind this bold statement is that said magazine is no longer published but progressive as a dance genre is still around and it s far from dead in fact i don t think it s ever sounded better or ever been more interesting than it has this year the proof can be heard in the superb amount of music featured on some of the best compilations that have been released during thanks to nick warren and deep dish with their sumptuous melodies the global underground series is back on track after nearly folding earlier this year they ve proven once again why they are one of the leaders of the progressive pack where compilations are concerned danny howells launched the 24/7 series with much acclaim from both fans and critics his and lee burridge s diverse interpretations of day and night sounds ranged from a chilled soundscape to dirty funky basslines and were enough to make you scream from sheer pleasure while the balance series had always been popular it was james holden s contribution in the form of balance 005 that literally slapped everyone across the face and brought this australian series into the minds of progressive lovers as a serious contender to global underground steve lawler finally released his follow up to lights out 1 with lights out 2 proving to be somewhat of a surprise there were still the tribal beats that are his trademark sound but now there was more of a house influence with moments of electro sleaze that when combined proved to be a rump shaker of the best kind so you would think that it just couldn t get any better that there was nothing left to hear well there is progressive just keeps getting better and keeps reinventing itself especially when you hear s everybody mixed by sander kleinenberg a name that has become synonymous with quality progressive music is club and record label from the moment of its inception as a club in march 1992 its emphasis has always been to present the best that dance music especially progressive has to offer with the release of their first compilation in october 1994 the mix collection mixed by then residents sasha and john digweed they set a precedent for all future dj mixes the fusion of art and music together with the talented mixing of these two now famous djs helped to create the benchmark by which all forthcoming club compilations would be compared to many it is an example that has never been surpassed s use of classical imagery in advertising and packaging has always helped to create a unique feel to this well-known name from my perspective i ve always believed they ve been spot on with their image as i see progressive as the classical cousin to the rock n roll that is trance their choice of djs to mix each of their compilations would always reflect this classicism thereby giving the music a timeless feel in the past they have enticed the likes of deep dish nick warren dave seaman and danny howells amongst others to create their versions of the sound with this new release sander kleinenberg s everybody is in great company and has brought a new and fresh direction in sound and image presentation of this famous dance music institute with this in mind it s clear that are moving with the times and are open to new ideas and directions ah sander not only is he easy on the eyes but he s even better on the ears the last few years have seen sander kleinenberg become a rising star and respected fixture in the dance music scene he first created a stir in 1996 when he released y d w (you do me wrong) on strictly rhythm which became an instant hit with such luminaries in the new york club scene as danny tenaglia however it was my lexicon which brought him worldwide acclaim in the progressive scene and is today regarded by many as a classic example of the genre as such it is one of the standout tracks on sasha s global underground 13 ibiza after an enormous amount of remixes and dj gigs he was invited to create a mix for the nubreed series it was his first compilation but not his last as 2002 saw his contribution in the essential series released to much favour his success has continued with his four seasons ep installments which has seen the diverse taste he has in that the tracks on each have ranged from trance funk and through to driving progressive beats this diversity can be seen in the different sounds of work to do and buenos aires the former is pure driving progressive with tribal overtones while the later is almost on the trance tip with its soaring melodies given s history and sander kleinenberg s achievements to date it was only a matter of time before the two joined forces to create a release that is not only highly regarded at present but will be respected and sought out by future listeners everybody is a unique journey into the new sound of progressive as much as it is an exploration into the mind and soul of sander kleinenberg while we ve become familiar with the image sander was given free reign to design the packaging himself his personality is stamped not only on the cover artwork and the inside sleeve notes but also on the actual cds themselves it s a treat just reading all his little scribbles and messages cd 1 or as sander has called it attempt 1 opens with the cheeky intro called the club that depicts the entry into a club on a particular night once past the door staff you can just hear the strains of sander s own work to do before we are propelled into solaris heights midnight a beautiful track with sweeping synths and sensuous vocals which helps to create a rather wistful house track the level is raised a notch with van bellen greed s city lights this still has that wistful feel but the bass is deeper and the groove already makes you want to dance i can just picture this being played at an outside party somewhere on the fringes of sydney harbour on a warm summer s night we then move onto a deeper house sound with nacho serrano s zamba on closer listening there are so many variations in sound and texture that it gives this track a very edgy feel alvredo matthew dekay s symbiosys flows smoothly next with its sensuous but funky feel there are samples of melodic synths throughout with the pace increasing slightly this combined with a breakdown takes you down a level and then explodes into full funkfest from funk we then journey onto the outskirts of a tribal sound indart meets plaza crew s in destiny (juan magan cesar del rio mix) is saturated with a dirty tribal bass that will have you tapping your toes in no time in some respect there is very much a latin feel in the overall sound and judging by the way my cat snuggled up to the speakers during this track i think it s a winner with felines up next is monkz s nu bluez with its funk and deep bass helping to create a modern jazz feel to a classic progressive sound this is continued with coruja sandoval s nativa with its dubby vocals a slightly darker atmosphere is conjured with be as one by rock (mein leeds) which explores fantastically warped vocals and hints of a more tribal sound the direction of the mix is then taken to a more upbeat sound through the lee cabrera remix of morjac featuring raz conway s stars a soaring beginning that ends in a driving yet melodic bass the vocal breakdown helps to create tension that is further enhanced by the resurgence in melody and then it bangs into a driving prog sound with a melodic riff that sounds almost like a smothered cello an obvious electro sound is found in pig dan s addiction with its minimal beat at the outset then moving onto tighter electro sound there are lots of multi layered sounds and the vocals are down right wasted in feel which is suitable given the title of this cheeky track it s absolutely nasty and i absolutely love it as we near the end of the first cd we are given two of this year s best tracks the percussive beginning of chable bonicci s ride leads beautifully into a deep dubby melodic bass with what i can only describe as a xylophone melody sampled over the top a track that is typically progressive in sound but with an uplifting feel without even know what this track is called or who created it you know you re listening to one of the stand out tracks of the year maybe ever there are so many sounds working together to create one of the most individual tracks i ve ever heard as far as i m concerned whatever luke chable touches it always sounds perfect in my eyes the producer of the year this is mixed seamlessly with matthew dekay band s higher thoughts which has the same deep bass but with a melodic piano riff the sound is much fuller and draws beautifully to a close without a doubt these two tracks go hand in hand and are mixed perfectly together as the last bars of the last track are heard you re left breathing heavily because your heart rate is running at a ridiculous pace you know you want more has seen the resurgence in melodic progressive tracks it s all about raising your hands in the air and screaming for the sheer pleasure of hearing some of the most beautiful tracks every released the first part of everybody is only a small reflection of this new sound as it also touches on the more tribal and house elements of progressive as well as hints of old skool funk while you forget yourself in the glory that is ride and higher thoughts you begin to realise that this is just the beginning of this epic soundscape as one journey ends another begins with cd 2 aka attempt 2 opening with joakim s come into my kitchen a dirty electro bass with robotic vocals and very much an 80s influenced track come into my kitchen well there s only one thing that comes to mind with this request so i can t help but smile from the underlying cheekiness of this track with the ewan pearson remix of seelenluft s manilla a more dirty bass sound is explored but with a very in your face vocal and the odd electro squelches throughout a very punk style progressive track that i m sure will get a crowd dancing in no time the beats are increased with nicolas vallee s new new york and there s very much an old skool disco flavour to the melody there are also more of the electro synths that aren t just dominating this cd but a lot of this years major compilations up next is the funky prog of simon s troubled soul with its dubby bass and melodic guitar riff followed by undo/redo s the voyager this particular track has a very minimal beginning that explodes into a bass heavy dance number that should go down a treat on any dancefloor the pace is maintained with groovemates natural sound which contains a sweeping melodic breakdown halfway through and turns the track into a beat heavy joy of sound i can t help but think that in some odd way this would have gone down very well in the studio 54 of the 70s as much as it will be enjoyed today touches of a funky techno sound can be heard in roland klinkenberg featuring miss bunty s funk the key word in way the bass is structured this track gets you in the dancing groove and before you know it your scaring waiting passengers at kings cross train station with your odd twitching and stupid grin this is followed by the simplicity of d2 featuring dan diamond s therapy (speedy s session) this track is all about the bass and the sexy vocals preaching the values of appreciating good music yeah i can relate it s all about the music the more i listen to this track the more i wish i knew who the guy was that did the vocals because he sounds like he s holding the secrets of many in his world weary voice with dj chab s my memory (romania edit) the direction of the mix turns back to an upbeat melody with a muted violin riff this is truly inspiring music and one of the many reasons why i love this cd so much with that in mind we start to hear the opening riffs of steve porter s definite form what can i say other than steve porter rocks his remix of amber s anyway was one thing but definite form is something off the planet this track is unbelievable with its halting beat and chime influenced melody listening to this track is like finding religion without walking into a church or believing in god i m instantly reminded of the lyrics in god is a dj by faithless: this is my church this is where i heal my hurt i think that says it all really it has everything that i love in progressive: a structured rhythm a soaring melody bleepy little moments and an element of funk in the bass really it s an aural pleasure as we near the close of the second and final part of everybody things start to get a bit calmer with the dubby bass of mick burns corrective tones and the austere yet primal feel of loway s 2 bags of grass (reprise) and then we start to hear sander kleinenberg s repeat to specify a wonderful bass infused track with a lush melody that transports you to another world if you close your eyes you can almost feel yourself soaring through the sky experiencing perfect joy a stunning finale to one of the best mix compilations for and an outstanding achievement by a remarkable dj while i ve enjoyed and will continue to enjoy both cds the second part is the one that i ve been turning to the most it s something about the cheekiness of come into my kitchen and the sexiness of therapy it s definitely about the majesty of my memory and the reverence in definite form above all it s about cutting edge dance music mixed to perfection by sander kleinenberg which will make you want to run to the nearest club and beg for music such as this to be played and the man himself have a lot to smile about over the last few months i ve been reading quite a few progressive message boards there seems to be this recurring argument that progressive isn t what it used to be i find this quite strange because i don t understand why people would want producers making music that sounds like it did in 1996 or 1997 why would you want that when you can have something like sander s everybody why would you want to live in the past when the future is so much more exciting if progressive is to move forward the sound must keep evolving and changing it may not always sound great but at the very least it s something to learn from with all due respect i ve heard all the northern exposure cds i need to hear to realise that i would much prefer to listen to the current crop of compilations and in particular everybody it s rich in melody and emotion aboveall it s a non stop adventure in sound progressive is very much alive much respect tracklisting: attempt 1: 1 the intro the club 2 solaris heights midnight 3 van

s might be niaras most functional record yet which will be welcome news for some the swedish label has long been an outpost for dreamy club music thats often covered in smoky haze its a great label in every respect though djs who like straightforward drum-centric tunes may not have been keeping tabs on it bergqvist bucks the trend on his loopy three-tracker recalls the best things about the turn-of-the-century tech house youll find dotted throughout his dj sets (bergqvist is one of stockholms most dedicated djs just ask bdulla rashim ) and trip are low-slung and groovy packing hyperactive basslines and crafty drums the former is spacey while the latter is the kind of dubby roller thats easy to imagine working wonders midway through a zip set on the other hand is more in line with classic niara: piano stabs a funky bassline and an earworm melody if wiggle surreal and choke mean more to you than smallville dial and giegling this ep is for you
has a lot packed into its 20 tracks: its a tribute to a charity benefit for his son and an all star showcase of the growing teklife roster as a wide survey of footwork its most easily compared to planet mus foundational bangs works compilations even though it lands on those two scene spanning discs from 2010 and 2011 showed the world footwork in its relative infancy outlines the genre in its cosmopolitan world conquering adulthood overflowing with new talent and continuously gobbling up any influence it can find footwork is no longer a strictly regional phenomenon which is in part due to hardens prolific work as the genres de facto ambassador when we first encountered footwork it was defined by rudimentary production values a speed demon rush and trippy free floating basslines as its mutated and intertwined with jungle drum bass trap and grime its grown into more of a feeling than a genre proper stretches footwork past its breaking point several times over s noir ish barely even sounds like footwork taking the genres obsession with weed to its most paranoid claustrophobic conclusions and slip jungle breaks into with the kind of precision usually reserved for surgical grade drum bass while s reinforces its foundation with fidgety fracture style drum layering production values mark the biggest difference between teklife then and now ny of these tracks have velvety tones and lustrous textures even famous for his crude cut ups seems inspired by the lusher side of house on wn core teklife members meanwhile continue to grow more soulful and funky makes his only appearance on the four way collaboration a powerful tune that embodies footworks sea change but the core crews turn towards polished sounds is only one part of the footwork story re are plenty of no nonsense straight for the jugular tunes too nnys presents the genre at its most elemental s s is typically brash and s feels almost like a legacy track repeating the word ghettotech as if to remind us of footworks roots all of this makes for a pretty jumbled listen especially when you throw in nearly unrecognizable twists from the likes of and re was a moment when teklife was associated with just a few core artists and one identifiable style but over time the stable has ballooned into something porous and open ended much in the same way the footwork scene has looked beyond towards the rest of the world sound is a fitting and powerful legacy for one of dance musics brightest minds to leave behind in his wake
somewhere between flying lotus and aybee lies multi-layered multi-textured compositions is downtempo broken-beat with loose live keys over swirling voices on driven course a chain gang chant drifts amongst disjointed electronics and loud bass and beats is dense but dreamy reverberating chords hang off a lurching rhythm bell-like notes emerge then jagged atonal ones round bass and distant strings float through the mix somehow the disparate elements work in concert title track may be four-on-the-floor but playfully ad-libbed keyboards call to mind hieroglyphic beings experimentation this is house music well-suited for home listening or late-night lounging
lot has changed since the arrival of on the international techno scene a little over eight years ago the stripped-down and dusty ostgut ton aesthetic rose to prominence throughout the late 00s helped by the continued success of its core artists meanwhile the turn of the decade saw a new sound championed by labels like time to express stroboscopic rtefacts and prologue rapidly ascend characterized by the unrelenting vision of its proponents kemppi has been among the artists mixed up in all of this the helsinki-based artists latest entry to the catalogue exhibits a sound more delicate than the label has been playing host to of late opener of plays with a streamlined kick and intricate midrange even making use of melodic keys before a weighty breakdown at its midpoint the more aggressive of follows its chainsaw bass building up to a rewarding intensity that never gets out of hand us duo donor turn of into an echoing bleep-riddled plodder the second half of which provides some of the releases best moments dead then round things out with a digital bonus contributing a ruthless rework of of for what stands as the 12-inchs most abrasive track when its all said and done though its the labels willingness to give kemppis more subtle textures an airing that will ensure continues to stand as one of technos more relevant imprints
mord first picked up giving us rowing sheep smile for the dead last year which kept up nicely with the labels grinding contemporary industrial sound the anonymous entity has since struck out on its own keeping titles eponymous tracks untitled and releases limited with such an agonisingly low profile techno broils away largely undetected and unchecked but each record unscrews the rivets a bit and on 003 the gap widens growing more wonderfully incongruent with every listen the a-side begins with a quick pulse and some smeared chimes using the seven-odd minutes to distract and disorientate its the thats the real bombshell here a minute in and out of nowhere the thing becomes a caustic bleep barrage in the vein of a classic autechre tear-out this one has the clout of a wrecking ball made all the more effective for being so unexpected it blows apart any preconceptions you might have formed about transforming their low profile into something dangerously volatile the deconstruction continues on the b-side following more of a broken tribal-ish 2-step style of techno that evokes the likes of szare and the darker strains of idle hands catalogue but none of it touches the absolute knockout

london based producer isnt exactly a household name in the dance scene but hes anything but a rookie releasing disco drenched deep house on his own neurythmics imprint since 2001 efdemins vinyl only will undoubtedly give the german native a wider audience as he picks up the baton from nina kraviz whose harrowing vocals left their indelible mark on the labels debut release is it safe to assume that phillip sollmanns label is a harbour for fresh or underappreciated house talent maybe so but be sure to count in the efdemin family as well this time instead of sollmann himself its pigon partner oliver kargl aka rdnm who rounds out the split ep is the winner here: his raw and pounding neighbourhood version) has an intoxicating vibe drawing its force from the counterplay of swayingly subdued chords and a percussive frenzy employs the same live groove but gets all cheerful with voices leading the scene onto an imagined sweltering nyc rooftop party flip it over and youll get the moanful dance floor funk of rndms a tongue in cheek if slightly enervating track though efdemin provides no beats on this 12 inch his touch comes through with the mandatory accapella : film buff that he is sollmann throws in a nice piece of cinematic nostalgia

alian producer makes his debut with a heavyweight digital package on the brighton-based uk label that has a deep tribal feel overall the original mixes of and both groove effortlessly along with being the meatier of the two using some saxual touches vocal snippets and bongos to keep it going uses a nina simone-like vocal sample to push its head over the understated parapet and has a sinewy feel to it which is fleshed out later on in the track by a bass injection chris s uno keeps the congas and thickens the bass emphasizing the separation of voice from recital and has some nice warm keys to pad things out is a ubiquitous name in these circles but quantity is by no means a sign of a lack of quality as these two distinct remixes show deux throbs menacingly throughout and is the darkest of all the offerings in this package resembles the original of in approach but has a much fuller sound finally blms of takes us down nicely with a deep dubby offering full of atmosphere and evocation but spoilt slightly by what sounds like an echoing off-key steel drum the originals here speak well for themselves but its nice to be able to feature two quite different interpretations of the same track by the same remixer as well as a warm blm remix nothing groundbreaking going on here just good solid dance floor tackle
the boys from return to the scene this time with a dj mix album for the series after the success of their artist album in morning sci-fi the true fans will be pleased to see the lads set their stall on a mix album an album that also shows the true talents of the lads not only in the studio but behind the turntables the mix is full of quality productions let it all out by forme is one such early highlight a deep and moody breakbeat number that sets the tone for the album the familiar acidic riffs and twisted breakbeats of the hi-fi bugs also impress early with the knife drawer the lads whip out a bit of a classic as they unleash my kingdom a melodic number by the future sound of london to this point the album has flowed delightfully with the trademark broken beat sound that are synonymous with then chip in with one of their own with in good we trust and then luke chable unleashes his twisted remix of david by gus gus the brilliant vigi nectarios remix of pheonix by nectarios signals a shift in the album as it gets a little more peak time and sinister in its approach the fusion of the next two tracks is something to behold the twisted sounds of andy page lee burrudge s why are the pretty ones always insane meets the acidic riffs and dubbed beats of chemical beats by the chemical brothers it s a brilliant part of the album thanks largely to the innovative mixing by the album then hits peak time with the stunning stereo 8 remix of orbital s sunrise followed delightfully by the vocal delights of s blackout i must say that i really do like this album and that being said i tend to like everything these guys do they stick to the old fashion roots of playing good fun music and this album doesn t have a dull moment in sight all the tracks are very solid in their own right and they are mixed very tightly and innovatively by the lads they have hit the nail on the head yet again

inevitably overshadowed by ibiza barcelona and madrid valencia still has a small but well formed scene and at its heart is edu imbernon is the name of the night the locally born dj/producer runs in the city and here he pays homage to it in collaboration with madrid duo los suruba imbernon is developing a rep for using guitars in his productions see last years imberlove and 2011s remix of the xxs crystalised and here is no different makes liberal use of a zither-like twang thankfully without ever threatening an indie-dance revival its crystal-cut mood-laden (not moody) analogue house with a techy sheen fellow label-mates adriatique launch into deeper territory twisting the originals guitar to give it a middle eastern flavor and placing dubby pads alongside it italians dirty are another alumni and they complete a pan-european package with a tougher mix that works in a jacking groove and a splash of acid
frank sweeney had himself a small moment back in 2012 when his music caught the attention of jamie xx and local label major problems released his first single as frank b chain of fools but the dublin dj and producer soon dropped the soulful house project to focus on his alias for more experimental dance music is the second record and follows 2014s eclectic office of public works with three concentrated blasts of blown-out acidic techno its not an unusual sound by any stretch but sweeney finds interesting ways of twisting the formula in places though its easily the eps least danceable tune stands out for its thick tension and relentless suicide-esque drum machine its altogether simplistic maybe even derivative and yet its blend of early post-punk energy and nascent techno would be intoxicating at the right time and harbor are far more versatile with their club-friendly beats and distorted 303 sequences which actually makes them replaceable in this realm of gnarled dance music sweeney does good work managing the dynamic intensity of his title track and creating a sinister sound world in but theres otherwise little else thats remarkable about them
speaking to teshno earlier this year paul announced plans to start a new record label follow-up to the long defunct the self-titled label that launched his career in 2009 begins with three smoggy deep house and techno cuts from the uk producer far cry from the merry afro-house he made his name with captures in a pensive mood a reference to his on-going battle with multiple sclerosis appears in two separate versions the extended mix is a 12-minute meander through fields of glinting synths bumpy kicks and tender pads powered by a slow sonorous bassline its more sombre than weve come to expect from but no less earnest is a little punchier and equally engaging throwing cosy chords and acid stabs over a great frame sees us out with s darkest track to date built on the kind of mean groove that levon vincent has made his own its as rich a techno track as youll hear all year

mark venneri returns under his guise to deliver the 9th release on his imprint with the talents of italian producers m a s collective have been used to supply the b-side remix the original is first up and it is quite a classic progressive cut with a pretty intense and never give up flow the beats and deep baselines are ruthless while the stabbing pads and subtle string patterns in the background help make this quite an epic production at heart the middle section gets a little deep and dark before it unleashes itself again in the 2nd half a fantastic track by that relives the glory days of progressive m a s collective deliver their remix on the flip which lifts the tempo up a notch and features the smooth vibe that is common with their work for me though it doesn t live up to the fantastic original mix which is no shame as the a-side is quite stunning a very tasty release here on with the original a must look for progressive aficionados

an eagerly awaited album this but something of a mixed bag throughout its 22 tracks ( ) king britt explores new textures lyrics and speech rhythms using musical styles that encapsulate hip hop soul and 80s funk amongst others a wide range of guest artists make for a constantly changing sound picture but that still doesnt stop the album outstaying its welcome somewhat however there are some radical tracks here rich medina lends his lower-than-barry white tones to the thought-provoking planetary analysis and the closing a foreigner no longer while by contrast the helium-like tones of quasimoto give plenty of tautness on spaces effective use of cross-rhythms makes the sound one of the stand-out cuts and depth (featuring roblife) is spacious in texture id recommend avoiding the three observations tracks however as these come across as pretentious an interesting record certainly and highly original in places but ultimately too long and inconsistent dont be surprised if the next record is more coherent and hits the bullseye

boris english k has been entrenched in the bristol scene for the better part of a decade but its been only in the last couple of years that hes established himself as a producer collaborative outings on brstl pple pips and never learnt have led towards this first solo ep on nascent rgot sub-label plump balmy chords confidently announce s solo arrival yre supported by stocky kicks and a meaty rolling bassline intricate synths twist and shout playfully in the background leaving plenty of room for the tracks central piano to run its quasi-celestial course falls nothing short of sublime through its timeless fm chords and robust drum programming while you sets off down a more familiar path laying classic house stabs over a thickset groove fusing broad pads with rippling synths coats his framework in an alluring organic mist managing to cultivate a sound that feels both strong and sensitive
woodside ep is a four-tracker of knobbly mpc house jams from a bologna-based duo whose records look to the midwest for inspiration (their six-track debut super quartet closely echoed kyle halls homespun funk ) coarse textures and gummy beats are often par for the course on records like these but woodside is often too rough-and-ready for its own good s ashen hi-hat scratches at s rhodes keys like a dry cough and 50k overindulges in its low-pass filter 12 13 is where demonstrate some guile on top of a loose hand-drummed loop sunkissed synths and crunchy vocal samples are stirred into a pleasant groove there are better versions of this sort of thing on the usually excellent label josh tweeks space kitchen for example but it does at least give woodside its sole bright spot substitues s satellite-bleep pulse is undoubtedly absorbing but like a lot of whats here its little more than a sketch in need of some colour
keysound isnt what it used to be spirit remains the same still channeling the urban anxiety of london but the labels personnel has seen a huge sea change only founders and have held on through the years but it might be even better than it used to be keysound has a sterling roster of new artists and the brash pronouncement of this is the new wave that opens the labels first compilation says it all godzilla sized collaboration between and is not just a clever idea its an aggressive display of pure muscle and bravado y form the foundation for keysound mk ii a stunning collective of young producers who deal in urban edge and hardcore continuum thrash this is how we roll offers up their prime selections amidst a number of reworks of recent keysound staples s impressionistic becomes nailed down by leaden drums s lithe gets dubbed out and shaken and put a welcome drum track underneath an ambient vocal waft from last year this is how we roll also has a number of label debuts e m m a comes out looking the best with whose big foamy synths are welcome relief after an hour of percussive lashings sounds like a guido acolyte with shrieking string samples and slovenly drum hits while s satellite provides the most acrid grime beat since anaconda out screwfacing everyone else here add that to the disorienting hall of mirrors from and the dub comedown of s and you have a compilation that leaves no stone unturned title this is how we roll isnt just cheeky sloganeering either it refers to bossman martin clarks sub zero rollage a term he coined to describe the ironclad pulse of its a phrase that perfectly wraps up the entire rosters tendency for antisocial paeans to concrete and steel and if this is how they roll theyre blazing past everyone else in their path

kicks off its the same way it kicked off its 2008 nd 2007 nd 2006 the backwards looking caifornia based detroit bred imprint continues its relentless homage to its birthplace with three quality tracks that prove that theres nothing wrong with tradition coyote sees dj dex and esteban dame in collaboration for a reaching for the stars manifesto of live percussion and yearning strings s unbridled enthusiasm walks the fine line of cheese heard in the wrong context but the deep bassline serves to ground things capably much harder is s relentless detroit techno burner the pounding refrain is given some moody vocals and a hearty clap along the way and is only leavened by a descending line s not much but it effectively allows some of the titular rays to find their way in closing things out is the highlight: santiago salazar and the aforementioned dame take in influences from all over the map most notably from detroit and ngeles on to craft something that reaches beyond both traditions s one of the first signs that the crew is finally getting past mere retreads along with salazars forthcoming 12 inch on macro just what is that keyboard solo four and a half minutes in or the stop start syncopation early on the pieces may all be from somewhere specific but the sum is something altogether different nd its exactly the right way to treat tradition: s a jumping off point for somewhere else
its about damned time was all but wol there for a few years and then last year he finally turned up with new eps for mule electronic and diynamic and a handful of remixers for folks like onur ozer ripperton and ed angers mickey moonlight (huh ) followed now after almost a year and a half since the last ep hes back with a two-track single for dial for this diehard fan anyway it was worth the wait dont go looking too closely for traces of his great 2005 album we re monster ; in the past five years rajko muller has backed away from the squelchy funk of that album t a time when underground house and techno were pruning back to bare branches we re monster felt positively purposefully overgrown now that minimalisms a dirty word seems to be stripping back his own approach oth tracks sound more smallville than dial really with their warbly repetitive grooves of is hypnotizing as a rock tumbler with weirdly burnished tones churning over and over; you need to listen to its full nine minutes preferably multiple times to fully appreciate s gift for stretching time laying out luminous synthesizer lines to lead you deep into his befuddling alternate reality strategy isnt all that different from villalobos but s teasing is warm and sensual in ways wholly distinct from the chileans nervous prickle is tougher with spiky syncopated stabs and purposeful rolling sub bass formally it sounds like a lot of current deep house bus s version hasnt forgotten the importance of a sense of mystery finely whittled percussion stays low in the mix; the midrange never overpowers allowing you to unclench your ears and hone in on the warm liquid phrases coursing through the background
coming off norman cooks southern fried label is s - the band consists of vanessa robinson and dave johnson whos previous singles have been described as moloko meets daft punk true as it is at they take the best and worst influences from both of those bands grandadbob is a real person hes vanessas grandfather and boasts a hed full of goodies he has also featured on the bands t-shirts and had a cameo speaking role on one track vanessa and david met when he was working as an engineer in the studio and met when she came into to record some vocal parts the band started as a four piece but once studio time came around there were only the two of them left the city of sheffield has produced its fair share of notables in the world of music such as the human league pulp and moloko what all of these steel city types had in common was an endearing eccentricity that marked them out from the more run of the mill bands follow in that fine tradition with the wonderfully titled producing a summery blend of daft punk-esque house beats and catchy melodies they follow a catchy dance tradition but theres more depth to this record than just big beats - theres a sensitive streak in the production that complements vanessas dreamy vocal and offers more emotion than straight-up house these waltzes should appeal to more than just weirdos uniting chilled deep house with dreamy vocals and a rather nice string line good house with soul seem to tread a fine line between classy funky song writing and self-indulgent nonsense and its the same with on the plus side they specialise in a rich deep sound thats bound to seduce both clubbers and non-clubbers alike tracks such as maybe which blends a groovin baseline with an organic guitar loop which turns out to be filtered beyond recognition which is also up tempo a sample the same as the title suggests adding in a slapless baseline on the downtempo tip portishead-esque open mouthed with a touch of beth gibbons influence this track consists of a more eclectic arrangement of sounds some tracks seem prone to bouts of self-indulgence and lean towards self-conscious cockiness kenny for example features a sample of a child s voice crying it s yer silly banana it s charming at first but soon becomes irritating the daft punk influence can be heard in the overwhelming array of odd noises on the final tracks anger thy neighbour together with the appearance of the dreaded vocoder on city approach a shame as its clipped guitar sound is one of the highlights of the album there are enough touches to indicate that if they can reign in this more self-indulgent side there s a great band waiting to appear robinson s voice is superb throughout and the album suffers when she doesnt appear for example on the repetitive your mama waltzing for weirdos is certainly a promising debut from the duo and definitely suggests greater things to come if they can concentrate on the song writing and reign in the more annoyingly quirky side of mutant house a truly great second album could well be the result track listing: 1 monster 2 city approach 3 mmmmnn 4 your mama 5 this is it 6 maybe 7 open mouthed 8 3am gherkin 9 just show me 10 killed by sweets 11 kenny 12 anger thy neighbour
the second release from erlin label continues the vein of hard-edged high-polish techno established last year with deckas egyndelsen ep this two-tracker from trans m two ristolians named only as harry and james values low-end refinement and rhythmic precision over bludgeoning sonics sure -side s barks at you repeatedly but its the harshest thing youll hear on and the way it contrasts the tumble of mechanical drums only accentuates the tunes breadth shudders of sub-bass and punchy kicks thrust through a gauntlet of percussive accents claustrophobic atmosphere and modulated bass snarls which is strong dance floor fare no question and could easily be mistaken for some unknown livity sound track trans m do themselves a favor on s opening their hometowns trusty palette of dubwise techno to a couple unexpected sounds theres real talent in s dialed-in subs and sharp drum programming just not enough ingenuity to set it apart
such is the speed at which new labels crop up these days that some are sprouting fresh offshoots before properly taking root themselves case in point francis harris and scissor thread which only launched mid-2011 but has already spawned a subsidiary label in time will tell whether this becomes collins main creative outlet but for now at least he seems to have created the perfect niche for his talents everything about feels as if its been sitting in the sun for a long time the colours are drained and pale the sharp edges softened and the canvas cracked and curled its lethargic but not drainingly so and each track has more than enough groove to reach the requisite level of energy to work on the floor raw hats sharply sit proudly astride doughy basslines with the monochrome landscape occasionally punctuated by the occasional incandescent flash s triumph is that it buries so much feeling in what is a relatively straightforward exercise in deep house the way that collins allows the separate parts to bleed willingly into one another is entrancing and by the time youve got to undoubtedly the eps highlight your heart already belongs to him
having continued to assure its place as a reliable contemporary club label tsuba takes an appropriate side step for its second full-length release presumably aware of the fact that an album of ten or so similarly floor-facing tracks as those released on 12-inches wouldnt cut it boss kevin griffiths turned to self-styled party caterers carter brothers for something a little different and its easy to see why going on the aussie pairings output to date y have churned out everything from full-on disco stompers to stripped tech house workouts in the last year or so most often on monty lukes burgeoning black catalogue on tropolitan there is a similar sonic diversity across 13 tracks its clear they want to take you on a ride starting out at a vibey house party things slowly move through the found sounds of a street walk and into the darkened bowels of a club before ending up back at home on the sofa with a doobie chilling to spaced-out jams as such a lot of ground and many styles are covered and although that can sometimes be a recipe for a mess are adept enough producers to nail each mood at which they take aim cogently threading them together into a nuanced night-time narrative after the sound of a harpsichord drifts through an underground station on the ensuing passage is almost a study of genres from widescreen redshape moodiness on point taken to insular deep house via jumbled revenge-style numbers as standalone tracks much of tropolitan will do the trick on the dance floor even if a distinctive personality is somewhat lacking s their ability to thread these parts together into a greater whole though that make the loveable party caterers they claim to be
leeds based label 0: 0 is one hundred releases old and what better way to celebrate than to release one of your best albums yet that honour goes to carl finlow whose project is rightly earning plaudits in house and techno circles finlows style falls neatly between the two with bits of electro also thrown into the mix and the result is an album of deep tracks for either club or home listening ts a mostly instrumental album but starts with and its catchy vocal clip m breaking down the barriers (rather apt) which also surfaces later on in other vocal treat is the guest spot by georg levin a bit more soul added to the already cool house beats deepest tracks on the album are the building chords of and the electro touches added by finlow to is a spacey number while characterises the sound perfectly - surprisingly intricate if you listen close up but also great mood music if you dont warm funky bass of is a great sound some 0s inspiration coming to the fore here and shows how finlow can do just that without having to resort to the cheese f youre a fan of metro area or herbert this album comes strongly recommended - it could turn out to be one of the artist albums of the year so well does it respond to repeat hearings
more than anyone else on the roster has come into bloom before our eyes fter the grizzly bacchanalia of his first two singles he started burrowing into the densely looped knotty aesthetic with twisted bleach while that ep lacked a certain clarity of purpose each successive release has sharpened its focus nd on the ep his blade has truly reached its diamond-cutting potential: no longer the dark horse of as r s ndrew ryce put it a few years back fengler here presents his most assuredly inventive tracks yet sounds like the track fenglers had his ears set on for at least the last couple of years: impossibly dense considering how hard each of its elements hit the track is a wonder of timbral balance and crafty sound design (considering how neatly these myriad key stabs hi-hats and countermelodies slot together youd think fengler was a closet reorganizer not a globetrotting berghain resident ) the next two cuts however show fengler gazing toward his future in a shows a less wildly rhythmic side of fengler but amidst a neon swirl of big-room synths that directness makes for quite a powerful build though really comes out of left field: airy and dare-i-say tenderly melodic it sounds a bit like robert hood releasing on macro with that manic energy occasionally leaping out from the underbrush with a playfully menacing hiss
s cinematic grandeur has found a fine home on for the past couple years and his newest ep for the imprint doesnt do all that much different coos and gurgles and glitches its way along its path auditioning for henry saiz james holden and others who fly the -but-still-doing-prog-right flag coopers genius is in the last adjective above glitch gives you the sense that everything might come toppling down at any moment a far cry from the obvious ups-downs-all-arounds prog past coopers coming at from a different angle though he loves tim hecker more than he loves nick warren you can hear that in the trembling throb but hes not above a little obviousness either dons a pretty normal 4/4 beat even as it throws animal growls and a wah-wah synth into the mix is back to normal: its new mexico techno with chords that reach out into the dark empty sky until forever (and beyond) melodic tech house champ john checks in for a remix meanwhile driving a hook deep into your pleasure centers with a minimum fuss
for anyone curious about what a marcel dettmann and shed collaboration would sound like is a good place to start the berlin-based canadian channels both of these producers in his hazy techno productions which on explore slinky 4/4 and booming broken beats its also a style perfected by the munich-based ilian tape label another likely influence on ford take and its blunt kick drum which stutters around the grid in jagged patterns its soon joined by soft chords adding a sense of melancholy to an otherwise booming track eventually a playful melody emerges from the haze a flash of beauty in a bleak landscape tucked away on the b2 is the most original track it has the eps only straight drum pattern anchored by another blunt kick a nimble melody dances atop the percussion which builds from a dull pulse to a tangle of high-end sounds the energy rises and falls refocussing the attention on different elements the ethereal melody the bubbling bassline each time itll take a smart techno dj like the one running this label to get the most out of its subtle charm and are heavier broken-beat options with tough drums and yawning synths in fords hands its a great formula
people talk about dub techno a lot but dub house is a term thrown around less frequently the last time a record fitting that description struck me strategys future rock it was 2007 almost a decade ago like strategy s hunter p thompson hails from portland oregon a place known more for its experimental musicians than its clubs under his ambient and new age guise opaline thompson probably qualifies as an experimental musician proves that hes tuned into the clubs energy too a six-track cassette (all of thompsons releases are cassettes) isnt so much vague as it is hazy rich in reverb the music is dreamy and blissful while each track takes on its own smoky melodic elegance three in particular do so with irresistible dance floor rhythms s glassy floating keys feel especially euphoric while offers a contrast of crisp snares and velvety synths alongside energetic metallophones s droning keys lift you up while hi-hats and percussive synth hits full of delay keep a strong hold on your body akasha translates from sanskrit to mean different but related things: space atmosphere sky elemental its fitting then that manages to create one complete entirely pleasurable vibe

both on the ronto music scene and in the blog house community to which they kind of got (wrongly if you ask me) associated are an oddity for instance there is a definite clash between the way songwriter ethan kath and vocalist glass portray themselves (emo-tinged half punk half goth kids) and the way they sound (bitter-sweet electro pop with a sometimes noisy edge) they also self-release stuff on rare limited-pressing 7 singles for obscure labels such as rok or trouble records then sell out to the man by compiling almost them all on an official album or by remixing uk s own hype kings klaxons and bloc party furthermore they like to keep an aura of mystery about them in interviews and on stage (if they even care showing up that is: they apparently have the reputation of being quite erratic in that area) yet tracks like or are extremely melodic and dare i say even a bit cute but what consequently appears contradictory on paper somehow sounds terribly coherent on album and the duo s eponymous long player reveals itself to be an engaging beast recalling the diy aesthetics of once-youthful scottish trio bis as well as detroit s own adult at their most mechanically yet effectively cold by putting together discrete tracks recorded over the past three years sounds immensely coherent even when it is not at all at times for example samples are either sounding too abrupt for the song s own good (that dfa 1979 bit at the very end of feels more like a studio mistake than anything else) while the recording of an unmixed practice of singer (tautologically called ) is raw technologically-enhanced punk that is both highly unmusical and conceptually fascinating but it is not always like this: on the entire vocals of a van she song ( sex city ) are recast into a truly gorgeous synth-pop moment a mood duplicated on tracks such as and ; and on the other hand are as brutal as they are compelling then as the one truly punk gesture on the album they totally switch gear on our ass for the closing track by going somewhat sweet and acoustic echoing both slowdive s take on shoegazing and the lo-fi recording ethos of flying saucer attack (anyone else remember them ) is puzzling at first mostly because it feels like they re just taking the piss out of fans but repeated listens actually show a ludic and playful band that ends up sounding way less serious than they re trying to make themselves look therein truly lies the duo s idiosyncrasy
if youve seen kieran hebden live as four tet then you might expect the improvised to be a mixture of rough inventive beats and electro glitches youd be wrong and indeed the exchange sessions project as a whole (recorded live sessions between hebden and veteran drummer steve reid) is a totally different bea(s)t likewise if you expect that reids experience with the likes of miles davis and ra would inspire ground-breaking and off kilter drumming youd be wrong again with you hear snatches of what theyre capable of (together) but unfortunately and i do stress unfortunately for the most part it s a diluted version of both take built around a looped that resembles one of those effects key rings kids had in school which reid drags forward by breaking his crescendo of pattering into a beat hebden responds with a / pulse but then frustratingly stalls beyond a light sprinkle of tron-like computer effects and blips opener is also symptomatic it concludes with out-of-control tape reels and a volcano of noises but you cant help but think its because hebden doesnt know what else to do impression one is left with is that the pair dont get each other enough to produce something really startling given this is only their third cd together; this should perhaps come as no surprise although the potential is obviously there you hear it on tracks like which sounds like a very wonky and quite sinister childs toy being wound up and played and which fuses a delightful tune which wouldnt be out of place on four tets pause with drumming that senses the shifts by switching from a solid beat to more free expression how instructive that the best tracks are remixes where the other artists have time to sit back digest the music before coming up with impressive alternate versions it also helps the two of the best men for the job are involved audion and james holden perhaps somebody should lock them in a room together and hit the record button
in 2010 established themselves as world-class electronic tinkerers with crooks lovers their debut full-length a shambolic yet highly efficient fusion of bass indie rock r b more experimental fare the album didnt sound like much else which helped it strike a chord across different music scenes the easy-going feel of kai campos dominic makers early releases was a big part of what made them so appealing but the deft compositional sense that underpinned it was what made the sound work crooks lovers was a mess but meticulously so s follow-up mostly maintains its predecessors nonchalance sense something new at work beneath the surface though where the tracks on crooks lovers seemed held together by duct tape chewing gum their warp debut achieves wholeness through more conventional studio finesse which at first can make it feel less exciting if you came for another high-wire act might not hold your attention that said in a way the more slickly engineered compositions suit quite well cold spring has some unexpected deeply appealing moments of musical clarity such as on when an extended passage of murky ambience breaks apart in its final minute to reveal a wholly un-electronic guitar groove rather than smash these seemingly incompatible textures together let them complement each other from opposite ends of the song the prickly beat cooing keyboards on make for an odder coupling but the tension this creates testifies to a newfound musicality in the groups sound when cold spring is at its best you dont really miss the danger of their earlier work but you sense are still finding their way with that musicality two of the albums best songs r ne are unfortunately sullied by the presence of a gravelly vocalist too timid to be rapping too melodically bl to be singing he doesnt live within the music so much as walk all over it smudging the finer points obscuring its craft and some of the groups own vocal lines like the overstuffed one on opener feel rhythmically melodically clumsy occasionally the music itself doesnt quite live up to its own potential on s flirt with jammy indie rock while and shaves its groove down into something overly simplistic plunking while cold spring is in many ways a massive leap forward for its also the sort of transitional album you might expect from a group with a knockout debut have got some growing to do but theres every reason to think theyll get there
though his 12-inches have often explored the blander side of functionality s 2009 debut lp 1984 was an agonizing outpouring of intensely personal emotion on 1984 perez seemed to attempt any facet of drum bass music he could imagine his contemporary mixes and live sets have been just as diverse effortlessly entwining disparate strands into a cohesive coherent line ll of this makes the ep perezs proper follow-up to 1984 slightly confusing like much of his single output these tracks seem concerned more with utility than artful expression on the album perez collaborated with hip-hop group foreign eggars for the evil wu-tang-evoking the ut eepens a partnership he reprises here for the militancy of the halting beat is impressive in itself but foreign eggars are on autopilot their braggadocio ringing hollow theres another collaboration in the form of ; noisia arguably the biggest names in d b outside of pendulum dont do much to bring out the adventurer in perez instead sticking to their own mostly uninteresting blend of obnoxious basslines and monochrome percussion the one remnant of the restless spirit of 1984 is ehind which adorns the tough beats with delicate synth trills and obscured vocal moans 1984 seemed like a leap forward for perez so i cant help but be disappointed that perez seems to be moving in such an overly masculine aggressive direction hopefully is merely a stopgap on the road to further progression
truss and tessela two brothers who make different kinds of techno share a love of the uks rave and hardcore history the duos project homes in on that history and when the two collaborate they make music thats more flamboyant and colourful than their solo productions the pairs first record as showed flashes of brilliance through fragmented songs and left turns its sequel presents full tracks that throw caution to the wind while embracing the duos nostalgic tendencies since the last arla record dropped a mini-mix called water the planets there a distinctive sound vintage drums and frilly melodies began to crystallize the mix ended with which also closes its s best track where a hands-in-the-air melody halfway between hardstyle and trance billows past bounding drums highlights the duos strength theyre not just making hardcore pastiche but drawing upon a lifetime of musical experience their music sounds idiosyncratic even when its touching on something universal the rest of the record is stranger walks the line between rave and happy hardcore with cutesy vocal samples a zany breaks track equal parts playful and heavy shakes things up even more the childlike vocals on might be off-putting but the tracks tribal techno beats are irresistible especially once the kick drum gets reinforced halfway through there are two short interludes including the floaty drone of that show off other ideas they feel like palate cleansers for the more fleshed-out songs rather than a quirky side project sounds like a full endeavour with a bright future
janus co-founder dan denorch once described his collectives music as a sound that doesn t exist as m e s h james whipple is arguably that sounds leading exponent scythians his debut ep for was futuristic dark and thrilling its close to some of arcas experiments with pop signifiers but its messier more comfortable in its state of flux and happy to remain unresolved arcas work is regularly beautiful; whipples music though grand and sometimes sublime is rarely so on sounds grind their way forward exploding briefly into vicious motion before snapping back towards stasis nothing proceeds in any single direction for long sounds are epic in scale laboriously layered and built up into towering oscillating edifices on tracks like and rhythm leads the way; metallic stabs battling each other into a tenuous sort of coherence glimpses of light-footed melody appear through the fray masked and damaged by the frantic percussion se more energetic tracks are exceptions to the general atmosphere floats in desolation before its thick cloud of reverberant noise is punctured by plucked strings all poise and melancholy closing pair of tracks imbi and are deeply rhythmic but they dont feel driven forward by those drums instead the drums become part of each tracks texture just another element of the sound design to appreciate record invites this kind of sensuous approach allowing the confusing frenzy of the arrangements to disperse on repeat listens into discrete bewitching sounds whipple has said that was partly inspired by the way information emerged from the uprising in ukraine last year multiple feeds none particularly definitive appear out of a war zone available to onlookers thousands of miles away televised newscasts webcam streams tweets newspaper reports and videos shot on soldiers phones this wave of information full of asynchronous events and conflicting narratives is reflected in the way whipple constructs his tracks albums 30 minutes unfold without a central guiding pulse it is an unreal perspective of multiple events taking place at once impossible to maintain without the manipulative potential of digital technology this is the sound that doesn t exist; it is composited fake knowingly constructed out of a thousand bits and pieces of information all fighting for space focuses on questions of perception: what does it feel like to be alive in a digital age overloaded and confused but excited too what perspectives are possible now is a captivating attempt at putting those feelings into sound
the next release on sex on wax comes from as they add 2 more chunky house tracks to the labels impressive discography first up is red army and it bangs its way in from the word go with some dark rumbling undertones some nice melodic overtones ring throughout but the track for most part remains a deep and dark stormer not as dark on the flip is evolver which begins with some delicate drums for the big part of the intro before a big kick moves in and sends it into 2nd gear the track halts unleashing a nice building breakdown that gives it a nice progressive edge before the beats come in and send the track to its peak a pretty good release from that should lead nicely into 16b s forthcoming release on the label
given he named himself after the san fernando valley where he grew up you could say is invested in his surroundings many of his releases are concerned with suburban life (one was even recorded in a starbucks) excerpts from a longer tape released a few years ago also references the region of los angeles: 818 is the telephone area code that covers most of the sfv if you havent been to the san fernando valley imagine everything you already associate with la but on steroids sprawling flat and hot the horizon never seems to end and everywhere you look theres another low-rise block and another strip mall its an alienating yet oddly dreamy place two qualities that come through in s work including a groovy house track with odd chords that whoosh and widen like shadows passing overhead for a producer whose work is often defined by its strangeness is remarkably straightforward another precocious house track with squiggly synths and a roving acid bassline shortest track lingers the longest is a breezy m lange of la tropes from the low-slung d m-funk rhythm to the whining g-funk lead finished off with what else a splash of 303 packing a lot into two minutes without sounding dense it feels like cruising down ventura boulevard seeing almost nothing of note but still enjoying the ride
announced his retirement from music in 2014 it looked like one of detroit technos most unorthodox talents was withdrawing from the scene dixon has made some of the most beautiful and strange music the genres ever known his minimal jazz-inspired creations surely the result of an instinctive and improvisational approach n the last three years his music has continued to emerge regularly hes appeared on compilations for tresor and trip last month he released an excellent ep like a thief n night hes put out several albums most recent lp is the most substantial in the 23 years hes been releasing music for most techno artists releasing a 21-track 80-minute album with a loose space theme would be an unwise move in space travel after all is a techno clich but dixon has never seemed too concerned about following conventional wisdom and hes crafted an album thats absorbing from the moment the frantic snares thunder in on the opening track n typical dixon fashion some tracks like n finish precisely where they started and ncomplete are classic dixon too full of disorienting swirls off-time hats and bass tones that seem to do whatever the hell they want but not even dixons deep well of ideas can prevent the album from sagging is difficult to digest in one sitting and some tracks slip down the cracks between useful dj tool and expressive experimental music but then something unique or startling will emerge the spooky say which follows two fairly forgettable tunes other tracks like the seductive lantic the drum workouts and the heavily filtered or the memorably bizarre title track could only have come from the mind of f nothing else his non-retirement provided us with a jolting reminder of his artistry were lucky to have him
luke chable and nubreed under their dirty fours guise combine to deliver the 2nd release on luke s imprint by the name of chable s yellow remix is first up and i must say that this remix showcases why luke is undeniably one of the finer producers in progressive music the track builds delightfully with some intricate percussive elements as well as some beautiful subtle melodies and tasty baselines the main breakdown features some nice melodies over smooth strings and it soon kicks back into gear with some smooth baselines and then hits its peak as all the elements meet the nubreed remix has a tasty progressive breaks feel to it thanks to some nicely paced break beats and smooth warm melodies that flow delightfully throughout it s a solid remix from nubreed that compliments the a-side very well and adds to strong second release for the label
larry heard is the reason why i bought my first studio equipment back in 1988 gushed on soundcloud when he posted a preview of heards remix of recently give a listen to any of s releases from the last few years many of which had gone unreleased for far too long and you wont have too tough a time hearing heards influence on his distinctly breezy house sound originally released a bit earlier this fall backed with a remix from serge tyrell is one of s more hypnotic heads-down compositions so heard was actually a rather brilliant choice of remixer for the tune: more than most releases was ripe to have that ineffable heard-ness squeezed out of it the chicago house godfather gives the original a good back rub loosening out the tension and exposing the song within where the original felt like it might tear you apart eventually heards version sounds like it could go on forever the 12-inch comes with both a vocal and a more abstract dub version the former certainly winning the day for most deetron meanwhile doesnt forsake the originals intensity on either of his flipside versions which blend s forward motion with the remixers big synths its not a bad look but itll be tough to take this out of your bag and not place heards take face-up on the platter
this track is absolutely amazing from the moment it opens the detailed production shines through the vocals are crisp and enchanting the sound is deep hypnotic and spine tingling think foremost poets meets placebo and youll see what i mean junior have just released a four piece promo pack containing the original tech-house hook the thumping bongaloid vocal mix and dub and the watkins tranquility bass remix - which is by and far my pick of the bunch check it out
dont let the echocord logo fool you nick h ppner isnt making dub techno here though it is rather unusual to see the ostgut ton manager outside of his own home the music here is tougher than his recent plush house productions seaweed reminds of his panorama ar mix from earlier this year: its got a hesitant brushed house pulse at its core but a deceptively techno thrust lying underneath its all monochrome click and portentous chords until about five minutes in when an upswell of big rounded synths swallows the track whole shooting it off into another sphere entirely fellow erliner deadbeat takes to the stems with a rework subtitled and like the title might suggest its a roaring beast in all the places that the original exhibited h ppners typically calm deference thrown off balance seaweed suddenly sounds like a factory full of pistons and steam-powered machines offset by stabby chords that scrape the surface before being swept up by its insistent hi-hats
re is a lot to be said about longevity especially in the dance music world on one hand it can be synonymous with experience and commanding artistry; on the other it can also be associated with staleness in that regard s fourth studio album the blandly titled more might suggest the superfluous addition of new material to an imposing but uneven body of work an impression that is only enhanced by the anything-will-do nature of the artwork in other words one wonders if they have started to truly run out of ideas se peripheral extra musical details shouldnt detract anyone from the fact are still a genuinely relevant venture and more a satisfying return to form right from the start havana imposes a more playful vibe than on their last offerings with the kind of mischievous synths you usually find on dirtybird releases: musically it does the kind of seedy deeds the very title evokes and its a humorous move that suits arno and walter quite well their most recent collaboration with fellow get physical chums m a n d y might have been overlooked when it was released as a single a few months ago lets face it its no body language part 2 but in its shorter tighter form its charm is obvious and are the albums two instrumental zeniths former titillates for three whole minutes before a buzzing electronic pad kicks in to full venting effect a la in white rooms while the later opts for subdued captivating tones instead of taking charge of the singing themselves like they did with watery results on sun neon light have also recruited r jones and yellos dieter meier on vocal duties jones voice is an acquired taste both soulful and sometimes jarring that said its hard to deny the fact he has the kind of timeless presence we used to find on vintage chicago house cuts: his performance on has a reverential warmth if slightly affected and overdone meier is an even more daring choice but its a redemption-inducing one with the help of fellow yello member/oddball boris blank the swiss maestros bring their darker edge to creating a spooky slice of electro pop that isnt that far away from their own crash dance it seems most people experience s music through their relentless touring nowadays and this new album has obviously been designed with its live show in mind (its their bounciest meatiest most upfront release since movements ) even with this obvious focus however its a surprisingly dependable album from a duo that still knows how to cover new ground even if that ground is in their own backyard

using facial prosthetics androgynous vocals and leftfield electronics to make her point berlin-based jam (formerly janine) rostron is on a mission to question traditional notions of gender and sexuality you may not completely agree with everything she has to say and as titles like and suggest her arguments are advanced to the level of catchy critical theory sloganeering but she is nonetheless an exhilarating presence both musically and politically s is more direct and pop-oriented than s last album w it has hooks galore but embedded in brilliantly strange music a kind of lo-fi european ravers take on us r b (one of ras top 50 tracks of 2013 ) is impossible to categorise the pleasantly pummelling techno of whose quirky perky demeanour recalls trombone-toting duo die vogel is just a simple remix away from being a floor-ready bomb like the knife with whom she has collaborated rostron loves 80s yamaha synths their reedy keys synthetic pianos and parps of fake brass and she squeezes a lot of tonal variety from that sound palette with its pizzicato strings courtly precision and breathless ruminations on liquid sexuality recalls patrick wolfs melodramatic pop meanwhile and lets fuse elements of vintage disco 80s synth-pop and ze records eclecticism to create tracks that though relatively basic in terms of production are cleverly constructed and pack a surprising emotional punch this is protest music that flashes with anger but look at that title again it is also an album about love

is an unusual record but it doesnt exist in a vacuum max loderbauer who recorded it with ricardo villalobos made an album last year called ambiq ; he also played on sounding lines the most recent moritz von oswald trio lp all three records come from the same pocket of the german techno avant-garde all three balance live instrumentation and distilled electronics and recall jazz in their fluid intuitive structures but where those other efforts fell flat is considerably better perhaps this is down to the chemistry between its two collaborators villalobos and loderbauer have worked together extensively remixing everyone from nightmares on wax to neneh cherry and re-versioning a chunk of the ecm catalogue for 2011s re:ecm connecting all of this work is the use of pre-existing source material the duo tweak embellish or radically reframe but their subtle exquisitely strange electronics always rest on a foundation of somebody elses music on the duos first full-length of original material that foundation is removed this steers them towards the airless spaces of villaloboss solo work though with loderbauer in tow the minimal pioneer seems willing to venture further into the unknown follows the duos other original release 2013s turbo sematic ep right down to the queasy monologue in opener the source this time is the between-song banter from a concert recording of the jazz quartet reflecting the duos love of jazz although repitched to a chipmunk squeak over a wobbly downtempo groove its use hardly seems reverential the rest of the album is equally weird: the beats are swampy and unstable while the mid- and hi-range teems with minutely sculpted details only surmasky hints at the firmer techno chassis that underpins many of villaloboss solo productions elsewhere we float free this respect from is like its partner albums audophiles music sheer sonic pleasure often seems to be the main goal crucial musical details are buried deep in the mix waiting for keen ears to pick them out its easy to imagine the duo hunched in front of villaloboss spectacular martion horns enjoying a sonic experience that few in their audience can hope to replicate but unlike sounding lines never fully retreats into this inaccessible world the title track ten minutes of densely woven micro-rhythms is punctuated by subtle rhodes-like chords which function as waymarkers in the labyrinth similar chords surface across the album giving it a surprisingly noir-ish tone theyre present even when the duo venture furthest out on whose tumbling dialogue between synths and live drums is the records most original moment as its title suggests is the sound of two experienced artists firmly ensconced in their own world fortunately for us theyve made some accommodation for visitors
earlier this summer uk label goon club allstars dropped a bomb with the rudeboyz ep showcasing the young gqom scene in durban south africa the release coincided with a flurry of interest in the sound including one hell of a mix in oh we now have a label dedicated to the explosive style named after an onomatopoeic word gqom iz da sound u get wen u drop a rock on tiles as the label puts it the genre is endearingly rough like some mongrel hybrid of kwaito and uk funky the sound of durban ep precedes a full length comp offering the coastal citys best and judging from these three tunes its sure to be a rawer take on the sound than the goon club 12 inch though percussion samples are a key part of gqom these three tracks place even more emphasis on borrowing each based around a well known pop song (an approach that mirrors some early footwork) they all follow the same formula: ride a chopped up sample for minutes of thunderous repetition let it unspool into a breakdown that reveals the full song then pull it back together to hammer on for a few more minutes on the sound of durban this process offers three results that vary in mood but theyre united by the same ominous melodies and slamming drums on s adeles yelps gradually disperse into a delay drenched breakdown where the songs already immense power is made to sound impossibly epic and portentous the terse strings on zs a rework of a ap ferg add a strained sort of paranoia to gqom only by z feels slightly underdone letting its busta rhymes rap go on for too long and losing some crucial momentum in the process though a bit simpler than rudeboyz or menchess productions these three tracks muster up a hulking sound out of very few elements and they do it without coming off macho or alienating an achievement on its own
is a dj/producer of ish origin who runs a party called family affairs in basel switzerland the relationship between him and began when the latter played at his club some time ago aslan eventually released a couple of tracks through the h+p sublabel highlife is his first full release and its a superb realisation of aslans stated aim to blend traditional ish music with house and techno a propulsive bassline and distant cowbells give the title track (which is a rework of a cut by the romanian band a housey spine while various intoxicating horn ribbons oscillate in the foreground its a natural-sounding and simple melding of styles that evokes some of the best moments on the acid arab album and are equally well executed the former turns its horns into a huge panorama bar-slaying bass groove with clacking percussion big chords and a countdown vocal completing the scene the latter is a frenetic yet luxuriant blend of urgent bass ping-pong percussion and heavenly pads prior to recording these tracks aslan apparently feared that he couldnt make this meeting of styles work on the dance floor with hes proved himself wrong three times
as continue their evolution (not devolution as the naysayers claim) from club dominators to ethereal movie soundtrack maestros it is getting harder and harder for fans to find anthems in the vein of push upstairs or born slippy to clutch to their chests in private moments at home like previous single crocodile is one of the more danceable cuts on oblivion with bells but it is still more slow-burning than hip-shaking both tiefschwarz and pig address the situation somewhat amping up the stark desolation of the original with their remixes pig s remix is suitably cocoon-esque looping vocal snippets and sparkling bleepy melodies to kick the track into high gear at around the midway point it sounds exactly how you would imagine a p d remix of would but nonetheless it s a decent big-room banger tiefschwarz s effort is more subtle replacing the bleakness of the original with funkiness it s still dark but its a more heated darkness akin to a tropical night with congas and heavily delayed melodies intertwining with hydes vocals a low-slung tech houser with a kicking bridge that should raise some hands both remixes utilize production touches: lush padwork and the looping hypnotic vocal style of cowgirl its a nice amalgamation of remixer and producer and both units are fairly represented in the end
s schtick stripped-back club tracks made with minimal fuss is by now well established with all-caps track titles and endlessly repeating dance floor mantras thug houz anthems vol 4 a pretty self-explanatory series that began in 2013 gathers four more of his bumping oversexed ghetto house jams along with metal-detector synth wails muggy bass groove and vocal loops only has any hint of the acid that haus often deals in is a more jagged slightly less enjoyable iteration of the opener its sledgehammer bass stomp and metallic keys battling for attention with another repetitious vocal the last two tracks are more fleshed-out but still utilitarian with an infectious sax riff ducking under and over brickbat snares and fragments of a soulful female vocal is the pick of the ep is louder and more gritty though its lascivious come-ons are the eps smoothest sample at a time when producers regularly turn out raw club tracks continues to be ahead of the pack

well-received eps for futureboogie and sonar kollektiv under their belts former underworld man darren emerson and vocalist peter josefs project is gradually gaining momentum this release hotflushs first of should garner more positive attention is a bluesy vocal house slow-burner thats reminiscent of death in vegas steady drums and deliberate bass are the bed for josefs louche vocal around which acid-leaning wisps of synth gradually begin to crackle and twist its a richly atmospheric piece aimed more at home listening than the dance floor the two remixes offer differing but similarly floor-friendly interpretations italojohnson speed up elements of the vocal and add punchy snares and glowing house keys mike s rework is far starker he takes a bed of flinty percussion (and not much else) and lays echoing excerpts from the vocal across it both will be of use to djs but neither stands out as especially inspired closing the package is emersons extravaganza version which stretches past the ten-minute mark in a hyper-linear sweep of driving bass claps and glistening vocal snippets
the djs love themselves some and its not hard to see why frank heinrichs tracks are exceptional in the mix relentless grooves that introduce their wares slowly and surely awaiting another track to take them elsewhere heinrich doesnt build monuments he builds bridges nd theres nothing wrong with that: one need only look at rooklyn ridge to know theres plenty of art in those too the b-side to oots debut 12-inch on cocoon works within this framework building a steady groove that adds and subtracts with aplomb taking in plenty of elements throughout before the kick drum arrives the bassline slides in and everything glides along effortlessly like his last few 12-inches its nothing special to the home listeners ears but presumably the jocks will find use for it when theyve run out of options of how to get from to c this being cocoon and all though the side is the track worth attending to listening to for the first time i was struck immediately by how typical it was the thought process went a little something like this: h yes the kick right the bassline oh hm well then those last three moments started occurring right around the midway point of the tune where heinrich somehow slowly introduced siren and then started to increase the pace from there is no bridge unless its a bridge that climbs directly into the sky and never bothers to come back down its self-consciously big and his best since charlotte
is a comparatively young genre but there are already a number of distinct styles developing within it output is broadly on the thoughtful musical side its roster of artists is less interested in impressing dance floors with killer bass drops than they are with creating mood and atmosphere ranking releases tend to give a sense of moving from one place to another the second half of the track is not the same as the first and the music is often highly detailed and ornamented is a spacious track with a careful precise rhythm thats chilled out while still having a pleasant rolling feel the bass is weighty of course but its also unassuming like a deep earthly pulse thats dimly felt but never indecently exposed the track is the work of three producers and which perhaps explains the sense of inner contrast the tune has an expansive quality like a natural landscape containing light and shade in equal measure if theres one thing lacks though its a compelling hook this is not true of the flipside ll which features a looping vocal sample thats both gently hypnotic and teasingly funky its dubstep but it feels more refined than what usually goes by that name think soft pads understated synth sounds and above all groove and here demonstrate a deft touch and an ear for a dope rhythm theres a real sense of movement depth and smoothness qualities the rest of the scene would do well to emulate
et tu liebe*detail on the sublabel of one of hamburgs finest two northern german producers matthias meyer and patlac go south down to mannheim to take lessons in sounds from the deep house contingent currently ruling the dj charts worldwide or so it would seem at least from that rolling drum programming that youll hear on an ode to l neburg a city near hamburg and its long history of salt mining that continued until the early 80s while the track isnt quite as desolate as the l neburg heath an area that was devastated to due to the salt trade and is now a nature reserve it nonetheless evokes a sense of space throughout its eight minutes via the dub bubbles that float to the surface and the see-saw syncopated bassline by its end though those open spaces turn into claustrophobia as synths crash into one another fighting to breathe its only in nick s remix that things sort themselves out surely one of the more underrated producers of the year tosses into the 8bit bounce template and lets the track ride assured and needing little help like the best of his work it sounds less like a track that built and more like one that he simply came upon easing elements in and out of a comfortable framework that has existed for ages is more successful for the duo not least because it has congas (or percussion that sounds suspiciously like it) a surefire recipe these days it glides more easily than an uncluttered riposte to its predecessor nytime youre going to bring in moaning strings that hold a chord for what seems like forever doesnt hurt either something that meyer and patlac do for the last-half of the track if was the slightly fidgety (but talented ) son tamed by is the self-assured older brother
s label moods grooves has been a staple of detroits house scene for nearly 20 years but some of the best tracks its ever released are remixes by a uk artist: colin mcbean aka mr g with its rolling strings and snippets of maya angelous still i rise mcbeans theres hope mix of s the struggle of people is a bona fide classic lesser known but no less essential is his mix of s a sought after house gem that resurfaced this month on moods grooves classics v5 (mr gs has a lot in common with the struggle of people (mr gs theres hope namely breezy strings a locomotive rhythm (mcbeans trademark) and vocal samples about standing up in the face of adversity this time coming from someone less conventionally poetic than angelou: yeah its fucked up but i dont have to live like this im gonna take my destiny into my own hands its a pretty unbeatable arrangement: the drums are slamming the melody genuinely uplifting and the vocals lend it all some swagger on the b side s originally released in 2001 is less special but still holds its own raw stuttering and clearly played live it shows s style of rough edged sample collage early in its development though far more understated than the soaring it deserves its place in moods grooves classics series

jess gentile has taken almost two years to follow up pop it her debut ep for is a more complete and confident-sounding release than its predecessor and speaks to the competing influences of where shes from (miami) and where she lives (new york) right down to the opening track being named after the highway that connects the two cities in its skittering percussion and looping chants owes much to miami bass friends of friends dj salva remixes parachuting the originals vocals into a pounding hail of tough drums and raygun flashes of synth ashrock s remix of is a pleasant contrast its muted kicks and sleepy pads inching forward in considered fashion with none of the frenzied urgency of salvas rework the title track feels almost low-key after its predecessors with more female vocal loops and whoops pairing with understated bass and alarm clock bleeps
the man behind rob smith is a bit of a legend round these parts his work with peter d rose and ray mighty under the respective more rockers and smith mighty banners have been wooing bass heads since the late 80s and marks his second release for tom peverelist fords much lauded imprint whereas his first 12-inch was a slice of dancefloor smashing post-junglism smith finds himself in a much more resolutely dubstep mode for these two tracks albeit with a heavy nod to classic dub reggae sounds rolls out of the blocks with some laid back skanking chords before launching into a heavy bassline that underpins the proceedings lthough it seems deceptively simple on first listen there are some really interesting things going on underneath the hood listen for smiths fierce modulation of the bassline or the majestic offbeat drop near the tracks end ox is the more musical of the two efforts possessing a bubbling filtered piano loop skittering drums and a catchy bassline that errs just on the right side of wobble throw in some electronic pulses echoed siren and a jazzy break that comes out of nowhere and youve got a heads-down belter for the more discerning dubstep floors you might want to look elsewhere if youre looking for the more techno influenced material that the label has put out (see pinch and peverelists contributions) but if youre after some bass heavy cuts to appeal to the steppers in the crowd you could do a lot worse than adding these two bottom-end bangers to your box
had some minor success in the 70s penning music for soul icons like johnny bristol in 1980 he signed to the major label mca but his debut single languished due to a lack of promotion and distribution fast forward 35 years and french record collector has attempted to rectify the poor decisions of the past by reissuing the single is well placed to do so he has a reputation for delving into the dustiest nooks of soul music with a speciality among other things in obscure jamaican disco his recent release on golf channel a re-edited reggae version of surfaces boogie classic falling in love was indicative of his deep disco-nerd credentials here re-edits but in truth he doesnt do more than extend a few sections which is absolutely the right approach the original has a steamy vocal and seriously funky instrumentation that would only be spoilt by over manipulation is a solid temptations-esque up-tempo soul number but is where the real heat is there are probably too many disco reissues nowadays but when theyre this good its hard to complain
the 6th release on comes from new york based producer andres aljaste under the alias of the release is and it s an intense piece of music that is sure to disrupt the normal flow of a few dancefloors around the world on the a-side is the original mix the track begins with some deliciously produced tribal drums the highlight of this production is the way it builds firstly introducing layers of percussion and then following this with sound effects that build on each other like a high rise building as the track builds to its peak it takes a big rest deep where the drums subside for a few moments soon enough it all meets again taking the production to its conclusion intense tribal work here on the flip is chris sulu s dark metropolis mix the remix maintains the intense feel early on but it lacks the quality drum arrangements that the original maintained screeching effects are used while the dark sounds keep this production a little evil a very solid production that will excite those that love the rawness of music already charted on the us based balance charts this is a production that won t go unnoticed

s fourth album begins with a dubstep track in this shouldnt come as much of a surprise but what is a surprise is the techstep veterans sudden devotion to the genre though its becoming increasingly standard for drum bass producers to explore the lower tempo realms of dubstep usually its an excuse to unleash excessively wobbly and obnoxious midrange basslines an extension of the maligned jump up sector of drum bass re are a small number of names doing it differently acts that treat dubstep as an outlet for more reflective and deliberate material calibre and icicle for instance have been making dubstep tracks that act as downtempo distillations of their restless energies its from this angle that the dutch trio approach dubstep on lights wires they dont just flirt with the genre they embrace it instead of a few tokens exactly half of the albums sixteen tracks are at dubstep tempo its sequencing alternates back and forth between dubstep and drum bass initially it lends the album a fraught unfocused feeling throwing the listener recklessly between extremes just as one slides into a dubstep groove the album slams straight into a wall of ferocious neurofunk fortunately after a few listens it smooths out into a surprisingly natural give and take ride is interrupted only when tracks seem to end prematurely as on the gorgeously spacious dubstep of which suddenly cuts out after only two minutes and is followed immediately by the albums most frenetic workout way approach dubstep is refreshing: sometimes it carries the signature of their own particular brand of techstep as on stunning opener which channels the impact of its kick drums into quaking midrange basslines or on its the reflective place of rest between relentless thrashing on the drum bass side of things have perhaps controversially but i only see it as a positive slightly subdued their straightforward bangers re is still the familiar mix of distorted stabby basslines and deafening drums as usual but this time they sound more careful more mature more silence they leave in between beats allows more room for delicate detail and it adds an entirely new dimension to their otherwise permanently screwfaced d b track lengths are thankfully reined in lending the albums cohesion another strong point: its a long album regardless but easier to digest as a result lights wires offers a much needed starting point for dubstep listeners wanting to get into drum bass (an angle which is usually reversed) and while the dubstep tracks are sometimes reduced to pseudo interludes theyre proficient enough to capture the hearts of diehards as drum bass is split wide open by its more progressive sectors insular neurofunk names like need to evolve or they will die transitional stages are never easy but lights wires is an admirable effort and the beginning of a promising process

has been a consistant producer for many years now and is one of the many talented music makers from turkey and after giving only recordings the superb rain man he now lands on for single gun is at his very best blending tough techy grooves and lush melodies and of course his trademark production which is always good for the original mix takes us on a journey building the track up from a simple sound before bringing in the drums and 4-4 rhythm then adding a typical funky bassline with pads and uplifting synths that just wash over you this is at his very best a real summer tune full of feal good vibes on the flip s solid mix replaces the 4-4 with a breakbeat and brings the synths more to the fore this mix has already had the distinction of being featured on steve gerrards thinking out loud comp so quality is guaranteed overall this is another very strong release from whom is still delivering the goods and is proof that along with muzo and yunus the turks are still the masters when it comes to producing great music
djulz is hardly a new name he s been a stalwart of the french underground for many a year with releases on 20/20 vision and ovum amongst others to show for it as a dj djulz treads a similar path to poker flat boss steve bug specialising in an erudite techy deepness laced with tracks that follow a common thread whether they be house or techno as a recording artist he tends to follow the same blueprint however this is a disappointing effort from the frenchman okay good djs dont always make great producers and vice-versa but djulz is capable of greatness as acid tricks on ovum proved here though the title track never really gets going and while it would make reasonable mixing fodder its difficult to see it standing out in its own right theres a pounding hi-hat and some linear percussion combined with an undulating rob hood-like symphonic backdrop sounds good on paper but in practice it is lacking in variety and although it picks up a bit after the four minute mark things soon descend once more into ordinariness and the track ends with a whimper the and remix is slightly better adding a bit of syncopation where little existed before it dubs the track out and makes a little more space between the bars theres a retro tinge to this remix which although slightly cliched in itself is definitely an improvement on the bland original its left to to try and rescue this package a task which it falls short of following in the footsteps of its a seven minute exercise in ordinariness djulz and poker flat have set themselves exceedingly high standards as stated before these tracks could probably merge with others to create something atmospheric and special when needed but under closer scrutiny they fail to deliver

is it just me or is kind of everywhere this year a slew of remixes have been piling up on the young producers rapidly growing cv and his latest feature release comes on small detroit based kolour both tracks here retain the vintage atmosphere that has been cultivating in the last few years now pounding with a weighty ferocity that feels brand new goma might be deep house down to the core featuring a larger than life drum machine pulse but it seems to cherry pick from uk bass music in its emphasis on dominating sub bass and incomprehensibly processed vocals it really should be a mess as chromatic chords and swooning strings duel with a mangled acoustic guitar sample but the final product is infectious despite its complexity dimming the lights slow burner you are than clings to a filtered loop of vibe heavy jazz and builds a lumbering and sexy (now theres a combination) slow jam around it including more of those half understandable speech snippets the dipping drum hits and sultry strings add to the seductive mood and it shares the same irreverent spirit of modernity via retrospection as its flipside the package also adds two synth heavy remixes that cover both tracks in a futuristic sheen san s remix of goma brings it into reassuring territory with a warm and fuzzy bassline working on the same tip mano s rework of sends the track floating on trilling arpeggios and wafting piano chords
disco is as strong as ever in the big apple with entities like discovery and lets play house holding down the fort the renault run lph labels eighth release is a various artists label sampler that doubles as a mini manifesto for the club night the affair kicks off with mysterious london edit master whose is another flippant display of deft sample flipping endowing an ecstatic disco sample with a housey oomph he lets the strings freewheel through the track; going easy on the filters and the compression means his edit has more life than most new york local chooses to build a track from the ground up the jiggly bottom heavy which oozes melody via oscillating arpeggios before a splashy but subdued acid line makes everything a bit wetter uk hot streaking duo again show their effortless ability to make retro house sound glossy and modern setting pillbox drum machines against a luxurious backdrop of gently lolling chords brooklyn group are the odd ones out here: their horn heavy fanfare and sensually bounding basslines feel unusually lifelike placed next to the drum machines of the others but with its bulky hercules love affair arrangement and enthusiastic vocal it works anyways

s love devotion might have been a response to the various 80s-referencing pop movements of the past decade its soft-focus re-imaginings of omd fleetwood mac and vintage house werent so far from chillwave and the duo have professed an admiration for the likes of toro y moi but compared to many young nostalgists the music of mike paradinas and lara rix-martin felt more richly textured its influences more sensitively handled a product perhaps of experience boss paradinas is a veteran producer but also of the involvement of warp singer gravenhurst who brought a downcast and distinctively british hue to four of the albums eight tracks gravenhurst is absent on the albums follow-up single replaced by the lesser-known whose fragile falsetto last heard on his 2011 lyre ep for mu cleaves much closer to the 00s bedroom-pop norm his stargazing is a good match for this swooning synth ballad and in some respects the results are lovely but like many chillwavers his delivery lacks conviction a shortcoming that no digital processing can remedy (those who find the whole thing too frustrating might get along better with the instrumental mix ) single is rounded off with a pair of nice-enough vocal-less numbers is propelled by a slow-house beat and the distant diva wail that seems to have become s signature; is moody electro with a redemptive edge both are in standard style eye-wateringly glossy though they fall short of love devotion s finest moments
for an artist of his standing efdemin takes a pretty casual approach to his label na f: once every year or so he quietly drops another rubber stamped 12 inch often to little fanfare and with seemingly no criteria beyond his own taste as a dj the result has been a series of classy and effective club records from a hodgepodge of esteemed producers along with the occasional up and comer nina kraviz released one of her earliest tracks on na f in 2009 last year the young new yorker gave us overcomplete an acid stomper that might be na fs biggest track yet returns on n if 07 though the main selling point is an old tune: patric raddatzs reshape of s a tech house earworm from 1999 that might sound familiar even if you dont know it by name fierce and punchy with a bubbling acid line and a melody that screams sleep deprivation its an addictive banger well worth dusting off (though for what its worth the original pressing is cheaply and available) delivers a trickier club tool is a fast and slamming techno track full of spastik style drum fills with the bold tempo of 140 pm its unlikely to get rinsed the way overcomplete was but youd be lucky to find yourself at any party that calls for something this serious
five years in and enigmatic berlin label sued has started to look like a fascinating study in opposing forces you have svn the former punk who barely engages with dance music; and then theres co-founder sw whose practice is far more nostalgic with his superb reminder series looking back to classic detroit chicago and uk productions freaks have a way of sniffing each other out and theres a porous feel permeating sued and closely related outposts sex tags and acido the founder of the latter label dynamo dreesen is on board for sueds 13th release as are svn and arch bassbin deconstructionist dave huismans aka a made up sound its the second 12-inch from this trio following a 2015 acido record and it sees them exploring unruly dubby percussive jams that fit into a tradition spanning back to the d sseldorf school is a solid off-kilter house cut the trio keeps things under boil with an insistent three-note bassline which serves as the backbone for playful experiments and sets the stage for the b-sides world of echo b1 evokes dj sotofetts low-key drop for fit sound tribute to sore fingers in the way it goes for dubbed-out psychedelia fueled by clattering hand drums the nearly eight-minute jam is intensely melodic but theres nary a synth or bassline to be found instead each shaker tom whistle and bell serves a dual purpose theres a subtle tonal quality that allows the trio to build a wall of nuanced melody out of percussion around the five-minute mark someone starts tweaking the roland re-201 an effect that could be disorienting under the right circumstances b2 begins with queasy arpeggios a martial half-step and a creepy bassline thats eventually swapped out for a relaxed pad switching the mood like the first hues of purple dawn though the a-side treads closer to modern experimental dj fare the other cuts position these producers as heirs to the fried legacy of krautrock innovators like cluster and michael rother
s latest is according to his website the result of some myspace talent-spotting picked up these two tracks for release after hearing them on his player dont let that give you the impression that theyre knockoffs though the montreal native has turned in two extremely workable tracks dripping with funk and ready to ignite messier floors theres been a sudden surge in the popularity of like-minded work amongst labels such as floppy funk highgrade frankie and circus company to name but a few i call it tech-house even though id prefer not to twists and turns through a percussive tunnel with various congas bongos and what sounds like a west frican talking drum coming in and out of the mix to great effect the backbone of the track is a very simple shuffling groove perfectly adapted to accommodate a myriad of effects and filters no frills but funky and full of life the cut has a whimsical tone that reminds me of a slightly sped up rett johnson this is groovesome stripped down house of the highest order doesnt do much different and utilises some very similar sounds indeed listening to the two tracks consecutively there s just a subtle change in pitch and direction before momentum is gathered and were off on a ride once more albeit without drums this time in the end the track is a little bit rawer than with the shuffle sounding sharper and more abrasive and there are some nice effects and a nagging riff to carry us home oth tunes are tightly coiled springs of energy that will get the job done workmanlike they may be but well-executed tracks like these are quality carbohydrates for the floor

s tunes have always been about a quick snappy attack: bits of string sections compacted into wallops wedded with sinuous synth lines but on s title track which appears in three different vocal versions as well as an intro and outro everything is blown to larger-than-life proportions indeed aside from the six minute epic reinforced is simultaneously the loftiest thing hes ever made and maybe the most brutal best of all he doesnt lose any of his precision with the growing scale of his work divides the album up into sections and choosing a favourite version isnt easy provides a bellowing dancehall take while a trio that includes turn it into a posse cut but the strongest is probably the formers effortless flow eventually turns giddily vicious and you can practically feel the venom escaping from their snarling mouths anger and destruction isnt s sole mission however delivers a tender vocal over a tense tabla-tickled groove that has all the confidence and silk of her previous terror collaboration attention lekas previously-released also makes an appearance and the hints at terrors touted rhythm grime cleanse the palate amidst all the brutish bellicosity the meat in between those bones is pretty delectable as well terrors at his most adventurous here but his wandering mind is reined into tight constraints rather than the stylistic meandering of his first album undeniable he traverses full-throated funky with on and joker-style thwomp with on most interestingly theres a break-heavy tune that crosses a path into ninja tune territory but is still coated in terrors electrified barbed wire synth sounds theres even a bit of drum bass: has elastic snares finding surprising new life in a rhythmic straitjacket s relatively brief length stands in contrast with its mammoth predecessor thats a good thing sounds both hungry and wizened a producer eager to tackle new ideas but with the surety of someone who could knock out the best grime beat youve ever heard in an afternoon at times its an overwhelming wave of sound that quickly washes over you in a flurry of alarm calls and shuriken percussion but amidst all the flying debris and heart-stopping drama you have the most cohesive and powerful single statement from yet
it would be easy to lump in with art department and their label no 19 music: both are based in canada both started in 2008 both have on occasion released the same artists but while art department have increasingly wide appeal have always kept a narrow sonic scope so that in they are a reliable outlet for carefully crafted synth-heavy sounds with real personality an indie sensibility permeates their output not in the punk-funk way of say dfa but more in the moody songwriter style of a band like soft cell if you arent convinced just listen to their latest album released on no 19 music right away its clear something has changed since the trios last full-length we come in pieces where that was a rather jumbled collection of machine-driven tracks is a more coherent vision one that you imagine was never primarily concerned with the dance floor as such its a captivating listen that travels some distance without ever losing touch with s signature aesthetic that aesthetic is one of buffed metallic hues and muted stainless steels scuffed golden chords and widescreen vistas at times radiant synths rise up around you like shiny high-rises in an urban metropolis is a serious and insular affair: voytek korabs voice sounds tortured among the drawn-out and heat-damaged synth chords and there is a very real sense of finality in the air from start to finish but just when the dystopian vibe starts to feel too heavy we get some well-placed lighthearted moments such as with its playful hi-hats and languorous bassline on the whole korabs diamond-tipped tones perfectly match the mood of the music just once on he sounds a little too strained but the final track s finds him in top form suitably morose yet mildly optimistic just like the album itself
is a young label whose records conjure gritty graffiti-scrawled scenes the music a mix of breakbeat weird techno and beatdown house has unpolished textures and a rowdy impromptu spirit so far releases have mostly come from anonymous artists (alphonse the comedown) or those who tend to or low-key favourites (madteo) s third record presents two familiar names: franklin de costa and christopher rau is loaded with the styles of both artists it has de costas chaotic breaks and rhythms and raus deep cocoon-like atmospheres the way they come together feels energetic and on-the-fly the syncopated percussion on has the sound of trash-can drumming topped off by glam chords and bright noodly synths starts as a slog but turns beautiful burying its weighty low-end in celestial pads and chords the other tracks have a heavier kick is crooked techno with chunky rhythms hissy textures and a tumbling bassline pairs its blown-out drums with glistening machine melodies get messy but lands somewhere fresh
if noise and dance music make for happy bedfellows why not let musique concr te join in thats the question raised by the duo of electroacoustic composer giuseppe ielasi and giovanni civitenga the founder of the label and nts radio show civitenga has released with the likes of brainfeeder as my dry wet mess so youd think hed be the one bringing the beats to this project but theres really no parsing the roles here the compositional detail of comes as no surprise its full of precisely arranged sonic minutiae sometimes it has the specificity of foley effects (most musique concr te does) take the imagistic clatters of 2 : im not sure ive heard so many different kinds of percussion in one track before but it requires flair to take what some might view as dry compositional practices and move fluidly between academic ideas and compelling if still experimental beats as does tying that approach to the foggy after-hours hypnosis familiar to any experienced raver 3 does this well you might not hear any of s tracks in a club anytime soon but itd be a psychedelic twist if you did

while some labels celebrate anniversaries with extended eps jam-packed with remixes it says much about the us approach that it marks its 50th release with a one-tracker from call it confidence will sauls label have has seen a rich roster stride through its doors over the past seven years from midland to joy orbison to george fitzgerald pits fuzzy pads and sweet analogue vignettes against linn drum toms and fat bass stabs with a sparsely employed vocal sample sprinkled on top its towards the more soulful end of the swiss producers range but still has plenty of impact
in the summer of 2015 released one the most striking and immersive techno albums in recent memory june was a seamless nine-track narrative that moved fluidly between celestial ambient low-end hypnosis deep techno and banging warehouse fare only further carving out its rich sound with every layer record was best heard in its entirety but the unnamed swedish producer also included a few powerful standalone club tracks his latest release falls somewhere between an album and a double-ep with eight cuts that trade more in functionality than nuanced expression but within the format of two dj-friendly 12-inches has nonetheless struck an exceptional balance between dance floor dynamics and engrossing soundscapes is s second semantica record after 2014s yggdrasil like those four tracks this batch takes it easy with ghostly pads overt melody and the producers general tendency towards tuneful atmospherics what ambience is left is thick with humidity and sinister undertones sounds and moods heightened by illusory traces of synth ( ) or distant clattering rhythms ( ) if the music of entagled describes any kind of story its one of psychedelic shamanism and blackened jungles like the one adorning the cover gracefully sets the scene with atonal mist and soft flashes like flitting fireflies while y and close the often inscrutable entagled with a satisfying sense of space and harmony if these tracks werent meant to illustrate a foreboding supernatural place they were at least conceived with a singular intent that clear vision elevates what might otherwise be a workmanlike collection this is soundsystem music no doubt but even compared to s recent northern electronics 12-inch these tracks are lean and straightforward nothing here is quite so lovely as cleansed in fire ( is close) or as angular as floating (despite the slant of s loping gait) some might find the tribal edge of and y a bit overdone others could very well take pleasure in the familiar dark druggy milieus held up to the likes of june and mu entagled isnt the most evocative or unmistakable full-length but anyone who spends time soaking in its well-crafted world of rhythm and texture will soon find reason to return
have thus far really failed to click for me (most un-memorably with the lumpen fter dark compilation) but houstons have served up something far more interesting in at the tasteful even stately its a balmy summer tune that evokes far more imagery than genre tags or band references i catch the vaguest impressions of rago farina of british raincoat pop of sombre teutonic vocalists but they drift off into the chunky unexpected early house synth workout of the final half ingredients here are disarmingly simple a hazy floodlit vocal; lambent guitar strums; iambic drum beat; slowly building synth its in their assembly that they shine sequenced like the ebb and flow of a late lazy evening in july present in vocal and instrumental versions (along with a pleasant guitar-and-vocal a cappella) theres little by which we can judge range no matter what weve got here is welcome enough: an intriguing and promising debut from and a nice change of pace from italians
over three discs rush hours alism (1994- ) compiles the work of techno underdog nthony shake shakir work which predominantly appeared (in extremely limited runs) on his own al label lthough he is not typically listed among his citys first and second wave luminaries there is a palpable air of reverence when shakir is mentioned; hes developed a deep cult following and generally one hears a lot about how hes an elusive maverick before experiencing any of his productions alism ought to dispel any remaining mystery while daunting in stature its a chameleonic and consistently engaging collection and frankly astonishing in the breadth of styles it showcases if there is an undercurrent running through these productions its shakirs irregular live approach his resident dvisor interview he talked about adding a hip-hoppish approach to electronic music and the sort of tweaked sample-based accidents-in feel that characterizes many of hip-hops great productions is fully in place here tracks break down and slide into high frequencies without warning: shakirs malleability isnt limited to the myriad of genres encompassed here; it pervades the songs themselves many have written that shakirs tracks prefigured plenty of contemporary electronic music trends from wonky to the modern disco edit this is not untrue stop-start reverbed-out beat wavy synth flourishes and thick boogie-influenced bassline on like a are a glorious precursor to the former and a is glimmering elastic future disco; lovely dancing with a view of metropolitan lights stretching forever nevertheless shakirs is a brand of techno steeped in tradition combination of sweeping emotion and executions at once complex and immediate is the same blend that endears his contemporaries juan tkins and carl craig nd like the catalogs of those producers theres something for everyone here highlights include the e2-e4 -style languid drift of the lightly buzzing synths looping over each other for the duration frenchie is twitchy insectoid motorway funk is a clattery jacker with a heavily filtered vocal sample and is another tense grungy-and-refined number repeating and repeating before breaking into beautiful squiggly synths at exactly the right moment s much as im gushing its difficult to overstate how inimitable a collection this is all the genre-shifting none of its experiments feel contrived if shakir prefigured anything it was more a result of trying out something new than aiming to be some kind of trendsetter spite of this its likely trends will (accidentally or not) continue to bear traces of shakirs touch alism is brazenly futuristic and even difficult at times but never retentive or academic shakirs homemade personalized touch resonates throughout and his talent for preserving this while testing dance musics outer limits is truly a singular one

we are only two releases in to schedule and this 2nd release comes from sjunkes the track is and it is armed with a breaks mix alongside a remix from jose zamora the breaked up mix is first up and on the whole it is quite a smooth moody deep progressive break number starting off smoothly with moody atmospheric elements and delicate percussive beats the track builds and concludes without trying to do too much but instead nicely flowing from start to finish with more subtle deep elements the jose zamora remix tries to lift the pace a bit turning it into a deep progressive production that has quite similar features to the a-side this mix is also quite deep with a heavy focus on the atmosphere of the production as well as a focus on smooth baselines early on again quite a solid production without going over the top

side from its title the third single from jacques renault and marcos cabrals project is surprisingly devoid of the usual sonic ties to the ig pple no skeletal liquid liquid punk-funk no wave freak-outs or sizzling electro-disco no sneering posture or winking attitude just a mesmerizing relentless two-beat tribal tom loop and a chunky uplifting two-chord piano riff thats dubbed out for maximum bliss while new york is nearly without parallel for artistic experimentation especially when it comes to forward-thinking hybrids and genre-fucks its refreshing to actually encounter a new local dance production that eschews posture and play and simply goes for the jugular theres a bit of a handmade quality in that works in its favor a slight muddiness and lack of precise digital veneer that makes for an invigorating subterranean dance vibe the kind that signals what side of the east river the club is on this isnt the manhattan of fascist door policies and bottle-service lux interiors its the of sweat-soaked warehouse free-for-alls then halfway through just when youve settled into the joys of a stripped but dreamy house groove theres a surprise starburst of acidic 909 stabs an inspired ace up the sleeve that propels things towards the conclusions heady almost abstract outer limits while it might seem that such a distinctive and barebones piece would be fertile ground for remix mutations the offerings here dont have an easy time getting out from under the original on the df release rennan greens remix starts out a glistening cowbell-kissed straightshooter but while it aims at cosmic lift-off halfway through it never completely gets off the ground for a space-disco churner its got all the right moves but sometimes its exactly when youre out looking for the right moves instead of the best moves that you lose the thrust of the individual track youre working on and your disco voyage winds up a bit undercooked meanwhile over on the rekids side of the tlantic ls s remix fares better but thats partly because it sets it sights lower content to up the rhythm ante with a clean house kit thats more genial party-starter rather than the originals near-sunrise soul cleanser
on this four track ep goes for the jugular arely a chink of light is allowed to permeate the inky black atmosphere that shrouds the 40 minutes of minimal techno on offer and the result is a single-minded screwed-up ep make no mistake this is skewed and sinister dance music its also the latest in a series of forceful reminders that the overpowering grey sparsity of the best 00s minimal hasnt been abandoned by all starts things off at an edgy frantic pace nagging one note riff is splattered against a monolithic wall of bass for 12 minutes percussion drips through the track like water falling in a cave while the beat is almost idiotic in its insistence zimmermanns sound sculpting is often way above the usual standard and this time the track has the intensity to match its hard to think of a tune in that demands to be used in a big club so vociferously next up is oy a deeper track thats a bit less twisted zimmermann layers vocodered easy lee style vocals over a rolling bassline creating a psychedelic monotony thats a little like early gummihz releases on mobilee 5 0 ramps things back up again with a deep sub bass and little else apart from a few cymbal shards and droning pitched down vocals it sounds like an all too familiar description but zimmermanns heavy duty production makes it work the ideas arent mindblowing but the execution is enough that said for zimmermann flexes his muscles a bit and creates a sleepy psychedelic haze an 11-minute lullaby for those who listen to techno to get them to sleep at night its the least club friendly of the four tracks it sounds like a series of unplanned robotic malfunctions which have somehow come to be used as music with erratic dribbles of melody and weak fading lights bouncing back and forth it may also be the most striking track on this release zimmermann has fashioned four raw techno pieces here without a single concession to the overground while the ideas arent necessarily singular apart from the brute force of the sound design carries him through listen with patience and be prepared to find yourself gulping with shock
it must be confusing being alan abrahams having worked for the past few years as both portable the south african producer is now increasingly blurring the distinctions between the pseudonyms while portable started off with a focus on abstract electronics more recently he has steered it increasingly towards sensuous deep house witness last years spellbindingly evocative no one can release the many on perlon the rumbling tribal grooves of the emerald life on musik krause this years glorious remix of oleg poliakovs rainy dayz on circus company similarly which abrahams ostensibly set up at the behest of ghostly/spectral to focus on dance floor techno has drifted into a grey middle ground where both projects now reside there are echoes of the brooding organs menacing bass that made s 2006 debut album the conservation of electric charge such a dark pleasure but the tone on the follow up is softer more introspective its arguable that s transformation had begun back in 2007 with the rumbling organic house of a document of an american past on yore but the blurring of any remaining boundaries between both projects is completed on is a good example of this convergence: a ponderous bass provides the basis for warm chord sequences dissected stuttering vocals but the trademark organ riffs then appear giving off an undeniable sense of menace follows a similar path its sensuous chords juxtaposed with a foreboding rhythm with sinister undercurrents but the overall mood on the album is one of sadness tales of spurned lovers abject melancholia thats not to suggest that these themes make for uneasy or heavy listening: while features a female vocalist imploring how can you say you can live without me / how can you say you want to leave me its based on a positively perky acid sequence meanwhile the spooky keys on the title track may create a mysterious aura but its one that fascinates rather than repels compelling this listener to hit repeat instead of off also sees abrahams move away from the dance floor again features what sounds like a sitar sparkles over deft breaks murky bass pulses but unfortunately is less effective its chopped up stop start arrangement sounding too busy however these tracks are mere distractions from the deeply soulful dance floor friendly path that follows the rolling groove of is imbued with lush pads oriental riffs but its true strength is its resonating snaking bass lending what sounds like an ethereal take on portables deep house real dance floor muscle ill meanwhile makes its approach from the opposite angle the warm fuzzy bass weeping organ coming across like a reflective outtake from conservation but it reaches the same evocative destination so while its now impossible to separate abrahamss two projects trying to do so misses the point somewhat he has taken the best elements from both painstakingly fused them on irrespective of whether its portable or an amalgam thereof to paraphrase abrahams himself its the power of one that proves to be most compelling
given that cosmin nicolae has worked his deep techno alchemy for some of the great and good of the genre hessle audio hemlock rush hour 50 weapons its surprising that hes taken so long to launch his own label he pushes down the slipway with two trademark dark witching-hour jams the nature of is given away by its title; it settles into a groove early and sticks there a relentless industrial-leaning rumble carved out of energetic brawny kicks eccentric chimes and a quivering loop towards the end the romanian producer ratchets up the tension by introducing eerie lalo schiffrin-style chords its oppressive but gratifyingly so its not a huge leap from to which is built on a crackling percussive loop and hi-hats that sizzle and spit like theyre being tossed around in a saucepan this is finely crafted richly textured techno

while the recently released third 12-inch from records continues the swedish duos exploration of the intersection of techno and house to lesser effect than on previous installments the limited remix 12-inch released last month showcases exactly how malleable their work can be dutch producer ardvarck takes and twists what was already an excellent tune into a certified banger the voice at the back gets mangled early and often beneath heavy breakbeat techno its mind-warping stuff leaning heavily on its stuffed-to-the-brim sound design before unleashing a lovely synth progression to send you over the top if utechre still cared to make dance floor fodder this is what it might sound like detroit producer jared meanwhile brings his analogue fetish to bear on placed all of the momentum of the original on the off beats giving the track a strange swaying unease pushes things resolutely forward filling the spacious original with electro sleaze new york circa 2001 meets erlin that might be the equation on any other 12-inch it might be the standout track especially considering the rush generated by the moment new york and erlin couple in an orgy of basslines and 808 here though you wouldnt be blamed if you never gave it a listen at all
has been quiet this year 2011 saw the producer refracting a range of house and techno idioms through his distinctive lens with his tumbledown beats finding a home on [nakedlunch] idle hands and elsewhere this year the careworn aesthetic mcphee champions may have become more widespread than ever but its taken until now for new productions to emerge from the torontonian: namely an ep of robust beat tracks for wncl and this one-sided ten-inch for ramp sublabel br inm th marking the imprints return after two years of inactivity where the wncl ep is perhaps mcphees most forthright material yet goes in the other direction indulging the woozy nocturnal r b tendencies found in his debut release this sort of vocal collaging ought to feel utterly tired by now a sound forever associated with post-dubsteps more tepid operators but mcphee manages to give it a dark subtle twist essentially this is house music: as evidenced by the claggy kick drum all queasy subterranean rumble and a hi-hat that sounds as if its been rubbed raw but it functions as pop of a sort seducing with its codeine-addled sob-inducing melodics the results are hypnotic if not groundbreaking; a compelling side-note from a producer still in the ascendant
is back after four years this time on the french label that has been released a steady stream of forward thinking dancefloor ideas since 2004 four years have passed since todd s last release but his return is stamped with the same eloquent deep mood and real funk arrives gnarly and jackin with trucker cap samples and seedy stabs that ll suit djs on the french underground while is a little deeper and less crunked up with low pads and a cute girl groove one for the deep house soldiers wearing k-swiss on the flip delivers naughty vocals and a deviant sample while with comes in a little softer with a different outlook vocals colliding around soft tippy-toe keys and exclusive percussive elements todd is a very well accomplished producer who knows how to arrange and is a welcome return natacha labelle s vocal snippets especially give the house/techno/retro/ghetto tech proceedings a moody and raunchy edge and while it might have taken time for todd to come up with this quality it s a comeback that raises the bar
uk duo are one of the most reliable drum bass outfits of recent years pumping out single after single of melodic-but-not-too-pop ultra-polished beats for labels like critical exit and shogun latter is just now gearing up to release their debut album and the first taste of it shows them mining the most accessible glossy territory of their careers y do it well like most of their catalogue is executed with finesse and style aluminum-light drums are grounded by a buzzing bassline that growls but never quite roars leaving plenty of breathing room for cinematic strings that swoop and twirl like paper streamers (of heartbeat fame) is drafted in for an anxious but soulful vocal breathy gasps and nuanced phrasing unperturbed by the snapping drums working nearly as well as a pop song as it does a drum bass tune on the flipside shackled is less concerned with the elegant phrasing of featuring hard-hitting drums that shatter into loose globs of amen breaks at the end of the bars and gruff verses from combustible bassline plays the same dynamic role those strings did on striking an odd sort of grey-skies anthemia that should relieve those worried about a full-on pop assault from the duo
in cribbing the title of his debut album from one of warriors keynote speeches not to mention bookending the intro and outro tracks with further samples from the film 25 year-old new yorker makes his debt to walter hills 1979 opus abundantly clear beyond that though youd be hard-pressed to spot any other obvious connections to the move for while the new york envisioned by hill was one full of wildly colourful gangs the majority of comes garbed in the same uniform of deep synths and bubbling bass and where warriors had to battle across hostile territory here rarely ventures beyond his comfort zone equally difficult to detect are any traces of s hip-hop roots the raw rap sounds of mobb and dj premier that surrounded him growing up in queens and which he has been namechecking ever since his first singles on culprit and ovum apart from the crunching beat of that opens the album or the soulful r b cut-ups of his teenage love of beats and rhymes are now all but overwhelmed by his adult ardour for 4/4 still although might be just a straightforward house album rather than anything more dazzlingly diverse or particularly cinematic its undeniably a very good one as with any album that stretches itself well over the hour mark theres the odd dud and dull stretch the filtered disco track fall is disappointingly mediocre and the final few tracks occasionally get stuck in the doldrums but overall proves himself adept at the languid house sound beloved of his feted contemporaries like soul clap and wolf + lamb is a slow-burning groove peppered with the aching vocal samples that crop up throughout the album and that warm nocturnal mood is maintained even when the beats pick up to great effect on dont dont s basslines are a particular joy especially on the elasticated shes or and he also looks beyond the big apple for the old-school detroit techno flavours of 80h8 while you can well imagine nue coming out on 2020vision circa 1999 unlike the film that inspired it probably wont be a cult classic in 30 years time but nor will it look like a dated period piece either
some electronic music fans associate romania with a hypnotic brand of minimal for certain locals however this association obscures artists who are pushing sounds that are closer to the nations complex cross continental character one of these is future nuggets a label run by ion and camil dumitrescu (no relation) bucharest based label has explored romani manele and forgotten synth lords alike charting an alternate perspective of romanian music its new sub label is and this first 12 inch brings together four productions from the label founders and two affiliates and s is a driving cut from a producer better known for her slower chugging productions on c meme and correspondant tracks second half is punctuated by a series of effective breaks which act like a gasp for air amid the whorl of chattering percussion and gassy textures mix is dense with activity but s knack for subtly contrasting sound selections makes more canny as ion dumitrescu contributes a pastoral cut that due to its psychedelic yet serene melodies isnt quite house or techno sounding more like motorik krautrock (the label calls it technodelia ) juxtapose acoustic and electronic instrumentation in their cantering triplet time track which uses modal scales to create a distinct tonality midway through they drop the triplets and dive into a propulsive rhythm adding straight up dance floor satisfaction to the unlikely concoction s track is the purest of the lot but its cascading melody and simple bassline make for a satisfying slo mo hybrid of electro ebm new wave and industrial is more dance floor oriented than future nuggets but the labels first record shows a rich mongrel sound an intriguing look at the variety lurking behind the scenes in romanian electronic music
on februarys vaporub ep mechanized his melancholy motifs with up-tempo abrasive beats to impressively dynamic results f in f sounds very much like a continuation of that release boasting the same clackety high-tempo beats ghostly vocal samples and gloomy ambience in fact aside from the feisty whirfless f in f is a bit too consistent with its predecessor and lacks the finishing touches that make vaporub so rich nonetheless is a gifted artist who lends a moody charisma to all his productions and these three tracks are no exception on the -side is an odd-duck party rocker its unpolished metallic textures set the norm for the ep but jumpy analogue keys and a whirring factory whistle make this one a funky misfit for such a starkly produced techno track it screams party time with surprising lightheartedness nd its perfectly easy to slip into a techno set as some stern arpeggios ride through the final minute paving the way for the stone-faced tracks favored by many of his contemporaries is much less daring the same perky beat skips along surrounded by abrupt crashes and a plodding bassline its got some vivid samples and an overall intriguing vibe but somehow feels hollow and unfinished lacking the clever details that make blackbody or clapface (off of vaporub ep) so evocative flinkclunk is even more stripped down it lacks a catchy bassline and generally feels more like a dj tool than anything else nonetheless its an elegant composition of sharply hissing valves fragmented crashes and a dreary reverb laden atmosphere its probably the best track on the ep and definitely a great one to mix with but still not as memorable as much of smokes recent work s a bundle of atypically colorful techno tracks this ep doesnt disappoint and will receive its share of dj attention but considering its precursor on hum + haw its not hard to suspect that now saves the best cuts for his own label
s work is almost entirely defined by his processing of raw musical material on his most famous work disintegration loops magnetic tape began to come apart on the reels of a tape machine causing its sound to distort and little by little disappear altogether a loop of brass music plays over and over echoing disintegrating effect is utter melancholy is the product of a similar process basinski loops a snippet of piano he recorded in the 80s feeding the audio through a series of delays delicate shifting balance of the original sound and its echoes constitutes the whole 20-minute work underlying piano recording is classic basinski muddied and softened by low-quality tape it never asserts a particular direction it turns back on itself again and again its edges blurred gentle and woozy like someone drunk on cheap wine ( denouement) repeats the trick first with a similar piano snippet and then a grand orchestral sample a low drone underpins it all taking the full six minutes to overpower the orchestra before dying slowly power of music such as this is entirely dependent on the context in which its heard like all of basinskis work it lets the listeners mind wander freely while quietly nudging their mood seems like a late-night record one that breezes in and out of perception while you ruminate on other thoughts this isnt basinskis first time using this particular piano recording is a companion piece to a forty-minute version of the same thing which gets a 10-minute reprise here as the final track same recordings also appeared in 92982 a record from 2009 in one sense this merely highlights the importance of process to basinskis work; the freshness of the source material is always secondary to the treatment it receives this simple piano could be endlessly reconfigured becoming something new every time it passes through a set of wires and tape heads res a point however when a signature process becomes an artist repeating their most successful experiment is graceful sad and in the right context beautiful it doesnt add much to basinskis catalogue but then again variation doesnt seem to be the point
funkineven releases plenty of quality 12 inches on his own label pron but it feels like he saves his best for over the last few years hes released a steady stream of brilliant singles for the label the last of which was the slick pop song phone line with fatima his latest track for floating points and lexander nuts label is still heavily funky and geared towards the dance floor but its introspective and a little fantastical too s clipped snares stand out against a pulsing swirl of arpeggios synthesised strings and slippery acid on the side bstract s is a spaced out psychedelic jam all off kilter drum machine hits and swollen bassline text accompanying the release describes it as a sakamoto esque journey over the pyramids and although this is a little far reaching there is a sense of sweeping grandeur to the way the phrases on these tracks dramatically build and fade
seems determined to keep people guessing last years ciao toggled between rave bangers indie dance and eclectic electro pop; now he recruits fellow canadian mathew dial stalwart efdemin and strangest of all dutch dubstepper martyn to rework the most out-of-character cut on the album s song was a schaffel lullaby built of organs and billowing overdubbed vocals and the three remixers approach to the material couldnt be more different matthew translates the originals cadence to swinging 6/8 time and save for the vocals it sounds less like a remix than a remake with s parts loosely rescored for s collection of analog and modular synthesizers (a dub version which does away with the vocals sounds like 100 ) as with s recent agents of time the track makes the most out of a handful of elements tweaking filters and throwing gentle kinks into repeated sequences but its hardly his most exciting work efdemin doesnt exactly distinguish himself here either especially not after his recent remixes for vsq and pantha du prince not to mention his album chicago he lays out a dirty tech-house groove around a monotone bass throb and loosely overlapping hi-hats using a single slow-moving chord as tone color a single vocal phrase ( one step and a little touch/ can change the way you feel tonight ) soaks up the breakdown anticlimactically and then were back in the game with an additional set of blippy chords to mark the shift a nice dry rimshot adds a bit of bite but its not a track that stands out or sticks with you the most interesting remix is martyns which is also the most outr thanks to the way hes re-sampled s vocals into a wordless chorus that apes thom yorkes slippery agonized delivery the groove heavily swung and punctuated by stabbing syncopated keys is far slower than were used to from martyn; the tempo falls in the mid 120s and its not overly interested in forward motion from the mixdown to the swollen arrangement to the chiming chords it sounds like a downcast answer to strings of life heavy-hearted but not quite ready to give up
juju jordash are technos most popular jam band jordan czamanski and gal aner take to a genre known for its rigid form with gleeful formlessness incorporating elements of jazz dub and rock no two records sound the same but theyve all been psychedelic and meandering clean-cut their last lp signalled a change czamanski and aner reined in their improvisational approach for a more straightforward dance floor style on -boom-bah the duo make a lateral move away from the dance floor but show the same discipline in the process theyve made their most idiosyncratic and enjoyable album reconciling their two sides in a way that none of their previous records have -boom-bah was made with a stripped-back approach duo laid down drum tracks over which theyd groove with guitar and fender rhodes mood is pitched mostly between a balearic beach and an arid desert full of humid wah-wah licks groovy basslines and exotic synth leads the instrumental interplay is top notch and the duos use of effects is subtle but potent rhythm section on is so dubbed-out and springy that it makes the track feel like its floating on the breeze gently changing direction here and there is a good example of how aner and czamanski have tightened their composition its ebb and flow is occasionally disrupted by a pretty synth motif before locking back into the beat as if the two were startled back into attention after daydreaming most of the tracks on -boom-bah groove on a single idea which leads to some unusually droney tracks ( ) as well as some lovely techno like which sounds like a detroit track submerged and rippling through water -boom-bah s every touch feels considered whether its the funky bassline on or the trickling melodies of which is so delicate that you imagine any loud noise might send it falling over juju jordash have found a home in restraint and rigour given the nature of their live performances and albums like primitivism this change would have once seemed unlikely rather than letting compositions fan out in all directions the duo focus on a sweet spot and wring everything they can out of it that makes -boom-bah their smoothest and most consistent album czamanski mixed the album by himself for the first time which might help explain the change his solo work as jordan gcz is meditative like krautrock qualities that now apply to the duos music whatever the cause theyre a band with a new purpose where once they seemed content to let their instruments take them wherever they ended up juju jordash now know exactly where they want to go and how to get there
i feel that when producers take on a remix of a classic they are taking on much more than just a normal remix what if they dont do the original justice the pressure if definately on new york native hisham samawi has definately done the original justice and even added something new to famous track compass error the track starts with an inticing percussive groove and throbbing bassline broken beats are the order of the day here people and as the beats fly left and right filtered hits glide into the song spacey pads float and twist around the bassline until the timeless vocal is introduced a soft melody is teased around the room until the track breaks down the breakdown allows the vocal to be used to its fullest and once its started its loop the bass percussion and every other element in the track build and build until the track explodes with a flurry of beautiful pads and hits this is breaks at its best a great remix of a great original if you missed the original compass error hishams mix definately makes up for it dont miss it twice
the eerily prescient project producer eddie ruschas self-described nexus of psychedelic and tropical has been going its own way since at least 1995 when ruschas first musical missives made their way to tascam 4-track gaining traction through self-released collections on his bandcamp a series of cassette compilations on teenage teardrops and a big 12-inch for beats in space records earlier this year ruschas vision seems now to be revealing itself in full appropriately picked up by prins s spesial imprint certainly feels like a coming-out party: with a driving disco beat anchored by groovy piano chords vocoder nonsense and all-hardware freakouts it makes for eleven-and-a-half of the more spaced-out minutes youre likely to experience all day but as rollicking as he is at his biggest ruscha shines most when he strips the beat bare letting a thick bassline lap at his cavernous drum groove tiago the portuguese producer first up on remix duties really gets this: his extra guitar vamps really seize on the spaces between the beats himself drops in with a beat more a streamlined edit of the original than a major departure
the first release from dj quests new breaks imprint shows off the happier and party-rocking side of dj quest and friends funkatech is the offshoot label of dj quests cyberfunk records known mainly for pulling out the darker harder edged breaks/garage rollers side a - -play starting off with a piano tune the beats kick in shortly afterwards to create an uplifting 2-step garage frenzy heavy bass accompanies the beats and melody and this is a serious party starter/anthem great way to kick off their label with a tune like this side b dj quest - the brief if you have heard a dj quest track (his haunted gospel with king koop appears on the very accessible and price friendly urban funk breaks iii) you will be familiar with his typical breaks/garage productions - that rolling breakbeat style if not think drumnbass slowed down or early 90s breakbeat style starting off very mellow the nasty ass breaks kick in and it gets harder and darker from there quest doing for garage what doc scott did from drumnbass - hard dark rolling beats and breaks being only their first release funkatech have done really well and hopefully we can see more party style garage like this coming from them
borne from the ashes of wurst edits roy danks two year old wurst music co has thus far had a simple mission: 12 inches all of them house and disco inclined thats not exactly a rarity these days of course what sets the imprint apart is its faithful adherence to the aesthetics of these original genres is the new york labels first compilation and the greatest expression of this devotion to date track one is midnight s a snare heavy arrangement props up wavering vocals and gorgeous flurries of horns and trumpet hiding in the depths of this rapturous mid range a plucky bass guitar keeps things moving forward next up the new jersey duo take things a bit dirtier offering up a funk laden piece with jocular vocals t oozes cool using roughed up bass and a compact guitar line to strut along from here things get sleeker and a touch more modern fat drums characterise both soho808s and portuguese artist s remix of his own track former pairs these with spacey pads and r b tinged vocals while the latter has the same kind of relentless bass groove found on donna summers classic feel swedish trio also turn in an impressive piece with a jaunty slice of tropical persuasions a subtle 303 underpins the cut though its a joyous steel drum that takes the lead from this pespective however the best moments come towards the end as in the past s use of talo style arpeggiation is superb though this time hes teamed with long time friend for the aforementioned arp barely stops twanging away often matched by a rapidly hissing hi hat around these two frantic elements everything else seems to move at half pace eventually the whole thing scurries toward a towering crescendo setting it apart from most music at this tempo conversely is the most sluggish track weighing in with background hand drums a deep squelching low end and all manner of bright synth work s downcast cant t rests on style percussion but makes up the rest with breathy vocals disco pads and plinking piano again making good use of ivory s thats the is this time all about joy a patchwork of exultant and well stitched vocals carry us most of the way through with a distinct hip hop vibe last engish artist shows off the super smooth sultry flute lines breeze through the track alongside big crunchy percs res also some well placed blasts of rave whistle and later dubbed out wavering chords like many of the pieces here it might really be two decades old were it not for the slick sound design thats what makes it and the whole compilation so great even at their most contemporary all the tracks seem to respect where theyve come from old sounding doesnt automatically equate to good but sure makes a convincing argument
a few weeks ago i woke up with the melody from track one of s in my head thats a remarkable feat considering id only heard the song once before its a statement which fairly summarises the german producers output though hes been around for ages this is his seventh album but its his continued shift into catchiness which has seen him bestowed with rock star status that and a movie which appears to have been seen by every teen and 20-something in germany (and parts of europe) makes no attempt to rock the boat like berlin calling it opens with a slow-winding guitar track and follows up with more overtly club-oriented material in fact the albums greatest weakness is sheer similarity to its predecessor percussion programming and samples seem to have been re-used on several occasions the most obvious example is string embellished which employs the same hissing piston-like hi-hat of 2008s train past that criticism though theres not a great deal to dislike at least for recently-joined fans though overall he might play it a little safe theres adequate variation in mood and intensity to hold interest but not enough to reduce the whole listening experience to that of fragmented compilation for example is driving and single-minded is filled with enough jazzy flourishes to impart light-heartedness despite its stomping kick drum and the shunting claps and slow chords of provide a pleasing break halfway as usual theres concern for song structure and a measured patient approach which sees elements eased to their conclusion rather than forced where his compatriots techno visions can encompass industrialism futurism or sheer soulfulness kalkbrenners is unique its about berlins rattling trains carrying thousands of merry partiers to and from clubs across the city and bleary moments of emergence into sunlight perhaps people inherently pick up on this spirit which is why kalbrenners music including this album will continue to be loved by the entire spectrum of electronic music listeners and some outside of it
jazz is rarely seen as a young persons game but has contradicted that perception in the last few years the uk producer real name cameron palmer combines jazz and funk instrumentation with the thrust of dubstep even touring with a full band more impressive is how natural the fusion feels ot just dubstep with some horns tacked on palmers arrangements have grown tighter and more ambitious through the years he nearly perfected his dubstep-jazz formula with last years walters call ep on brownswood but as if sensing a peak palmer changed focus for his latest album peace love music looks outward rather than inward finding new energy in the places hes toured returning to his old home base of whose flamboyant grime first helped make room in bass music for his eccentricities palmer works with artists from many of those cities to carefully flesh out the album even if peace love music was inspired by new places new people and new experiences it still sounds like the same we know the music sits firmly in the uk dance continuum touching on dubstep grime and drum bass with an expert hand and though the perspective may jump from to los angeles to south africa peace love music isnt a travelogue nor does it employ tacky world music clich s the feeling of each location is absorbed in a more indirect way from the funky glam of through the speedy lunge of kyo one of the most direct and club-ready moments here only with its asian instrumentation or with its d-e- -v-e-r chant come close to cultural tourism (the latter is a goofy but heartfelt tribute to one of dubsteps capital cities anyway ) the worldly feeling also comes through the enormous variety from nasty tear-out dubstep on s (the -repping track) to the murky menace of featuring and mungos (illustrating the cross-section of influences that define glasgow clubland) has filipino vocalist scatting over a loose and itchy woodblock rhythm that couldve been sourced from an old darkstar record and then brings things back home with a soulful performance from adorned with lush brass woodwinds and a string section its the kind of formula that could turn to muzak mush in the wrong hands but in palmers its potent a collaboration with pokes fun at that strand of loungey electronica setting a blue horn melody in snappy drum framework that sounds suspiciously like baauer rl grimes infinite daps the funny combination only gets weirder once it turns to drum bass halfway through an example of palmers lighthearted approach as well as his knack for pulling the unexpected out of the familiar something thats helped keep his brand of dubstep consistently fresh those last two ideas make peace love music palmers best record yet the connection to is key especially considering that palmers recent releases have come via dubstep traditionalists deep medi when was founded it helped revolutionize and revitalize grime as a healthy dance music scene not only by emphasizing the producer over the mc but by folding in elements of uk garage dubstep and bassline to loosen the otherwise hermetically-sealed genre rules which is what palmer does for himself on peace love music an album as cosmopolitan as its ambitious tracklist makes it out to be
ts hard to trust a record label when the vast majority of their output is from one person ut look back into the annals of discogs and youll discover the henry maldonado (aka ) isnt some dance music self-publicist his cv includes work on strictly rhythm maw and king street sounds alearic and old-school disco is maldonados game these days under his alias and the trial y fire ep is yet another foray to the edges of good taste percussion-heavy takes a while to fully reveal itself maldonado finally drops a bassline more than three minutes into the proceedings but once it does the unison melody/bass enhance the tracks muscularity on the other hand wastes no time with its disembodied ha sample and epic synth line tipping its hat to the alearic slands ts the clear highlight here movement makes up the entirety of the -side and disappoints in comparison undecided between disco drums a choppy guitar and mellow synths it isnt until the track enters its second half that things begin to cohere extended percussion and synth break give time to hear how everything each part interlocks without the intrusive guitar entering into the picture for a while at least stick with the a-side on this one though and you cant go wrong
following acclaim for their frisky spreo superbus single on numbers last year london duo take their brand of hi-octane jukey house to dj haus new label project im not sure what mark jonathan rutherford and jamie kingett put in their tea but a scintillating energy radiates from their music on that comes from what sounds like a maniacal take on both the jungle rothers ill house you and rob ase and dj ez-rocks it takes two then stir in screaming female vocals a searing shepard tone and crashing percussion it twitches and jerks like its suffering from a bout of st vitus dance while it scoots along at footwork pace for much of its duration is less frantic although it still pulses with youthful brio a vocal sample is slowed to a slur before being ramped up to breakneck speed while daft punk-style arps rise to the surface midway through all tied together by an uplifting quick-quick-slow rhythm theres more than a hint of machinedrum about it which is no bad thing eliphinos remix turns the track into whip-cracking house without losing the originals pizazz founded on a dirty low-end bass throb hi-nrg handclaps and sirens it cleverly maintains the eps feverish intensity
on the opener from the fourth studio album by james murphy picks up where he left off six years ago track blends elements of rock and electronic music and elements of the past and the present ts a six-minute song with a skeletal beginning confessional lyrics and a soaring crescendo nine tracks that follow roughly speaking explore the formulas found on past records n some respects on nothing has changed but this of course is only part of the story n 2011 finished for good y played an extravagant farewell show at new yorks madison square garden made a documentary and released a final live album a lot of the songs ve written are as good as m going to do murphy told clash dont want to repeat myself so what becomes the next goal being bigger eventually though something changed n a long facebook post early last year murphy explained why after spending the last half-decade following his creative impulses towards coffee shops and subway turnstiles he was getting the band back together hed written songs that he liked he felt it made no sense to start a new project to release them and the groups other members pat mahoney nancy whang and al yle were willing to give a reunion a shot all understandable perhaps but this didnt prevent a fierce backlash from some fans who felt betrayed by the groups highly publicised death and resurrection m seriously sorry murphy said in the post only thing we can do now is get back into the studio and finish this record and make it as fucking good as we can possibly make it t needs to be better than anything weve done before every album has featured variations on similar lyrical and musical themes but on there are two tweaks that make a significant impact this isnt an overtly political record as the title implies but theres a newfound sincerity here that reflects both the current despair of liberal america and the presumably torturous decision behind reuniting the band this is perhaps most obvious in whats not on the album where sound of silver and this s happening each had songs that would sound good at college parties ( daft punk s playing at my house north scum and drunk girls respectively) theres no equivalent here n the scheme of the lean albums murphy likes to write this makes a big difference also feels lighter on irony rightly or wrongly murphy became a figurehead for generation y hipsterism and his previous albums had a sense of cool detachment that became a signature just before the lcd reunion murphy worked on star the final david bowie album its difficult to imagine him coming away from that experience and wanting to write a track like drunk girls se omissions make the most cohesive lcd record so far t moves through some of the bands archetypes the peppy dance-punk number the synth-led banger the warped ballad with ten intuitive steps opening run of tracks is particularly strong on murphys laments ( m on my knees ) have never sounded so earnest his synths never so rich offsets its mid-tempo bump with paranoia as nancy whang sings who can you trust and who are your friends third track revisits themes of passing time and irrelevancy both murphy favourites but the delivery is almost the antithesis of a track like losing my edge res a lack of obvious anthems on which depending on your expectations might either be a let-down or a welcome change of pace none of the singles so far nite and have the festival singalong credentials of someone great or all my friends but each plays its part in the albums makeup nite isnt the finest dance floor cut the band has ever written but its tone and timing after the records most dramatic moment is crucial sleep a nine-minute track that would make u2 sound slight is a masterclass in arrangement standing on the shore facing east murphy wails strings and atmospherics gradually swell around him before a monstrous kick and synth combo is unleashed closes on a similarly epic if more downbeat note been saving email trails kept together murphy sings on his voice distressed by effects read them back sometimes to remember albums final five minutes are purely instrumental just a simple piano figure and a bass pulse but they could be the saddest moments in the groups catalogue were all going to die someday so you change your mind murphy wrote to a commenter in the facebook post get remarried to your ex if you fall back in love speak to your parents after vowing to never do so again but on murphy stuck to his word have made a better album than theyve ever done
s latest record its first for marks the debut of a dj and analog-loving producer from bari italy presents three acid tracks that are more house-y than the labels usual tough detailed techno and its grittier moments are its best is a low-slung cut anchored by a particularly bruising kick drum suffused with shadowy pads and punctuated by sharp buzzing acid employs similar though more subdued pad work but its faster-paced drums feel a bit awkwardly arranged at first and otherwise it sounds too clean and by-the-numbers to really stand out the last track finds a happy middle ground for nearly eight minutes its resonating licks of acid tease and stretch over a gaunt drum groove overall the record reveals some raw potential but is nothing spectacular
will be seen as the year where footwork went overground at least when it comes to european exposure e of the men who has been instrumental in bringing this about has been boss mike paradinas throwing his weight behind the sound with releases from dj nate dj roc and the man who is arguably the most popular contemporary producer on the chicago scene with the exception of the lead cuts stuttering soul-infused clap frenzy which was released digitally on the juke trax imprint late last year is comprised of entirely fresh material giving listeners a good idea of where his production head has been of late if the brash lo-fi rumblings of z are anything to go by we can expect his material to go in a darker more bass-heavy direction although the loopy hip-hop and r b vocals of on hint that hes not fully left that particular direction behind the latter is a particular highlight its use of stabbed brass and strings opening out into a jazzy sax riff and relentless hi-hats modulation is a tool that is rarely employed in modern footwork so its pleasing to hear use it to bring a dramatic edge to the frenetic electro-tinged arpeggios of s the s jerky rhythmic chops create a similar edge with a much different technique and should prove to be a favourite with djs looking to cause a spasmodic effect on the floor many of the nce mania releases featured a short shouts track as the last cut on the b-side which usually comprised of stripped down beats and spoken dedications to either the artist behind the release or their contemporaries and continues in this tradition although itll most probably feature heavily in his own sets as a kind of signature its rudimentary production doesnt make up for the fact that the simple vocal is looped almost to the point of annoyance still there are five tracks here that are worthy of a place in any modern footwork djs set and should keep fans happy before mus bangs works vol 1 compilation drops early next year
if you only know dori sadovnik and niv arzis music from their singles youd be forgiven for thinking of as a house act tel aviv duo make an eccentric version of that sound prone to wiggly arrangements and kaleidoscopic colorings but even on tracks where they hew closest to their guitar music roots their edit of siams tel aviv downtown for instance or their cover of bauhauss bela lugosis dead sadovnik and arzi had an eye on the dance floor ir latest album emphasises the anything-goes free-form abandon of the late 70s and early 80s post-punk scenes from which sound derives may not be club music but it is party music is a ramshackle blend of snaky fuzzbox bass blues guitar and what sounds like a vintage farfisa organ is meth-crazed psychobilly its revved-up rat-a-tat drums propelling the bassline its close cousin could pass for an extravagant cut by cramps lysergic jangle of recalls echo bunnymen albums loose-limbed playfulness extends to its dance floor tracks simple hand percussion taps out the tempo on the abr o-assisted before a series of drum rolls cue the tracks buildups and breakdowns triumphant chime of is anchored by a steady kicks whose attempt to impose discipline is undermined by chaotic woodblocks albums purest club track overlays a chugging beat with a moroder-style arpeggiated bassline but even here the ebb and flow of squiggles and effects keep things from feeling too structured its a fun song on an album full of fun songs though much of leans heavily on a range of familiar 80s sounds sadovnik and arzi add enough of their own twists to make the music their own
on records little things can take on big resonance the smoothest touch of sierra sam marcus vectors isnt s vocal rather sing-songy and a bit nasal which in context gives it extra appeal but a conga-like (albeit mechanical-sounding) percussion overdub it plays a simple pattern: in full flight [pause] 1-2 [pause] 1-2-3 and occasionally a teaser will just play 1-2 after the second pause to build anticipation but that fill buoys everything lending the clean pile-driving house groove some syncopated looseness in a way that goes right to the upper body: i pity the shoulders that can stay still during this one quenums filter-heavy version has a dark synthed-up sweep that seems made for big rooms cesare vs s goes in for a similar metallic tonal palette but the darker elements mostly occur in the middle as synth chords are pitch-bent further and turn sinister at the corners before the track puts itself back on a straighter galloping path the polar leans on an organ that an old strictly rhythm classic would be proud to call its own s vocal is deployed front and center here against which the sharp drums work up a lovely tension

japans unpredictable has most recently turned its attention to mutant grime and after rabits spacey experiments on sun showers co-founder steps in with a mini-album of an ep that is one of the labels most striking statements yet unpredictable as ever brian durrs sound has always been a tangle of tangents but grime comes to the fore on where across an engrossing 34 minutes its mashed with odd sonics and dancehall influences bakkwaa and with their halting thrusts are most indebted to classic grime but durr prefers to swing his drums in wide arcs rather than the harsh angles were used to he often constructs his songs counterintuitively every element on the psychedelic blud for example feels like its fighting against the current as if durr is engineering everything the wrong way around both casava and blessed are druggy and hypnotic with hard drums that try to punch through the haze of digital grain meanwhile uses the neo-grime tropes of breaking glass and splattering snares and builds them into an antsy drum framework thats more south africa than south london the centerpieces of the ep are a shade more experimental the title track a mostly ambient take on sinogrime sees durr fumbling to find a captivating way to structure it all the ground opens dizzy with actress-style filters layers exploding drums and dazed dancehall vocals to hallucinatory effect its an unexpected detour in the middle of the ep wonderfully emblematic of s increasingly progressive outlook
fter a series of compilations showcasing various producers from l s beat-music scene a mixture of established names like dam-funk shlohmo and daedelus along with label signees like wake and lawrence grey doubles down on its own roster with a split ep from the latter two wake is s matthew michael hern hettich an artist with a particularly lysergic take on beat music his jumbled productions sound like a sample-based game of rock/paper/scissors that uses echo as a kind of nuclear option swallowing up everything in cavernous reverb sten closely though and you can tell that hes got both ideas and range adopts dubsteps tempo but it also echoes the jazzy clatter of early mon tobin with muted horns bleating against disintegrating drum breaks and swollen bass on the fog turns a sweet pastel shade with choral pads rising gracefully from lithe liquid drumming; the effect is a little like lukid remixing grouper sounds like the work of someone who has carefully studied urban tribes the collapse of modern culture while renders big beat as a bad trip swarming with voices and suffocating distortion greys strophilia applies similarly dusky tendencies to techno with muffled drum machines kicking away beneath ragged sawtooth melodies distorted and heavy on the white noise recalls the bluntness of early profan records as well as the clipped sample play of smith hack; sounds like a more lo-fi take on motors brand of darkly dramatic techno but theres a clear outsider sensibility here particularly in the tortuous rhythms and unexpected tempo changes of and which recall old rephlex outliers like vibert simmonds 1994 album weirs

when i spoke to co-founder finn johannsen a couple of months ago about the release of s debut full-length he enthused that the album proves that its still mandatory to listen to all the demos you get finn and stefan goldmanns imprint have always had an ear for the odder end of dance music and are certainly one of the most unconventional 4/4 outfits of current times originating from viennas experimental rock scene guitarist bernhard hammer bassist jakob schneidewind and drummer bernhard breuer are the three members that make up the group but an undeniably huge influence on the record is that of house and techno stalwart patrick pulsinger much has been touted about the lack of overdubs laptops and loops in s recordings but pulsingers attention to detail in the mixing and post-production is just as important pulsinger has managed to coax a real sense of space out of the recordings making it an immersive and all-encompassing headphone listen but theres also plenty on to excite djs who like it dark and tribal as well the powerful driving minimalism of comes across like a rock band attempting a cover of robert hood or jeff mills and s manic bongos and apocalyptic low-frequency rumblings should mix well with similarly paced techno the likes of and lead single should please fans of shackleton villalobos and other trippy minimalists but that undeniable guitar-driven edge remains throughout the record s combination of techno structures with the improvisational techniques of post-rock and krautrock is a refreshing change from the quantised and digitised; breuers free-flowing organic percussion lends a regimented but loose backbone to the two guitarists murky sound design and rhythmic interplay even the more laidback cuts like sun and retain a sense of veiled menace the former using undulating tones to create a sense of unease while the latter cruises along on schneidewinds paranoid dubwise bass riffs but is far from a difficult ride its afrobeat-inspired guitar work and flickering polyrhythmic grooves steadily luring the listener with their narcotic charm those looking for an album full of summer jams are going to want to steer clear of this one make no mistake though: s hauntingly beautiful contents will remain a favourite with its hardened converts during many a dark night for years to come
what separates s work from many o r producers working in same field is that something feels like its on line res no concept no explanation that needs be given about materials used in its construction brock van wey seeks create a direct line with listener s emotional and nakedly so what else would you expect from a guy who titles songs i knew happiness once and wish i was depressing stuff but van weys work has always had a light-at- -end- - -tunnel quality y minor piano chord has a tinkling harp coming along (relatively) soon after brighten things up on his newest album this now includes human voice more than ever before even fur r underlining van weys humanistic bent y never quite get say anything intelligible but that should come as no surprise really in ras interview with van wey last year he uched on pic imagined u pias have m say anything in particular would break spell and take away from what you think y might be singing instead y act like standbys lulling pianos cumulus synths gently plucked guitars just ano r source material pile in inexorable droning waves sound those waves are reminiscent some pop s original contribu rs markus guentner ulf lohmann dettinger which take technos belief in power repetition and maps it on ambients cooler sound palette can still hear traces van weys beat-centric work in pulsing momentum that is underlying much seems beside point describe in depth any tracks here (again spell ) but its worth noting that van wey clearly cuts album in half and title track provide a sort closure yre both around 20 minutes long and rank among producers finest work date similar mammoth cd single live relentlessly pushes its gleaming elements forward adding ano r unbearably emotional element every few minutes or so comes in parts climaxing in a beautiful mess human voices s all essential material from one few artists working in this milieu that sounds relevant in
s brand of house largely borrows its attitude from ghetto tech and hip hop ut a new collaboration between ministre x and mattias mimoun comes from a different perspective in fact the only leftover from the aesthetic that paris club music vol 1 so wonderfully outlined is the fat bottomed bass which turns these tracks into chest beating triumphs with its skittering percussion and infectious vocal sample usy is the least surprising of the singles two sides its thick with synths that collect into sludgy puddles for the drums to splash around in they soften the authoritative piano stabs and throaty acid line leaving an unusual amount of room for textural interplay in such a straightforward club tune on the other hand is a deceptive title theres a pleasing polish to the well rounded sounds but the drums are anything but polite the track fades into a lengthy breakdown that verges on complete silence before returning with a vengeance the way the duo s bulldozer beat comes crashing back in out of nowhere is enough to make you forgive the overused tactic
anyone releasing his first solo album nearly two decades into his career is going to feel a certain burden of expectation even more so if as is case with new york-born berlin-based artist dave sumner aka youre arguably renowned less as a solo producer than as a member of sandwell district and thus had a hand in enigmatic collectives 2011 album feed-forward one of best techno lps of recent years sandwell districts iconic stature has only grown since y put ir label on indefinite hiatus with an oblique communique at end of 2011 which with its talk of experiments and vinyl artifacts could have been penned by jeff mills himself whom sumner credits as a major influence after seeing him dj at limelight in new york back in early 90s sumner has mainly produced singles until now but flows nicely as an album though it isnt explicitly styled as a soundtrack it does have a futurist and foreboding sci-fi feeling throughout the feels like something nasty scraping at a bulkhead while ambient creates sense of being sucked out of an airlock probably clearest echo of mills is in albums minutely-detailed beats and unsettling tones which also form a clear continuum from feed-forward feels full of space both texturally and technically due in no small part to fact sumner entrusted mixdown to veteran engineer tobias freund the void that seems to open up beneath you on gives album a vertiginous sense of scale right from start even pounding beat of begins to feel weightless towards end as it fades beneath vaporous melodies that slowly creep over it a new version of previously released sounds even more expansive than original like something from one of warps old artificial ntelligence compilations yet its rhythms ra r than bleak sonics that give this album its feeling of suspended animation nstead of driving forward on tracks like y circle in hypnotic loops taken as a whole is an album that lures you into dark places in your brain ra r than moving your body on dance floor
s vocal hit come with me gets a reworking by llorca and the very impressive brett johnson in this release by f communcations 2 mixes combined into 1 by llorca and then 2 unique mixes from brett are on the flip the chunky beat and smooth vocals is what llorca s cuminda club dubindaclub offers in the early stages twisted electro synths and patterns soon make their entrance to good effect giving this remix an 80 s style vibe the 2nd half of the track which is in effect the dub combined into 1 giant track takes the vocal and minimises its impact and as a result focuses on the electro sounds and effects a pretty nice reworking from llorca for those that like the retro electro sounds the quirky beats and dirty sinister techy baselines is what the brett johnson mtv europe mix is all about the vocal works brilliantly with the baselines and smooth and funky beats and what is special in this production is the way brett tweaks the baseline to work with the tones of the vocals dirty funky goodness by johnson a little quirkier and bouncy is what brett johnson s blotter special mix is compared to the earlier mtv mix the vocal still works well but this mix is nicely tuned towards the sounds and effects of brett s repertoire one for the quirky tech house heads that like their track off centre a nice remix package using two good producers that work the original vocals and sounds of the original to great effect 2 thumbs up for llorca and brett johnson
and so the deep house beat goes on this time with yet another agn s guise his 672nd at last count turning in the goods for the z rich-based f you want to lay the blame for the genres resurgence at anyones feet agn s is one of the likeliest suspects as label head of sthlmaudio recordings and a sometime slowhouser the man has been relentlessly decreasing the tempo and adding tasteful vocal samples to house music for the past number of years as with any genre theres some good and theres some bad both can be found on ride em begins things typically with the one-handed organ line and a ooo ooooooo sample thats soon joined by shorter cut-up voices that accent the proceedings ts ca 101 and a snoozefest for its six-and-a-half minutes luckily its followed up by the smoother and less busy which is as equally as shameless in its formalism but somehow comes out smelling as fresh as a daisy ts hard to explain why one works and the other doesnt but it may have something to do with s minimalism: with so few elements at play agn s simply rides them into the sunset of the a-side of the vinyl instead of forcing them into a track that doesnt need anything else same goes for the flips which increases the tempo but doesnt bother with cluttering things up ts self-assured and light a mid-morning track for the rising sun meanwhile aptly titled closer sounds like a drugged version of azunis miss brown but dont hold that against agn s azuni a shadowy duo that just released their debut on sthlmaudio is probably just another pseudonym for the producer anyway tracks on that album and ride em sure dont sound like there was much effort put into them n again when deep house is good thats exactly the point
shara nelson doesn t have a voice that lends itself to happy songs it s difficult to imagine her belting out my humps or suchlike she can do life-affirming melancholy however which is roughly where this song sits the theme is of a bittersweet relationship and of course shara s getting the shitty end of the stick: you ll never see inside of me never want to know what s wrong never want to go that deep but on the charles remix married to superpitcher-like soft tones and gently swelling bass it s very hard not to get caught up in the emotion of it all you know it s a bit hokey and her voice inevitably conjures memories of massive ttack playing in starbucks but despite all that this song really works i can definitely see michael mayer or ewan pearson playing this while hordes of happy people blink back the occasional tear nd despite the vocal being the most obvious facet of the song it s not the best thing about it charles s production is incredibly good the song swells and bursts tickles and teases and thumps satisfyingly where required i don t think there s anything wrong with simplicity in music indeed that s what techno and house are basically about but this here is a proper song with the complexity and nuance that goes with that s not that well known but hopefully we re going to see more of the same from him after this on the flipside the redanka mix is a whole other story and is the reason this release can t get more than 3 5 out of 5 here we are demonstrated clearly just how close this song sails to being the worst kind of euro-cheese every corny trick is pulled to try and wring emotion out of the production but you ve heard them all before (probably in neon-lit pubs with crisps on the floor and fruit machines in the corner) do yourself a favour and don t listen to it as it will tarnish the mix by association
despite inherent differences the trajectory of deerhunter frontman bradford coxs project is actually quite similar to his band deerhunter moved from obscured psych-rock to swirling psychedelia to taut indie rock on halcyon digest and s third album presents the same unadorned crystal clarity for better or worse where coxs previous albums sounded like literal bedroom electronica all boxed-in rhythms and heavy-lidded melodies is the product of a studio in fact sounds like a classic rock record but a revisionist one: think smashing pumpkins 1991 debut gish for a similar mixture of traditionalism and modernized psychedelia palette here is mostly guitars soft drums and the occasional synth or sound effect this straightforwardness is established from the outset: opener nails his muttered vocals onto a big jangly guitar figure that sounds like byrds making post-punk has a number of unashamedly accessible moments like the gorgeous piano/acoustic guitar shuffle of or the satisfying electric/acoustic strum of the hymn-like blues my re are unusual touches littered all over the harmonica on or the buoyant bossa nova swing of but there are also typically immersive bouts of soundcraft like the warbly watery too latter are just shorn of the static that used to act as their protective skin coxs lyrics are the same blend of impenetrable anxiety ( found money and fame / but i found them really late he ruminates in ) and cryptic references but theyre delivered in his strongest cadence yet suddenly able to adopt a number of personae from folky strummer to rockabilly crooner (complete with slapback echo) he gleefully toys with his own outward personality it comes to a head on the stunning a harpsichord lovesong with soaring vocals unlike anything weve ever heard from cox its one of the most gorgeous songs hes ever written and one of the few moments on where cox is giving us a piece of himself without any kind of pretense even though we get cox at his most nakedly audible on however it still feels like hes putting on a show or imitating someone else just look at the cover hes there but hes dressed up in a guise holding a vintage microphone over the course of his third solo album thats essentially what we get hes a damn good performer after all his vocals are stronger his melodies are better and his instruments cleaner but hes replaced the intense and fascinating introspection with something that feels less honest its an uncomfortable trade-off but not an entirely dissatisfying one: it just leaves with the lingering aftertaste of transition a solid album pointing at a new direction but not quite sure how to get there yet
are next in line for and they deliver 2 nice pieces of work in gravity drop and fusion the thumping kick is what you will first hear on the a-side of s gravity drop the hats and smooth growling baseline then enter the fray as the track gains intensity a breakdown midway introduces an african vocal chant that merges with the beats shortly after to create the meat of this production not bad at all on the flip is fusion the drums gain intensity and twisted effects are used quite well throughout a chugging baseline is employed and soon thereafter a melodic horn of some sorts takes control a smooth track and quite a welcome b-side to an impressive release
richard presents his first single from his new artist album lucky strike called on well known for his rock-dance hybrid sound and with a large amount of production work behind him has carved out a niche for himself in the ever-changing world of electronic music remix efforts come from dean coleman and samio mrn the original is a vocal driven moody house track utilising mellow synths and piano riffs the distinct vocal flows continually throughout the track which is quite short keeping things simple and effective with a couple of nice little breakdowns featuring the mellow synths s pink noise extended mix lifts the feeling up and extends on the original with the addition of a stronger beat and a variety of catchy guitar riffs rasping percussion and the original mellow synths add a nice build to the track before the vocal is introduced probably a more club friendly mix than the original with the extension adding areas for effective mixing nicely done coming into dirty the place up the dean coleman remix delves straight into the depths of gritty house with upfront drums ribbing basslines and tribal percussion the original mellow synths are introduced early to tee up the start of the vocal but the production takes on a new form as dean puts his own twist to the melody the groove is everlasting as a great array of effects a drop of percussive madness and a massive vocal breakdown definitely fills the senses as the track reaches the business end of the mix and pores on all elements an insane mix and brilliantly done the dean coleman dub is yet another excellent example of deans skills as he utilises a more tribal sound with deep sustained synths the perscussion from his remix still remains and the mellow synths are very versatile without the vocal though the vocal gets the full effects treatment the tough drums really come out in this dub and is quite varied from deans remix another great production as we round out the mixes the samio mrn underbrown mix grabs a slab of deepness and turns in a solid piece of melodic progressive house the beats are direct and sharp along with an aggressive distorted bassline nice sampling of the vocal are littered throughout but its the mood and sounds that are the highlight here sounding more on the futuristic tip the track remains quirky until it reaches a big breakdown that features more of the emotive mellow synths and a touch of weirdness lots of really nice samples are played which are then met by the bassline and create a huge stir as it builds into the beat solid to say the least i wasnt quite sure what to expect from this release this may have given me an even chance into reviewing it with an open mind the remixes for me have really boosted this collection dean colemans dirty house mixes are superb and the samio mrn progressive take is top notch if your not into the vocals or the original look ahead and try out the mixes
staying in the 2008 debut of oslos born joachim dyrdahl exemplified the most playful end of that most luxe of electronic styles: frosty scandinavian house albums title track was built on keyboards that wobbled around the tune as much as they played it i was go to marrocco and i dont see you [sic] was built on charged riffing somewhat reminiscent of ed banger except that it evoked little fluffy clouds rather than beards and black leather; skinny bass tones frazzled keyboards and occasional whooshes made interpolation both a wink at electro and a relaxed example of the style dyrdahl wasnt kidding about any of what he did but he certainly wasnt stone-faced about it either by contrast is far more consciously epic a mantle dyrdahl wears well re are lots of details to bear down on here but the overall feel of the thing is what matters its less of a collection of songs (or tracks sure) and more of a suite which isnt to say it lacks definition each of the eight cuts sprawls in its own distinct way its less cute than the debut though it still twinkles brightly albums title translates in glish to a happy time so score one for truth in advertising even when things get a little dark the ominous organ chords that saturate the first two minutes of for example a sprightlier keyboard hook chimes in and sets things back on path like much of has a simple brightness that doesnt so much belie all the cosmic synth quasi-futurism dyrdahl puts on display as offsets it charmingly aptly titled opener and shifts gear a lot (the limpid keyboard lines are out-liquefied by percussion so heavily treated it can seem tongue-in-cheek) as does the closing inner-space flight of which sounds like something carl sagan thought up in a dream blips that make up the tune (and a good part of the rhythm though lord knows the handclaps do their part on that end) of have some texture to them for sure but theyre excitants first; ditto the rubbery 303s on rosenrod its a head-turning piece of work
after making a few appearances on andy blakes now-shuttered dissident label in 2008 aka ewan willmott and lydia jones pretty much went silent returning to the world late last year on the maxi-single for lana del reys video games of all places the project is back in earnest with an ep for the perennially on-point unless their dissident sides never dislodged themselves from your memory (or for that matter if youre an ldr completest) your interest may initially be piqued by theo s two remixes on the b-side because well its theo but youd be a fool to sleep on the a: its there that originals lie and they truly steal the show and are at their heart pop music albeit of a sort youre not likely to hear on any mainstream fm station save those of you whove found a wormhole to 1986 the former spends most of the track fighting back against downtrodden wurlitzer chords at a breakdown halfway through as the keys begin undulating the clouds seem to have finally parted only to once again fall into a minor key still its not so much bummed as it is serious with a virtuosic bassline hammering home the funk traverses similar but more anthemic terrain breaking down longer and finishing bigger than its counterpart though never at the expense of its shuffling grid-skirting beat s two remixes are certainly no slouches but in bringing the original material so firmly over into his universe its like has been filched from a ghettoblasters tape deck and implanted into s cerebral cortex hes scrubbed out something of the originals charm in the context of a dj set with the selectors hands superglued to the eq they probably sound unstoppable but taken on their own terms originals will charm you to the end of the earth
the second 12-inch from young londoner jeremy duffy (so thats the monikers excuse) is pretty unabashedly romantic obviously there are the lovelorn vocal snippets ( you i love you ) not to mention the way jeremy duffy treats them by giving them just enough soft focus to make them seem tantalizingly out of reach ut the tracks impulses tug at one another in a fascinating way on the one side the bass line is so slow so mournful that it moves the track along with real heft; on the other the keyboards and percussion are so itchy they seem to be jumping off the rest of the music yet everything meshes; this sounds like an anthem is neater and straighter than but theres a rolling undercurrent to the beat here wind-and-stop bassline sped-up funk snares and hi-hats that ties it to earlier jungle without going much more in the direction of something like on-u sound sonically the jumble of voices in both the rising oh oh chant that provides the main hook and the muttering that surrounds it (we hear the word ganja most prominently of course) are handled with a deft touch
nyone following io (mulen) john dimas and sublee might think were in the midst of a tech house revival bstract minimal the kind associated with ricardo villalobos and rhadoo is almost a thing of the past making way for electro-tinged sounds (spacetravel onur zer binh) purist tech house or something more melodic (barac melodie) tech house bomb the title track from makcim levis new ep for is rowdier than the music of io (mulen) or dimas but like much of their work its held together with a fat bassline where others making loopy music decorate their tracks with delicate atmospherics makcim levi put all the attention on a pumping low-end throwing open hi-hats a snare vocal snippets ( whoa ) and the occasional cymbal crash on top is an ambitious tune but makcim levis classy execution makes it a safe option for djs eyeing a big moment the b-side is more subdued is goofy yet considered full of cartoonish sci-fi sounds and perlon-style whispered vocals dont be surprised if you hear zip play it is s most laid-back track a 00s-style deep house groover that rounds out another solid 12-inch from a label breathing new life into loopy house music
s overlooked but stunning debut ep last year on boxcutters kinnego label was a gorgeously downcast take on the miami vice synth-pop revival thing thats been going on the past few years mixing romantic melodies with vintage drum machine sounds scotsman michael rintoul returns a year later on hotflush with a slightly more assertive sound that suits him just as well mostly gone are the sensual vocal whispers that emphasized s pop slant replaced on the stellar lead track by mumbled vocoders its a decisive track with an infectious main riff that recalls early depeche mode all executed with rintouls usual delayed-gratification dynamics and cavernous atmospherics the gentle continues with the vocoder coos its lush pads hinting at adult contemporary territory the two tracks on the flipside are much more in line with what we might consider bass music than rintouls earlier material the needlepoint skip of hinting at recent sepalcure and the thumping his own take on the swanky digital funk that seems to define the american west coast these days on explores new territory and while he might have sacrificed some of what made his debut so distinctive when those synth chords twinkle like stars in the night sky in the fading outro to its difficult not to be swayed by rintouls musical sweet nothings
lots of new hybrid club music sounds like hollywood sound design put to a beat james b stringer makes this explicit his latest album as criticises the mass medias current obsession with survival playtime through which the imminent destruction of the human race is packaged as entertainment in films and video games unfortunately stringer doesnt really have the technical chops to execute this idea compared to the ultra-hd foley found in your average blockbuster his debut sounds like an amateurish mess but the sense of clammy-palmed panic comes through loud and clear stringers previous two releases have been described as apocalyptic and dystopian and is his most convincing depiction yet of a hyper-technologised world meeting a sticky end its 13 short chaotic tracks are segued together as if in a fever dream drums twitch convulsively like the bodies of grime and hip-hop in their death throes melodies bubble up and then disintegrate and synth horns belch ominously before being shredded in whirlwinds of digital shrapnel stringers artist name comes from a novel by new weird author china mi ville and his productions view electronic music through a similarly weird lens the old ground rules are warped or discarded; certainties melt away leaving a mess behind for most of this frantic thrashing around doesnt really go anywhere every track is packed with ideas but heavy compression and the tinny graunch of digital processing algorithms give them all a flat uniform sheen its not until track seven that something jumps out of the speakers: a turbulent ocean of sirens and jackhammer drums stringer keeps it up through the more melodic which appears to sample the cheeky song (touch my bum) and then 40 seconds of pitch-shifted crowd noise that starts as a glutinous puddle and ends sounding like a thousand tiny people hammering on your eardrums from there stringer loses direction again the sheer density of his music is its most interesting quality but also a weakness like the panicked crowds filling the streets in your favourite disaster movie stringers tracks run in a hundred directions at once and ultimately get nowhere if were all going to die anyway then getting in a flap about it isnt going to help
whilst some producers find their sound and continuously release only slight variations upon it others prefer to explore what they can conjure up with their gear constantly charting new areas despite releasing records under his own name for a little over a year martin has been responsible for a varied output that has included deep vocal house dry minimal techno and mechanical tech house his latest track on diynamic finds the producer mining new territory with an understated pearl of a minimal latin house track possessed of a faultless groove layering smart claps and snare fills atop a warm circuitous bass leaks scraps of the melody into the track as it builds before introducing the vocal hook without an ounce of aggression or any sharp edges at all really s mix is an innocuous roller for dance floor frivolity muted buzzing of the spanish horns will evoke memories of a certain gypsy-house hit that heated up the clubs and divided opinions late last year however the comparison is borne more out of both tracks utilising an ethnic theme rather than any direct similarity rgy well and truly takes line honours however with his hypnotic twisting jungle remix that loses the kitschy horns and lands you high up along an incan trail condors screeching and cattle bells ringing out in a south merican echo chamber subtle melodies worm their way beneath the burrowing bass line adding further to your subliminal susceptibility to the tripped-out sounds being toyed with some tracks summon atmosphere succinctly and rgy does so here with finesse even coaxing the shakers to sound like black crickets chirping at night
individually francis harris and anthony collins the guys behind moody indie-house label scissor thread already have an impressive body of work behind them as a team they seem to enhance each others strengths if anything its a shame its taken them this long to start regularly collaborating is the latest from both the label and partnership arguably marking the full maturation of both even before the plaintive vocal hits the tone of is set by heavily muted organs and saturated gloom when the vocal from bob moses does arrive it becomes almost nihilistic and yet despite this its undoubtedly a record that would work on the dance floor is atmospheric house at its most evocative completely at odds with the origins of the genre but utterly engrossing all the same treads a similarly downtrodden path with the same sullen subby throb and another gorgeously lovelorn vocal this time from julia static and distortion coat both the vocal and the percussion as if theyve been ripped from an ancient piece of vinyl if haunting yet warm house music is your thing youve come to the right place
michael baumanns second release for slots neatly into the vibe that dj koze and marcus fink have lovingly created for their label: house and techno that champions individuality in the case of that means sweeping deep house that stirs the soul with its strings evoking silicone souls right on right on and its bassline stretching and unwinding with a bungee-like elasticity dd in clanking cowbells and old school hip-hop radio shoutouts and youre left with something that should linger long in the memory baumann winds it back a notch on which floats by on an organ drone thats punctuated by claps soulful female vocals and shuddering bass prods the twist is unexpected the original elements stay intact but are soaked in syrupy disco guitar licks and tinkling glockenspiel it has the kind of quirkiness that meeting of dark and smooth which youd expect from koze himself

expanding on a strong foundation part 2 of offers five new cuts; one from american duo octave and two each from and steve clocking in at just over ten minutes long s first remix of the title track shows little patience for the originals lengthy lead notes instead he carefully selects from the supporting cast of brisk arpeggios and the like additionally he injects plenty of original stuff; sparkly chimes brief fizzes of synth and something that sounds like sleigh bells whereas watsons original was rather single-minded moves methodically through various sound combinations in the calmest of ways his second remix is titled an amusing label considering the minimalism of the other nonetheless it does live up to its name with the extra melodic elements left out this time what remains is the originals aqueous chiming and the aforementioned sleigh bells which rustle more than jingle watsons first offering will probably only interest djs billed as a dub of it removes a minutes worth of material and shuffles the structure a bit its hard to see why he bothered to include something so similar for this second package however nice it may be meanwhile is probably the most exciting thing here courting the jaunty optimism so often found on 90s records (or more recently mds it aint what it used to be ) a fuzzy bassline sets the pace with ghostly wails and glassy pings alternately stealing the stage from one another at 132 bpm its fast by todays standards but the sunny mood keeps things from turning savage with these factors in mind would seem perfect remix fodder for octave s energetic palette surprisingly the two brothers turn in a more pensive re-work amplifying the ghostly wails into a weakened spectre that hovers over the entire track however a speaker-busting kick compensates for the lower tempo and gentler synth work
was borne of personal and political upheaval last year alec storey aka spent the summer at his parents cottage in suffolk where part of the lp was recorded in that period his sense of dislocation was compounded by the uks decision to leave the european union and the withdrawal of fabrics license by islington council storey wrote three very angry tracks and all of which make the cut here in the days following the clubs closure they touch on techno electro and uk club music sources that has never explored with as much tangible feeling as on this lp other tracks bear this frustration more stoically on named after a beach in suffolk that storey visited as a teenager synths cascade over glimmering chords trembling bass and dense granular layers it doesnt evoke a sanctuary so much as the bleak beauty of an english coastline theres a similar quality to in which fibreglass arps are soothed by a soaring harmony tracks that reference and evoke harsh natural landscapes convey a distracted solace a feature of storeys music has been its attention to detail when als making a beat he gets that thousand-yard stare appleblim once said of his friend and collaborator on a track like that focus is invaluable the drums sampled from street drumming recorded in new york hare along at 155 bpm vocal snippets gasps russian-language speech a samuel l jackson sample punctuate the fluid rhythm the simple arps of or become thanks to canny harmonic layers dramatic and energising as a whole though the lp can seem uptight the drexciya-esque for all its excellent accents suffers for its unsatisfying melody the and whose rolling snare patterns echo uk funky are wrought with tension that has nowhere to escape the issue though is less about specific tracks than a general fatigue that such complex beats can bring there are simply too few hooks or hummable melodies that a lighter touch mightve made possible should club music influenced by distress be fun perhaps not and s most ably realised tracks arent hedonistic is typical of the lps emotional conflicts it rages with discordant noise but its bleeps and harmonies swell with sombre feeling is rich with ambiguity of being caught between states its an authentic response to an increasingly uncertain world
nyone can overlay loads of sounds and call it deep house nobody however can do it like this single is his first (remixes notwithstanding) output since sleeper last year and he doesnt disappoint pedigree in jazz both from his family and from his early ambient jungle-based productions has given him not only a talent with more tonal soulful side of dance but also ability to produce this type of stuff in an interesting innovative way the singles side is definitely its highlight steel drum-flavoured pattern bounces around playfully and shimmering cascades of fizzing build recede build recede n build and build and n whole thing drops into silence before exploding gently into a cloud of coloured bubbles its lovely and funky in equally large measures choppy backbeat similar to one in lsace but less driving pushes jazzy chords oscillate and a warm brief bass motif repeats without variation but se are only a foundation for o r features which come and go within an improvised ad-hoc structure raw late 80s handclaps a glass escalator of an arpeggio and a kind of skipping cd voice effect all make an appearance not to mention more subtle elements in pastiche which all drop in and out to give track its interest theres nothing as great as that steel drum pattern in lsace (few things are) but still hits spot and cerebrum
res a variety of ways that a label compilation can be h led label can reward/tease/infuriate the listener by offering strictly new material ( versatile 2008 cd1 on saturday im in love ) revisit known songs with the help of contemporary producers (cd2 on back to back volume ) focus simply on their long past or recent glories (most of rekids revolution ) or blending all those possibilities together (kill the djs on prend les m mes et on recommence ) for the second chapter of the systematic colours series systematics boss has opted for the more conservative approach for an 80 minute mix that is nonetheless as rewarding as it is instructive in terms of chronicling his own evolution as a dj producer a r maestro opening the album with what is probably the labels most iconic release is a bold move on the djs part especially since nothing after it will even come close to its brilliance first two minutes of stefan s version of the strange but strangely eloquent collaboration between r from 2007 are creepy desolate with what sound like a lone safety pin being shaken inside of a stainless steel box in the mariana trench (really); when the 4/4 beat actually kicks in its in an approximate shaky way which gives the entire track a humble almost fragile allure music thus serves as the perfect background for semi empathetic semi ironic tale about what appears to be a misanthropic cat/dog/rat/cockroach lady an un dance floor friendly topic if there was ever one yet remains one of those unlikely underground dance track that defines categorization generic boundaries affiliations this same perfect coherence between form content can be found again on another collaboration between himself a charismatic deep house singer this time detroits own legend simpler in its execution than with lyrics exhorting you to basically shake it in hmm the club this jubilant track is proof that electro house doesnt have to shed its credibility to fill the proverbial big room upon its inception five years ago s systematic was closely linked with the likes of get physical great stuff to the emergence of the so called german electro house sound with singles such as every day in my life (an early pairing of with the booka shake boys) or albums like dalhb cks man from the fall s own gemini but whereas great stuff have clumsily walked the fine line between powerful dance floor destroyers cheesy bombs get physical have diversified their sound palette the dusseldorf based producer his label have both stripped their sound in recent months to that modern sleek aesthetic that was always suggested by the its logo is best encapsulated by s racy remix of s s subtly melancholic or oxias broody take on s recent unsurprisingly the rest of the compilation mostly showcases the work of long time production partner who incidentally was in charge of colours volume one in the end then this compilation on top of reuniting you with some of the imprints more peripheral 12 inches ( vs feat kim d ) serves as a reminder that s label has a strong sense of direction consistency that hes always as potent as the people he surrounds himself with
ts been three years since the release of s much-derided second album temporary pleasures james d and jas shaw were upbraided for an over-reliance on star names and spreading them over an unholy mish-mash of styles frankly everyone involved sounded bored and uninspired irony was that d was making a great success of producing albums for indie heroes like rctic monkeys nd as former members of simian d and shaw had been riding the crest of a wave propelled by justices genre-fusing remix of we re r friends the finest indie/dance crossover record since the heyday of primal scream and happy mondays fight back began with 2010s delicacies round-up of the dark twisted techno eps put out on smds delicatessen label it went above and beyond in addressing critics part two of that fight back sounds like redemption attained res some cannily-woven sorcery at work here is very now yet by employing key electronic music touchstones it sounds classic as well just take r int opening up with a cut-up discofied vocal smd introduce blasts of huge trad chicago house synths and underpin it with a thumping bassline attack thats very bashmore r borrows from the looping peak-time style of french house masters while is four minutes of handsome techno soul with more than a hint of photeks mine to give t features a slo-mo acid breakdown of magisterial beauty and an emotionally wrought vocal sample of beatles muse-turned-cheesy-brit-tv-host cilla black not only is it evidence of expert crate-digging but an ability to wring soul from the unlikeliest of sources ts not just laser-guided club bombs though subliminally or not mimics orbitals bleepy robotic techno style; of the fishermans is a fizzing 8-bit exercise with off-kilter rhythms leaving decaying trails of electronic debris behind it like meteor showers n contrast nterference most willfully contemporary-sounding track is aimed directly at 2 m berghain crowds fusing echo-laden scuba-like bass thuds with spattering detroit techno drum patterns feels like s watershed moment y may have cool alt-pop friends but theyve gone with their heart by beating a path to the dance floor this is compelling proof theyve made the right choice
hun choi is one of those remarkable djs who can make any track sound like his his sets span decades and are often weirder than expected but they always sound like him his productions work the same way; there was something easygoing about records like tour de force and bobos alone in paradise but choi has kept quiet on the release front since 2012 focusing instead on his dj career and moving from berlin to la to amsterdam marks a turning point for choi after growing frustrated with the formulaic nature of straight-up house years ago he became pals with san proper and started working in his amsterdam studio re choi rediscovered how production could be fun and soothing when relieved of anyones expectations as a result sounds unconcerned with anything trendy or new you get the sense that dance music runs through chois veins as if it just flows from his fingers even when he doesnt channel it has a fair share of banging moments despite its laid-back demeanor grows into a full-throttle techno workout while is casually propulsive with its chipper percussion and killer synth noodling casual is the word for most of the lp; choi often sounds like hes simply scribbling over a rhythm track he seems to be making up the melodies of and the acid line on sensation as he goes along and having a whole lot of fun in the process choi also explores slower moods some relaxed ( ) some disconcerting (the smoky jazz murmur of ) but always with the same singsong simplicity that makes his productions so approachable on he delivers a majestic slow burn crafting something that would serve well both as a stirring set opener or an emotional end in fact its easy to imagine most of working in a set as long as youre an imaginative dj like choi tracks feel like extensions of the personality weve come to know over the past few years; is a great artist doing what comes naturally to him it might not be his most exciting work but its certainly his most personable after spending the last few years playing other peoples records choi has found a welcome new perspective on making his own

is the latest alias of glasgows al matthews who has explored technos rawer fringes through names like element abuse smear and more recently bleaching agent not to mention the collaborative projects forward strategy group and the soon-to-be-shuttered blacknecks here on the four-track the first release on the new leeds label records he turns in two crispy 4/4 cuts that are a tad tamer than the bruising stuff he usually puts out but theyre just as intriguing and even more catchy simmering title track is primed for djs who like long mixes it keeps things restrained across its more than eight-minute length with no-frills drums and chugging minor-key chords that add a poignant touch as they grow longer and sharper the records highlight at first seems to follow a similar trajectory as it stirs in some barely-there choral reverb but then it bursts into a middle section highlighted by an exuberant organ-like lead whose occasional sliding notes and key changes give the track a strangely blissful carnival-esque vibe kommune1s remix of is faster and sleeker as it puts bits of the originals chords lower in the mix with rushing drums its also more dynamic thanks to some neatly placed vocalizations (a common feature in kommune1s work) but it would be better off without all that atmospheric whooshing sunil s percussive take on is more deranged where parts of the s quirky lead come chopped up and re-looped with a few wailing sirens and plenty of sinister growling textures its something for more extreme sets
if jamie roberts ep as bored young adults was his first to withdraw into itself as ras ray philp wrote then his debut as turns his music inside out little of reaches even the level of restrained throb behind that record as roberts spends this six-track package slowly building from electrical hums and monotonous modular synth pulses compared to any blawan track the first two-thirds is especially abstract given to slow swells of noise and obscured percussion but its all rhythmic and alive by the time of and roberts return to techno conventions is less satisfying despite the strange noises he weaves through the beats has a way with withholding details and climaxes that brings to mind the likes of actresss r i p and basic houses releases for opal tapes the pattering hi-hat that skips through goes in and out of earshot as its smothered by a submerged kick and distant squalls while shivers in a cocoon of white noise before a melodys soft glow emerges the pieces are so textured and loose that they nearly feel organic could be an ultrasound beset by radio interference on the other hand is mechanical and droning serving as a bridge between s two poles the ground is sturdier on the farther end but the journey roberts took to get there is more compelling to revisit

frankfurt/santiagos uwe schmidt is nothing if not prolific a tireless innovator producing in numerous forms for numerous markets under numerous guises his output has slowed of late by just a mustache-hair with his latest disc (this time as atom ) apparently a labor of rumination soul-probing and one requiring quite a bit of research publishing their first schmidt product promises a romantic work one that negotiates dualisms of science and the irrational clarity and simplicity ornament and mathematic purity rooted in both the synthetic and the organic this recording is another example of the cliques preternatural knack for rich sound textures from droning sine waves that amass tactile rumbles to airy digital glitches that soothe like brushed snares the record is rich with elements that sound coolly programmed but so resonant full-bodied and even animate that they evoke like field recordings specific environments these are s most immediate pleasures after the quality and character of sounds used s defining feature is its mining of a romantic past in a musical setting that we prefer to liken to the future much of the album flirts with mannerism from the gentle waltz rhythms of und to the stately motifs that color the quilts of white noise ( wei es ) t is though easy to overstate this point; this is also a record that fashions a not-terrific dub rhythm out of the familiar sound distortion heard when certain gsm phones receive calls near computer speakers the returning motifs may play some part in structuring the album but to me their intermittent appearance sounds more like a picking up of threads lost in pursuit of other muses (muses like the phone glitch effect) sort of a now where were we this push-and-pull of focused intent and playful curiosity of the cerebral and the intuitive sometimes works fantastically the delicate dance is after all lead by a composer who changes styles more often than most of us change records schmidts kitchen-sink synthesis of genres is seamless but its also conspicuous as hell and frankly can be an acquired taste the playfulness is great at beating back the doldrums of lazy passive listening but for all that the music at times claws for recognition of its own eccentric quirkiness much of s idiosyncrasy is a byproduct of its ambition parades the sort of easy familiarity with precedents in physics philosophy programming poetry and pop music that one typically saves for a graduate dissertation rather than a half-hour techno record provokes the listener not only to concentrate but to decipher this isnt to say that you cant put on to pass time on the train t is however an album whose meaning changes significantly depending on its audiences familiarity with the contexts it cites for my part the challenge was appealing but whether a function of differing tastes or relative ignorance often felt like was missing half the message
when we last heard from irish producer rendan gregoriy k he was contributing the sparkling tightly wound under the slip to kompakts speicher 76 this ep his first for josh winks ovum since 2007s superb umbrella finds the cork-born producer offering a track as inspired as either of those records shimmering 12 minutes of deep techno is the kind of gorgeously layered journey that leaves you delighting in new elements several listens in fluttering luminous synth chords a spongy bassline punching claps and snares a velveteen bed of ascending pads gregoriy distills them into something almost celestial doesnt quite scale the same heights but is an enjoyably thrumming techno track nonetheless it has a buzzing insectoid bassline over which tetchy drums and a bass loop skitter restlessly its the kind of thoroughly effective late night tool that gregoriy has been reliably turning out throughout his career
s dubstep fragments and evolves theres a very clear idea of what traditional or orthodox dubstep is supposed to sound like namely brooding subtle and weighty with a clear sense of space and restraint ut for all the supposed kicking against the pricks this sort of music can be just as dishearteningly formulaic as its brostep enemy thankfully we have djs like youngsta who with his rinse cd earlier this year reminded us that even the most dubstep of dubstep can still be home to experimentation new label run out of londons infamous lackmarket soho record shop makes this its mission hearkening back to the times when dubstep felt like the weirdest most alien music around like most of the stuff youngsta pushes these days has an almost techno sheen the duo of strago and snooks abandon that primitive and cavernous dub sound for sleek aerodynamics as chords swell larger and larger over the horizon bursting through as erupting pustules of putrid lfo its a level of filth that the midrange wobblers could only hope to achieve partly because it only happens a few times in the track feels like an unstable upgrade on classic mala with melodies stumbling and drums trembling so intensively that you fear (and hope) they will collapse in on themselves at any moment unabashedly modern but refreshingly backward-looking in its execution the first release from offers an intriguing alternate answer right here to the always nagging where next question
the two-part re series for s wicker steel concludes with contributions from walls tvo and tengui while the first eps re es are shorter and more club-oriented this second set plays like a cohesive journey split into four lengthy atmospheric pieces kompakts walls start things off with their slowly-building take on extracting some words and vibes from s original and re-contextualizing them within an inviting blend of big basslines and breezy melodic swirls which previously received a dense stepping makeover from sigha and truss shows up again twice here courtesy of broken20 boss tvo pushing the tempo below 115 bpm and conjuring brooding chords and strange radio messages both free re and cherry re expand in markedly different ways: the former rides out a swaggering beat while the latter leaks bits of reverberated acid and 808 percussion tenguis interpretation of winds down the ep stripping the original version of its sulking machinery and leaving behind a toxic soundscape filled with low electrical hum its a stunning coda for a re es package that at 35 minutes in total length can stand alone as its own album experience
started out in 2003 focusing on breaks but nowadays the musical focus is a fusion of deep house with the odd techno splash the directional change was signalled in 2005 with will saul s well-received album space between moving the label and saul himself towards more soulful and melodic sounds for this release saul is joined by occasional studio partner tam cooper but with sideshow and elusive remixer konrad drafted in for remixes this looks like a varied offering with only a handful of remixes under his belt wagon repairs konrad is at present an in-demand producer who seems to only come out of the shadows every now and again here his eerie electro recalls oliver huntemann or perhaps the hacker and it will excite newer fans of the genre but it s a little too familiar for my liking new simple addition sideshow s dubbed-out remix works much better skankin along nicely in a rhythm sound manner without having to try too hard but it s the lush synth melody of the original which has me nodding the most here it s an uplifting purposeful house track containing traces of former glory days while simultaneously sounding fresh forgive me for being old-fashioned but sometimes if it aint broke with these offerings as well as sebo k and spirit catcher s recent great remixes on the label perhaps a little experimentation is the latest tactic simple is employing
it might be true that technos best moments are behind it but that doesnt mean we cant enjoy those moments again and again each new one a slight mutation of its predecessor a rare foray by outside his subject detroit homestead is full of such moments the track titles here tell you a lot of what you need to know regarding approach and technique the three strains on offer are varieties of the same mutant form: pounds away with a powerful kick and a jacking bass sounds like a cosmic barrel organ played by androids on a parallel world thats all too easy to imagine while combines the bass of and the discordant electronics of to produce a track that has two lovely layers the space between which is cleverly manipulated call me a romantic but an important aspect of techno is that it must sound otherworldly hypothetical in the best sense bones music takes you to a dark place where there is a lonely strobe buckling under the weight of machine funk and electronic soul the three pieces on are a great sample of what the man is capable of and a feather in the cap of
originating out of karlsruhe a little town in west germany kristian beyer and frank wiedemann a k a me have surprised many with their self titled album hailing off the well known jazzanova label ame (french for soul) take their music seriously heavily influenced by the detroit new york and paris scenes their mission is to explore soulful tunes far and beyond the reaches of normal house and electronic music this cd blends the sounds of electro with deep-tech house creating an atmosphere all their own reminiscent of there earlier work and tastes of fellow label mates and highly respected jazzanova already releasing a string of 12 releases kristian and frank first met up through various gigs and later on kristian record shop plattentasche described as dance music with brains starts the cd of well with a deep number orchestral fills over mellow percussion and moving female vocals the next few tracks follow the same vein has a nice acid layer over a quirky percussive loop and epic electro sounds stand outs for me were a first-class tune with its electro-violin melody reminiscent of the good old beverly hills cop tune with techy fills layered over a wicked voco-beat and deep rumbling baseline sasari is on a funkier tip with plenty of blips and breaks to keep the cd travelling the beat reminding me of lance desardi or metro area while the bouncy baseline and techy - electro fills add credit to this late night jingle also a nice beat with typical air sample kicks synth stabs build an atmospheric background that creeps in leading into a nice breakdown the bass line in this one stands out with sub bass low-fi sounds hitting you right in the pit of the stomach the cd starts deep and moves towards more techy sounding tracks these boys are heavily influenced by the likes of moodyman underground resistance and carl craig from the motor city as well as the new york sounds of blaze and metro area and it shows with tight production skills backed up by a range of eclectic sounds generally this cd is similar to most of the minimal electro - house tunes coming out of germany lately effectively sounding like releases from naked music or 20:20 vision id recommended it for chilling out or sitting back and watching the sunset

visionists stellar imprint has been traversing the same terrain as recent efforts by keysound namely tapping into a new generation of uk producers who are channeling the best of grime and dubstep into hard-hitting dance music irish producer fits well among this group he marries grimes bone-dry slam with its melodic playful side which was especially evident on last years quartz his debut for retains this sensibility its hard to tell if is joyous or violent the hard-nosed rhythms cut sharp and severe feel deadly serious but the bleeping sounds that blurt out like popping water balloons are almost comical visionists hard-as-diamond remix throws humour out the window coating the snares in toxic dust and simplifying the track into a bludgeoning weapon drops off heavily filtered chords into dead silence luring you into free fall between every bar before pushing back up again with hard-panned drums is cut from the same cloth this time on a stuttering beat more wood than metal but its got the same mix of slamming rhythms and chirpy beeps

based in france and broadcast in paris and other french cities radio nova presents its listeners with an eclectic range of dance music covering a wide spectrum of house jazz hip hop nu-jazz and electro-pop genres nova tunes is radio nova s showcase compilation taking a selection of the station s grand mix and its ninth volume takes pieces from the likes of alex kid lyrics born chicks on speed and many others just a sample of what can be heard alex kid starts off the compilation with an uptempo broken beat groove on come with me featuring the sweet whispery vocals of lisette alea it s a fusion of jazz and funk coupled with bouncy grooves and a nice syncopated beat motor city provide a smooth remix to metropolitan jazz affair s yunowhathislifeez paying homage to the acid jazz days back in the mid nineties funky bass and solemn trumpets provide a nice backdrop to the male vocals lacing the track count indigo looks back towards the 70 s for trinity (bringing out the devil) he s the english curtis mayfield think big orchestral arrangements funky guitar riffs disco beats and he even sounds like the 70 s soul icon on a more laidback tip are tracks like oscar brown jr s blues and soul piece brother where are you featured here remixed by matthew herbert my room by the marathonians provides a summery reggae flavour to the compilation lilly dale by arthur h provides a more sublime and relaxed mood to the cd deep male vocals sung in french backed by a melancholic guitar are the theme for this tune covering the hip hop genre is lyrics born whose bad dream is one tasty chunk of hip hop funk mixed in with a lot of soul from the uk is ty on wait a minute taking hip hop to a new level by fusing hip hop mc-ing with upbeat latin rhythms soulful jazzy vocals while he tackles issues regarding relationships general electrics take you out tonight is by a french expat in san francisco who has collaborated with the quannum collective if you don t get their hints by now it s lateef the truth speaker from latyrx and maroons take you out tonight sits on a funky laidback 70 s vibe heavy on the hammond organ with a male vocalist singing in high spirits while lateef is in his usual good form on the mic on a more abstract hip hop tip is the big picture by izzy dunn which sees the cellist combining elements of hip hop beats with soulful vocals while she uses her cello to create deep melodies a big surprise (for me anyway) comes from the chicks on speed whose usual uptempo electro pop stylings are set aside for a little samba flavour on coventry the demise of eclectic compilations in the past like rebirth of cool has meant that the joining of forces between the artists above would be hard to come by especially since dance music is starting to get more genre specific as can be witnessed by a lot of compilations thankfully this isn t one of those ibiza labelled chill out compilations but more a true eclectic compilation featuring radio nova s highlight tunes from their 2003 playlist even though i didn t find every single song appealing there s definitely something in here for people with a palette for good music

a few years ago told ra how they approach writing music: we [have] a sound in our heads for the tracks a lot of texture and grit but no external concept its how we always work but part of that has changed last years struggle emerge for the netherlands institute sound and vision was part of a project that used field recordings and archival footage to explore the dutchs relationship to water uses sound to explore the different reactions and emotional responses to the current world climate of chaos and uncertainty the music wont explicitly make you think trump and brexit but the concept guides into interesting sonic themes the record has a pristine sense of space its narrative alternating between ethereal and discordant the soft and are sophisticated and emotionally deep skeletal percussion outlines an interior world while billowing ambiance and celestial voices fill it with longing and are beatless sound sculptures derived from similarly degraded textures but a subtle difference in tone makes the former angry and the latter soft and kind highlighting the thin line between those moods
catalonias electronic music community is closely knit and the badalona-born (real name pau soler) seems to have all the usual connections with john talabot and the hivern discs crew among them this is his second ep after last years a soundless echo and it finds him fleshing out the house-meets-r b sound that record the best moments on come when soler presses the euphoria button - is a good example he rolls sparkling keys and chimes smooth bass and r b chants into an enveloping blanket thats a pleasure to get lost in of achieves a similar if more techno-leaning result by heaping vocal fragments clicking percussion and sunny little melodies onto a monolithic bass groove elsewhere is what might happen if boards of canada had a new order-style ibiza epiphany and went balearic while is rote choppy garage closer meanwhile is an ambient wash thats punctuated rather prettily by woodblocks tambourines and the by-now formulaic r b-flavoured vocal shards
continuing from where the previous ended presents the second installment of its alternative mood music releasing the first volume as a tease in limited numbers gu s interpretation of the afterhours certainly showed that the label and its compilers were diverse in their appreciation of the weird and the wonderful so do you like the sound of trafik no i don t mean the sounds of horns or sirens blowing along an intersection i m speaking of the producers djs singers artists that comprise one andrew archer and one john elliot in-house producers who do everything but the laundry for the label takes helm on compiling and mixing two silver disc that looks to continue a new tradition for the escapes already breaking free from any pigeon-holing with bullet trafik s eclectic taste in music would be the foundation that makes up afterhours 2 overseeing the new project trafik was given the task to mold and shape the second volume of s alternative experience for a moment forget about the clubs or even the women and concentrate on a musical journey that will become the soundtrack to your life for the next wee hours as trafik are sonically displaying their definition of what the mean to them and when this is through so will it be yours a fusion of tim burton-like dreams washing over the starry nights of van gogh masterpieces you get a sense of entering a different world where darkness is just as intense and serene like sunlight opening with the ambient waves of olvis the sea you would have never noticed that by the time it drifts away and those broken beats crash in four other songs have gone by trafik s rearrangements are superb as you can never tell when a track finishes and the next one enters in trip-hop beats influencing the tempo you find that the groove is wickedly sinister; something cool but not necessary groovy in the usual way by the time boards of canada enters the fold you become indulged in some of electronic music most blissful sounds; quiet and siren this is ambient music made for the in mind the highlight of the first disc would have to be right at the end with its throbbing vibes courtesy of tricky and martina topley-bird switching in after is the forth s into the outside that will introduce trafik s very own surrender one of the highlights of bullet the green ice mix incarnation is haunting and beautiful while the closing piece for disc one over the pond by the album leaf ends this on a sad note that somehow fits perfectly in the while the first disc took on the sadcore nature that can be found in the disc two sees the more upbeat and twisted side taking on a more experimental route you become reminded a bit of charlie may s technodubfest with the bouncy hip-hop inspired rhythms and metallic melodies what does feel awkward is right at the height of the second disc it becomes a very dancey album not that it s a bad thing but that it only stays this way for roughly three tracks and then returns to its experimental selections it would have been nice if it were extended with some more tracks that remind the listener of the 80 s love-of-synthfest because it gets very very funky during visage s fade to grey to telefon tel aviv s my week beats your year not a bad disc but the first is where you re money will go to it s a strange feeling but it s right you have to give it to them; though these sounds have been explored by others like warp before them the presentation captures the feelings and moods that define the ; somewhere calm but not chill dark and twisted with a majestic black rose cementing its alluring nature you must wonder what must go inside the mind of someone who creates sounds like this this music isn t made for the mainstream and for most people they may never hear music quite like this and with the compilers trafik pulling no stops to search for gems that seemed to be impossible to find; music that sleeps in the cracks of the world if people like trafik and labels like gu didn t take a chance to explore new terrain all that would be left are commercial records done chilled style for purposes of now that s what i call chillout music vol 100 or use every other downtempo track that s been used a hundred times prior and repackage it under a different umbrella to trafik and gu the more or less is neither a place nor time it is wherever you want to be at whatever moment you feel it s an attitude and an understanding that sometimes you just want to let go i agree the you really need to experience it for yourself tracklisting: cd1 01 olvis - the sea 02 penumbra deep listening 03 stef pako frederick - magic shop (trafik aftercuts edit) 04 slam - kill the pain 05 7 hurtz - 3 sisters 06 sissy - i see you (dub mix) 07 boxsaga - steppin 08 spanna phere 09 7 hurtz pump 10 psycorps collusion 11 boards of canada - amo bishop roden 12 the aloof ft ricardo nicolia - on a mission 13 burnt friedman - ive got my love to keep me warm 14 k-roxx grand 15 roxy music - in every dream home a heartache 16 tricky hollow 17 the forth into the outside 18 trafik - surrender (green ice mix) 19 the album leaf - over the pond cd2 01 unkle - i need something stronger 02 colder- one night in tokyo 03 cotton belly tempest dub 04 primal scream jailbird (weatherall dub chapter 3 mix) 05 dub chemist wobbly 06 rockers hi fi - push push (re-rub) (trafik aftercuts edit) 07 nush - nush (trafik aftercuts edit) 08 leonine - wrong intentions 09 murcof - memoria (sutekh trisagiorion mix) 10 dominik eulberg - der zug der kraniche:boten der ver nderung 11 visage - fade to grey (trafik aftercuts edit) 12 psychonauts - empty love 13 telfon tel aviv - my week beats your year 14 murcof memoria 15 trafik - echoes (petter slow dub) 16 jon hopkins circle 17 closer musik - one two three (ewan pearson mix) 18 sinner dc alice 19 subside - home to an empty house 20 beanfield - tides ft bajka (accapella)
long a trio s second full-length sees them appropriating longtime collaborator the mole as a fourth member but it seems theres a bit of slippage here in the band name department the foursome have already toured as but now this epithet gets shuttled to album title while the moniker remains in force either way modern deep left quartet about sums it up: cobblestone explores the terrain of deep house through the eyes of a jazz improv group although considerably edited down s tracks have always reflected the organic energy of the group jam sessions that spawn them curiously the addition of another member to the mix has resulted in a more pared-down sound than before the quartet here operate with a sense of intuitive restraint breezy and sleek more minimal and hypnotic whether conscious or not this sonic shift seems like it must have induced a certain amount of rigor when it came time to choose album tracks youll note for example the absence of their recent banger traffic jam and the presence of its spacier b-side instead its an unexpected call and the records all the better for it traffic jams big drums and broad party vibe would have been out of place here and packs its own punch albeit of the more bugged disorienting variety is the heaviest thing going here providing some girth to a relatively taut and compact collection and child open the lp as twin dollops of floaty jazz-tinged house but the tracks that follow demonstrate how cobblestones mo isnt simply restricted to the skilled use of standard deep signifiers the next two tunes for example build up nicely to the climax by flexing a bit more robot muscle exudes a nearly rap-style gruffness with vocoded vocal taunts full-frontal bass and even yes the me love you long time sample made popular by 2 live crew all propelled by a downwardly-spiraling chord change the playful rugged relies on a stiff robotic funkiness with a big wobbly hand-played bass and affectless vocoder vocals intoning cave man cromagnon man in fact the vocoder gets a good amount of play throughout showing off a surprising diversity not only taunts here and machinic recitations there but full-bodied emotions on the soulful as well cobblestones gone and buried this tune one of the records most melodically infectious numbers towards albums end just before the outro once again thoughtfulness at the expense of predictability pays off backending allows its seductive charms the lulling robo-singing the smoky rhodes riffage to unfold their magic at a much more leisurely pace and keeps the records second half just as warmly engaging as the first
heres a record you didnt see coming: jorge velez doing nosebleed techno velez under a variety of guises has turned his hand to italo disco drone ambient and of course the rugged analogue house hes best known for but nothing this intense is quite a leap but its one that velez makes with ease as if hes been doing this stuff forever drums aside sounds as if its being played from inside a tin can (but its a lot better than that sounds) the synth melodies are shredded almost to oblivion but the refrain thats left is the eps highlight again employs thin metallic scraps of sound but a looping one-note chord and a steady 909 make it a little less prickly the testiness doesnt let up on which bubbles almost to boiling point with sharp sounds and bleeps but the eps truly paranoid moment is its manic shaker laid over a sickly ambient hum vibrates like the angry end of a rattlesnake on a big rig itll have bite
the third installment in rvng intl s commend see series is s first proper solo album the berlin-based artist has a decades-long history with experimental music and art playing in bands exhibiting in galleries around the world and exploring her fascination with field recordings at length the solo music shes released through the various temporary archives accounts ( youtube bandcamp etc ) works elements of her background in sound art into a more tuneful and electronic-based approach a 20-minute recording velarde uploaded to soundcloud just before the end of juxtaposes long unspooling synth compositions with nature sounds not unlike anthony childs maui jungle records comes out of a similar mindset trading the natural textures for more layers of analog warmth birds quietly chirp in the peripheries of and voices drift through as ghostly blurs but otherwise these ten pieces are more or less synths and drum machines wrapped in subtle tape hiss the musics timbral qualities are plenty engrossing and the way velarde loosely arranges her instruments only amplifies the allure arpeggiations swirl kaleidoscopically in as harmonies flicker in the distance and pockmarks of distortion crinkle on the surface then inverts the piece as a sort of surreal synth pop bringing structure to the mercurial tones with a soft bass pulse and cyclical drum patterns the beatless lilts and glimmers as it floats in the air while bobs hypnotically through interwoven loops with their one-word titles and uninterrupted flows each song feels like a living world unto itself non-electronic instruments also surface throughout the album a piano is buried in a detuned guitar jangles in and faint resemblances of horns chimes strings and woodwinds appear they bring a sense of reality and humanity to the boundless otherworldly music coming from an artist who has long been interested in location-specific recordings and performances sounds surprisingly placeless and somewhat remote but in creating her own spaces for a change velarde has uncovered somewhere well worth inhabiting
pick out any track from rupert parkes 1994-1997 run and you will likely have a classic on your hands but there are classics and then theres traenon the 1996 12-inch is an outlier in more ways than one it wasnt released on a drum bass label but through kirk degiorgios op-art just before parkes signed with virgins science sub-label it also features his first work with house and techno introducing the crossover recipe that would bring him near-mainstream fame a few years later parkes has more to thank degiorgio for than releasing the record the ep was made during a period in which parkes showed degiorgio how to make complex drum breaks and degiorgio gave parkes rare records to sample from the glow of degiorgios music informs traenon which stuns with cascading detroit techno melodies the drums flit like hummingbirds finding the balance between lightness and power that made photeks best material so intoxicating the downtempo is even more elegant showing the jazzier side of parkes artful slicing and dicing but this 12-inch is really about traenon extending it to nine minutes parkes replaces breaks with a techno kick drum and celestial snares that could have been lifted from warps early catalogue even without his signature breaks it carries the majesty of his best work which persists in the gorgeous sound design and drum patterns a british dance music masterpiece that sounds no less majestic than it did more than 20 years ago traenon is proof that photeks genius transcends genre
franco-american techno rockers claim to have had no idea of lou reeds widely derided and adored music album when coming up with a title for their latest full-length true or not there are clearly few comparisons between the two works reeds rasping drone-noise pieces sit on one side while s pulsating and short-attention span stadium techno sit near the diametric pole s entertainment for us quipped brian barton black one half of the duo in an interview dispelling any artistic pretence those familiar with the duos earlier work will know what to expect things didnt change much between their two novamute albums klunk and unhuman except the final product while those previous full-lengths had a tendency to blow it at the critical moment manages to ride through the potential crash points at high speed like a muscle car with a good spoiler s sound is unashamed unflinching and totally direct each track targets only dance floor workability at the expense of all else the overarching sounds are big brash techno which also means a healthy dose of trance aesthetics as well hold things in check throughout though with their frequent use of minimals more tightly coiled sounds there are many examples of this throughout but and drive home the point by using slowed voices that seem to pay homage to ambivalents r u ok the album launches into action with which works hard to set the scene but at times suffers from silliness fuzzy and growling the sticky speed changes here are just a stretch too much but what follows is better a long run of seamless and restless tracks propel you breathlessly to the albums single which almost seems heavy and sensible by comparison on its own the single easily dominates but against the run of rapid changes and hysteria of the opening tracks its big walloping changes seem almost dense other tracks work more effortlessly though the aforementioned rides precariously on a ridiculously pulsing bass while the bottom end of also bounces along tightly almost like kiss gone rave is perhaps the standout track fusing elements of both these two into a compelling and messy sky-high ride that is propulsive reckless and epic at over eight minutes entertainment can sometimes be a dirty word and the downside of all this mayhem is a certain lack of endemic intelligence and a comic book mentality lou reed and other goatee-stroking types wont feel too challenged here or even compelled to throw it on the stereo in the first place their loss is anothers gain (at least for the short term doesnt feel like something to come back to again and again ) is a blast and an enjoyable way to lighten up throw some spice into the mix and switch off
its been over two years since real name james wilson released a solo record hes kept busy in the interim with sporadic remixes collaborations and compilation appearances and now the londoner resurfaces with the spooks and thrills ep for his sound seems to have matured into something more distinctive than the average uk house and techno on records like 014s pressureface some of those references are still around check the high sustained strings in freak or s familiar vocal clips and warm keys and they work well as accents in wilsons hulking drum-centric bangers a lot of spooks and thrills sounds like randomer letting loose with some cheeky samples especially but don froths tool version of the track is less inspired unable to shake its strong similarities to this years woodwork in wilsons hands that percussive hard-hitting style contorts into exciting shapes thanks to an added sense of space and sly hints of nostalgia those tweaks are more than enough to keep spooks and thrills fresh and make fans hope its not another two years until the next record
res a seemingly endless debate about techno or dance music in general and how it can possibly marry dance floor functionality with home listening potential to produce a good album barcelona-based duo pablo bolivar and sergio aphro have passed such arguments with ir debut full-length despite being dub and beat-orientated its a pop album at heart sure re are ambient interludes in addition to obligatory intro track we have instrumental and two shorter tracks vocalless breakbeat s and blue moon doo-wop that act to join dots latter is so good that it begs for a full-length version but none less leads beautifully into guitar intro but its not just clever sequencing that makes stand out almost entire album has a gentle mood and yet still has enough variation to keep you engaged while s bro rhood collection showcased similar experimentation with different beat structures it didnt always pay f most notably on drum bass excursion streets calling me casts net just as wide drawing in slow minimal techno ( ) r b-sounding dubstep ( s t a r s ) and plenty reggae throughout though feels remarkably cohesive drawn in close to serve both individual tracks as well as album itself thats because production-wise bolivar has never been more astute embellishing every track with samples and a wealth detail that never seems fussy or ma matical sergio aphros vocals ride high in mix but are used to great effect on things like moving perhaps biggest surprise though is that re is no singular an m ala nospheratu or no meditation n again its hard to be a tall poppy in a blissfully big opium field
yet again display their ability to mix things up on their great label this time with a release by p c b entitled the dives into the quirky and dirty world of electro music the original mix is quite simply very chunky and heavy the electro baseline from the word go rumbles and shakes while the strong kick drum keeps the track rolling soon enough a filtered vocal tells a story and leads into the intense array of guitar riffs intense drum patterns and screeching effects it must be said that this may work quite well late on in a club atmosphere rather then a lazy sunday afternoon in the sun on the flip is the andrea doria mix which is just as intense as the original mix the beats for me are more interesting with nice bleeps and effects all while the electro base tones drive the track in the right direction the guitar riffs are lost in this remix as this production is entirely electro directed with driving dark synths and quirky effects devastating stuff a pretty intense release for mantra and one that is sure to work up some late night madness
is the collaboration of laurent garnier and llorca which immediately should arouse some level of interest with this release and to celebrate 10 years have re-released this classic release which includes 2 solid productions by the duo first up is 6 months earlier which is indeed a deep house anthem to many a smooth baseline is the feature here alongside nice drum patterns as well as electro vibes that feature throughout as well moaning about technology follows on the flip and it is quite a retro electronic outing wobbling baselines combine with a quirky spoken vocal as well as creep twisted effects and sounds a solid re-release from the f com boys and without doubt a release that will spark plenty of interests amongst the trainspotters
bipp felt outrageously twee when it dropped last year but with the rise of acts like a g cook hannah diamond and their pc music crew s music has a context: childlike hyperactive pop that some are labelling cute and others are aligning with the japanese idea of kawaii (see kyary pamyu pamyu who is now working with) lemonade is a dizzy love song cut from the same cotton-candy cloth as bipp only now its been deep fried and covered in icing sugar this twisted little banger is bound to turn many listeners off among its parts are high-pitched vocals barking out phrases like ca-ca-candy boys and synths that fizz like pop rocks hard meanwhile is a fisher-price grime tune built with stuttering drums and toy string instruments that pluck out its central melody the basslines almost seem too big for such a tiny framework and coupled with the hannah diamond-style vocal ( platform shoes kick so hard / ponytail yank so hard ) it sounds like a parody of machismo uk dance music both tracks are short but have brief surges in energy: a jittery synth run on hard and trance-inspired orchestral hits on lemonade you could make a whole tune out of just that last passage but for its a mere tangent its almost frustrating how quickly it disappears but then pop music is about instant gratification
brand new label delivers the goods with their first release a journey of a track from two of the breaks scenes most wanted meat katie elite force and what a track nu-tron is - a 3am-drug-induced-workout-lose-yourself-in-a-corner-dancing-like-a-mad-man-workout - tough techy breaks with building haunting synths gets things building chuck in some great vocal snippets and add a nice breakdown that culminates in a tough aural assault what a track flip it over for all night long which starts softly-softly with long drawn out synths and off-beat bass lulling the listener in to a melodic state of mind which soon changes when the beats finally come banging in things are again taken to another level after the drop the beats are toughened and the stuttering screaming vocal sample just makes the crowd go crazy a great debut for this label and another cracking release from mr katie and da force
ryan hunn hasnt been the easiest artist to follow since his debut in 2009 the englishmans work has stubbornly resisted categorization the broken hip hop of long live plan through the dubstep inspired dreamstealin and the mercurial dance floor bomb titan you could easily hear each of his releases as the work of a different producer if theres anything that binds his discography together its a love for the broken beat of hip hop often cushioned with the midrange fuzz of late 00s dubstep and a meandering style of melody but once he signed to in 2012 all that seemed to go away replaced by a taste for live (or sampled) instrumentation for anyone familiar with his work on other labels it could come as a shock just how delicate his debut album turned out with its film score strings and generally noir ish mood is an album that could soundtrack a trendy caf its lifelike textures such as the warbly organ and brushed drums on the title track use the palette of vintage hip hop but take all the edge off the right hands this would make for an excellent downtempo record but hunn doesnt seem to know where to take his songs would be highlight has the records best bassline and some of the old magic but its mallet heavy climax feels forced n it just stops three minutes in as if someone blew out the candle melodramatic vocal tracks don t feel any more substantial and the albums drab pallor is numbing sapping whatever impact these songs might have had though its never less than pleasant to listen to most of just isnt all that engaging it has beautiful soundscapes and bubbling synths but it still sounds slight as if hunn couldnt flesh out his ideas once he got them down he spent two years crafting the album but it seems like he spent too much time tinkering with the aesthetics of the record and not enough laying the groundwork for concrete songs as a result is a parade of pretty sounds without much to hold it all together
is a man of so few words yet so much emotion his career mirrors that of michael shumacher he is as the pinnacle of his profession and just when you think he can do no more he raises the bar just a little bit higher ( in roman numerals) is his latest offering in a period where the number of progressive releases seems endless there often comes along one mix that blows every other out of the water is one of them the first thing that will strike you is the fact that this is only a one cd release compared to the standard 2 cd release that we have come to expect and means that digweed has 70 odd minutes to portray his message does he achieve his goal let s indulge pollen s lonely planet is the all important opening delight hypnotic progressive at it s best with subtle yet a beautiful piano line pole folder and cp s dust follows with yet another masterpiece from the belgian duo a soothing aura with mesmerising vocals and when 5 minutes and 50 seconds pass you will know this is a classic when the most blissful of strings take the mix to another level mooger fooger by bermuda triangle is next with clattering drums meeting an outer space melody with delicate computerized vocal samples in the backdrop the mix still of which the pace is at an easygoing level is still in first gear we however are stepped up a gear with sean q6 thing rattling drums and funky baseline unite this is trademark digweed right here ladies and gentlemen the ever-impressive flash brothers make their mark with protect the senses another fantastic production from the boys from israel who have made their name known through melodic and spiritual house music over the last year or so a familiar name in darren emerson follows with his remix of te quiero s 108 grand - rolling baseline with building melodies exploding into a breakbeat climax the dub extravaganza of shakespeare s sister s black sky continues where 108 grand left off into a flurry of beats and sweeping strings digweed s stepped up yet another gear a familiar name in james holden treats us with one of his finest moments in the production studio i have put out the light with holden s distinct melodious riffs the pace gathers with the dub club mix of belong by old timers spooky and then charlie may supplies the grand finale with his remix of mandalay s deep love ending the mix with a peak time delight full of subtle uplifting vocals and killer synths the cd is fantastically mixed with twists and turns and an unrivalled flow it s a return to the happier side of progressive a return to the state this genre was a few years back healthy vibrant and joyous this mix is going to receive comparisons with the classic northern exposure series but you cannot deny that music has changed since the mid to late 90 s and as such it is quite difficult to make a comparison one thing is still the same though and that is there is some fantastic music being made this mix a proof of this producers like pole folder cp flash and charlie may who represent each corner of the earth are definite proof to this is without doubt the best mixed release in the last year or two digweed has yet again proven no other dj comes close to showing what progressive house truly means
i have to confess that i was skeptical when i saw dubfires name on the remix of s but wound up pleasantly surprised as the track unfolded paced by exotic bubbling percussion bird noises chimes some nifty effects and a stripped-down hi-hat and snare rush the track expands exponentially swirling into a spaced-out tasty brew indeed giant tympani washes things clean and things start to build again this time bringing a giant snare roll that explodes midway through the track literally detonated by the rollicking steel drum that careens through the midpoint of the mix constantly shifting and changing up the rhythmic patterns without relying on the crutch of a predictable bass kick dubfires remix is a tough one to mix out of even at 13 minutes i stand corrected the moles reworking of on the other hand is exactly what i was expecting: a fat bouncing bass bubble a big handclap and some punctual grunting/chanting the tweaked analog synth riffs that meander through the track seem a bit out of place with the chicago-style rhythms of the intro at first but once it warms up it provides a solid texture for the track the moles mix lacks the drama and big-room potential of dubfires more ambitious version but both versions do the originals justice and should find welcome ears even if they are unlikely bedfellows fans may prefer the moles take but i advise them not to make the same mistake i did in prejudging dubfires

stripping things back and dusting off reliable gear has led to monster hits this year: just take a listen to the new wax 20002 almost anything levon vincent has put this name to or the host of releases on the always impressive ostgut ton jay ahern one-half of techno duo hauntologists obviously takes inspiration from the aforementioned and his new foray into production under the guise of reveals an artist that transforms his influences into something new title track and is a stunning production geared for the darkest of warehouses and the biggest of dance floors simple repetitions of the punchy synth lines layered over the chugging percussion let time and space melt away and the creepily soothing vocals by uta alder punctuate the hypnotic vibe of the eleven minute track easily one to play from start to finish its a complete monster in all the right places but doesnt rely on flashy production to get the job done flipside burner picks up where the a-side left off with plucked synths marrying nicely to staccato toms until the composition lets loose and reveals itself to be a jacking techno masterpiece lastly brings closure to the simple yet effective trio its a largely loop-based track that shows hints of what ahern brings to the hauntologists production style and underscores the feeling here that comparatively laid-back production is currently just as relevant as its more ostentatious competition in the world of techno

included as an exclusive on his new dj-kicks comp l o v e isnt going to disappoint any mcde fans and thats all many will need to know l o v e is smoother than what you might find on his raw cuts series but it has the same kind of expert sample mining that makes you feel like youve just discovered an old vinyl in the back room of the record shop its no exercise in chin stroking though: every sample is carefully tuned to groove the bassline feels nostalgic moonlit and beautiful the passionate female cry ( without a love maybe ) is primed to soften the most workday-hardened heart asement love on the flip is less propulsive and more skewed dwelling more in a seedy world of shadows and velvet drapes

earlier in the year la producer helped launch an interdimensional transmissions sublabel with his ep packed a potent pair of expansive sharp-edged techno cuts not to mention a rather twisted ambient piece and for s second record those tracks are skillfully reworked by three intriguing artists from the us underground the a-side features 4/4 remixes of broken-beat cut courtesy of silent (aka juan mendez) and downwards-affiliated chicago duo talker (aka karl meier and jon krohn) mendezs tunneling take layers some of the original thrashing and splashing atop his own oblique riffs and distorted droning atmospheres talkers succinct version is fairly straight-ahead especially compared to the duos more experimental work but its no less intense with bits of the cascading original melody surrounded by sandblasted industrial textures and gales of spectral tones after those two bangers boss bmg takes to his modular and veers toward spacey dance floors with a slower version trippy and acidic it growls twists shudders and pings for almost eight minutes is another solid step forward for ; given the talent on hand anything less wouldve been a surprise
this intriguing unpredictable package of remixes of french alt-folker don ni os is overwhelmed somewhat one reworking that comes under the event banner that accolade goes to chlo who twists the quirky slow-burning campfire mood of the original into an echo-drenched dub freakout an elastic bassline pings and pops the length of the track which is peppered with off-kilter handclaps and bursts of scouring metallic noise long-time air cohort and franco krautrocker turzi doesnt veer too far from the original save for some frantic heavily-distorted galloping guitar heavenly synth flute and an eerie ice cream van chime finally mexican producer cubenx takes things back to the (traditional) dance floor with a take that adopts trancey stylings growling distorted bass synths a twinkle-toed keyboard line and lashes them to mid-paced live percussion

lee burridge sander kleinenberg have been two pretty top class djs in the last few years spreading their gospel individually pretty much everywhere around the world this time the two djs combine for the this is everybody on tour album and the result are two pretty upbeat mixes that gives a taste of the madness these two djs are capable of for me it is the first disc mixed by lee burridge that is the stronger of the two it begins brilliantly with the tasty sacha funke mix of ada s livedriver and then smoothly blends into the intricate tribal beats and bouncy basslines of easy ride by tresca the disc takes a pretty crisp and techy course early on with tracks by riton vs howdi dinky must all keeping the flow running in a smooth and intricate fashion the gritty basslines and strong drums of dum dum then kick the mix into another notch of life while db and tim paris combine to deliver a twisted yet funky and melodic moment with future now dirk technic puts you in a trance with the brilliant i love you while the sounds of esplanade 97 take you back to retro town the dude by afrilounge is another superb moment as the disc heads to its conclusion provided by the very funky and seductive 2 bullets by michicoan it rounds off a superb disc that sums up the very addictive sounds that lee is capable of sander s disc on the whole is a little grittier then lee s despite the downbeat start to the album provided by pony chris lake ups the pace early with some subtle melodies and dirty basslines in until she rises and the intensity doesn t let up with lower eastside getting dirty in swordfight bodyrox provide some nice work with the peak time sounds of yeah yeah while west london deep add yet another quality production to their repertoire with dark matter bounce back mr roboto lift the pace of the disc even further not necessarily in a great way as the productions aren t that inspiring serge santiago gets the train back on the track with a tasty piece of music in atto damore while robert babicz closes things off superbly with the very brilliant melodic and driving synth stabs of look it closes off a disc that is quite hit and miss in periods as occasionally poor tracks disrupt credibility of the mix if you are looking for a pretty good package that gets straight to the point then this may be the answer due to the fact that lee and sander only have a disc to work their magic they don t leave any petrol in the tank as they deliver some pretty solid peak time moments resulting in an album that is quite energetic compared to other recent releases
makes all kinds of techno for all kinds of labels though its usually aggressive most recently hes been going down a circuitous idm-informed path which led him to the more experimental strokes of his debut album for bloc earlier this year but where longanimity appeared last year seems most fitting for his dense and scatterbrained dance music is the latest entry in the berlin labels gridlock series (meant to highlight the freaky and the functional ) and its among the finer records in the discography the title track makes the broken beat attack of 2015s mormon shuffle seem two-dimensional in comparison here farr lets his intricate interlocking drum patterns slam together like a game of tetris running at triple speed while huge synth leads screech in between its a wild ride though max gives farr a run for his money with a remix that stands as the package highlight the producers are a logical pairing: both use coiled digital textures and wrap them around big melodies for his remix of goes straight for the jugular sending out jackhammer melodies so brutally repetitive that you might think the record is skipping when the music peaks the flipside has a lot to live up to and while it is more conventional its full of farrs usual attention to detail all terse chords and lunging drums plays out like a typical techno banger but its corrupted by the same serrated digital noise as rides bold basslines that recall go figure max in a bad mood early tracks made him out to be a producer looking for the biggest loudest thrills but steps toward the deeper and weirder without sacrificing any of his chaotic charm
john barera and will martins debut is a neat bridge between the chicago labels bright airy house music and the pairs high-spec dance floor material ( ) re-treads the effortless machine funk they crafted so well on their past records most notably their debut album graceless title tracks basic elements sound simple enough but theyre weaved together with a keen ear for detail cascading dewdrop melodies of ( ) capture most of the attention but the bassy kicks and jangly cowbells do the heavy lifting high rides on a piano loop and a polished arsenal of 909 percussion which thumps its way around a solid if unspectacular track with its needling bass and dfa-style cowbells is the star of the show title is apt because the songs essential parts feel as if theyre being tossed and twisted in and out of shape for the songs duration viscous melodies that swirl around wind down the ep

constantly looking to expand his horizons sebastien devaud is now giving a go at a motion picture soundtrack following his seminal addition to the now extinct at the controls series late last year and in lieu of a proper original studio album he scored a film about people driving at over 250km/hour for distances in excess of 2500 km in need of a groove (or if youd like lola for the furious generation ) that said the soundtrack works just as well as a stand-along long player while being efficient at the dosing of both techno and house moments (intertwined im afraid with the inescapable inconsequential skits characteristically spoiling the genre) flirting with the most lunatic fringes of the house world album opener with its operatic vocals and spooky atmospheres is both evocatively cinematographic and functional even though it would probably sound more at home in a film noir it is the most blatantly peculiar thing on here yet if you recall the gloomy mulholland me -like vibe on s dj mixes its also the least surprising on the other hand current single is more upfront even though it explores s thic house vein with aplomb while and wouldnt sound out of place on a get physical-sponsored full body workout compilation (the latter heavily relying on chord progressions reminiscent of mandarine girl ) being first and foremost a techno dj also has to increase the tempo on two cuts recalling the overarching theme of the movie: first on which has a laurent garnier-like relentlessness blended with marc romboy at his most euphoric then on a marching drum-inspired beat-driven cut with very few late-in-the-game melodic elements next to these the bluesy the and the trip-hop vibe of feel strangely out of place but while might showcase music from and inspired by the motion picture any long-time fan will find plenty of inspiring moments from this peripheral release

four years since nathan fake introduced the world to my old cornish buddy - via his myspace page the low-key producer turns in his second ep for swedish imprint released in 2011 -pylons debut hammerfest displayed a healthy cross-section styles moving from choppy melodic techno through to manic electronica and ambient is cut from the same cloth albeit with a more incisive edge with constant tweaks and twists the title tracks sprawling twelve-minute body bears the markings of music recorded live ducking the eqs at irregular intervals including a ninety-second sub-aquatic interlude midway through - brings the piece to life flitting between an assertive lead synth and celestial pads (which oddly recall the chord progression from daft punks one more time ) the track draws to a close with a sense of cosmic grandeur by comparison is more subdued nevertheless as a bed of rugged kicks and hard-hitting claps support a tapestry of twinkling melodies and spiralling synths it evokes the same feelings of ethereality
its kind of astounding that has never put out a solo record before the berlin-based producer and sound engineer has had a long and illustrious career: he was a member of the influential 90s duo sun electric made experimental techno with tobias freund as nsi played in the moritz von oswald trio and remixed the hallowed ecm catalogue with ricardo villalobos (he also played in a late 80s ebm group called fishermans friend but thats neither here nor there ) all things considered loderbauer is one of the most distinguished electronic artists in berlin but until now weve never actually heard him on his own this made it a bit of a surprise when his debut solo album quietly appeared on this summer has many of the hallmarks of loderbauers collaborative work sound design is the main attraction but theres plenty of room for warmth and emotion not as much as a track title like might suggest but more than usual for a record this avant-garde (its a walk in the park compared to rashad beckers album ) there are undulating rhythms in and but not the kind you can tap your foot to and 2 both have powerful chord changes and is a kind of volcanic jumble of arpeggios but the album always stops short of being melodic all of the tracks have the same drab romance as the image on the sleeve a photograph taken by loderbauer himself taken as a whole is like a gallery of abstract images each with a different mood and shape some evoke a sense of cosmic wonder echoing the ambient side of krautrock (tangerine dream in particular comes to mind) others are exercises in rhythm and sound design that end up feeling otherworldly listening to its obvious why this guy gets on so well with villalobos throughout the record theres a level of clarity and ultra-refined minimalism that calls to mind ecm whose credo the most beautiful sound next to silence feels relevant here loderbauer may not have the same star power as some of his peers but as reminds us hes truly a master of his craft
*back catalog review* the 11th release on sees the label travel down another alternate course this time unleashing the smooth house sounds of with included are 3 solid deep and smooth house cuts that are sure to impress those with a groovy flavour on the a-side is ( of flavor version) the track slowly builds with some quirky drums and hats as well as some horn stabs that drum roll into the introduction of a very smooth baseline and smooth effects smooth is the operative word here as this track has an abundance of it with delicate drums combining sweetly with a dubby baseline for the most part quality firstly on the b-side is (late-night dub) which is heavily influenced by the original but mostly seems to omit the build of the a-side and gets straight into the guts of the production a good reason why it is indeed a few minutes shorter then the a-side following this on the b-side is love is which for me is the highlight of the three tracks the drums are a little more intense from the word go and the baseline is to die for smooth and very groovy this is sure to do some major damage on a good sound system it is a very good alteration on the original mixes and definitely gets a thumbs up from me another strong release for the ever impressive and this release in particular is definitely going to appeal to the house heads that like a little smooth and funky
there are a few things that stand out about s past life as the leftfield hip-hopper mc illreme one is the playfulness of his music the other is its confrontational quality as demonstrated by a video from a 2008 in-store in which kamoda crouches on the shop counter leading a call-and-reponse over hyperactive surf rock before launching into an unexpected crowdsurf (you can see lawrence le doux his bandmate in baleine 3000 watching quizzically from the side ) he brought these qualities with him when he recently migrated to dance music his birth-name tracks are weirdo disco house full of chunky grooves and exuberant samples but theres a riotous energy to them which you dont always associate with the style and sometimes this spills over in unexpected ways most memorably on last years the clay a riotous percussion bonanza that was hammered by the likes of pearson sound kamoda has yet to reconquer that peak but he comes close on his second record for is the track in question a hard-as-nails drum track punctuated by wailing saxophones its compressed as fuck slamming ride cymbals and diva wails into your eardrums in the brief break moments where the full drum kit hammers out 16th notes its almost too much bear which is exactly whats good about it the rest of the record tries for less effective extremes (((bye))) is a low-slung hypnotic looper while is a deep house headtrip opening with fried psych guitar before settling into a louche groove both steadily layer their samples building to sticky climaxes that detract from their dance floor impact kamoda does best when he lunges headfirst
fter a period of relative quiet ricardo villalobos seems to be everywhere lately nd as per his wont hes turning up in all sorts of unexpected places weve recently had his ndf remix for df and his bootleg-not-bootleg of tobias s street knowledge ; lphahouse has also reissued a 1999 collaboration with dandy jack as ric y martin nd now he brings his lysergic touch to krautrock maestros moebius and neumeier for japans label quick backstory: in 1983 clusters dieter moebius guru gurus manfred neumeier and kraftwerk producer conny plank collaborated on zero set an album of squawky skronky oscillations and powerful funk drumming that still sounds ahead of its time (the closest contemporary equivalent might be attles ) in 2007 moebius and neumeier recorded zero set ii in tribute to plank who passed away in 1987 villalobos rework as well as a pair of mixes from prins released on a second 12-inch draw upon the material from these sessions unfortunately its hard to compare the remixes to the original release: zero set remains in print but the sequel seems unavailable at least outside japan villalobos contribution is a 33-minute remix thats been divided in two and spread across two sides of vinyl in a way thats fitting because this is surely going to be a divisive remix for fans of his more hypnotic work the extended percussive jam will probably hit the spot or at least provide a soundtrack for spelunking in k-holes as rippling ride cymbals and skillet-spatter beats flutter against the kind of digitalist improv you might expect from an editions mego release listeners requiring more insistent beats arresting riffs or discernible structure may well dismiss it as self-indulgent noodling the second part is weightier than the first but neither is going to satisfy many peak-time urges no matter which camp you fall in its hard not to be annoyed by the incessant one two three thats replayed over and over which faintly recalls ill murrays role in groundhogs day had his character been a bandleader instead of a weatherman like villalobos prins stays in character with both his versions spoiler alert: theyre pretty kraut-rocky with ropy basslines copious tom fills and cymbal splash and a live played-not-programmed feel the five-minute version is the more restrained of the two with a demure acid burble tangled up with bluesy guitar riffs and lots of resonant filter gleam; the ten-minute version on the -side digs in for the long haul with extended synth soloing and a heavier crisper drum groove does it jam hell yeah oth villalobos and have turned out fitting tributes to moebius neumeier and plank without whom both producers would undoubtedly be very different musicians stylistically though neither is likely to blow you away riskier but more fitting homage would have put the chilean and the norwegian in the same room and let the tape roll come what may
from the ravey thump of his remixes of lex coulton and smoke and the snarling breaks-splattered hackney parrot a track still shocking dance floors a year since first airing on boiler room youd think k ed russell had spent the 90s throwing gun fingers in smoke-filled warehouses he was actually two years old when goldies seminal terminator exploded on a nascent jungle scene and his punishing take on sounds only slightly younger than him is a way of puncturing a collective nostalgia for rave culture russells music is rave recalled in horrific flashbacks where the signifiers of early 90s jungle twist into uncanny shapes in isolation no element of nancys sounds novel its stitched together from jungles infinitely sampled breaks sinuous basses and euphoric piano stabs russell approaches them with little respect for their history or connotations; by mutating hackneyed sounds like the think break that stalwart of everything from hip-hop to hardcore which disintegrates on the opener into a grinding drum sequence he presents something recognisable then makes it seem suddenly foreign its a disorienting technique on euphoric chords counterpoint equally relentless percussion but soon their effervescence starts to flicker like an unreliable memory eventually they collapse entirely only to reappear slightly tweaked on here they judder beneath kicks so booming that each hit makes the entire track recoil

is s debut on given his youth its reasonable to assume that the label played a large part in his conversion to industrial techno he certainly shares a grim distinctly british sensibility with the likes of perc (both must have been tickled pink by the eps eye-catching artwork which comes courtesy of tattoo artist liam sparkes ) s music is low on melody dramatic structuring or any great surprises sometimes like on the serviceably dank opener the relentless linear churn borders on dreary but its the producers textural control that redeems him in these times of industrial techno bounty its easy to simply crank up the saturation and hope for the best; s grizzled sonics feel more imaginative on shrieks are shredded and crumbled like wet newspaper until by the midpoint only a few soggy scraps remain s decaying percussion is harried by an eardrum-tickling midrange buzz and strikes a particularly fine balance between distorted mulch and bare muscle s tracks are nothing if not functional but that last one is particularly banging
sure theres straight-up innovation and artistry at work at as evidenced by recent releases from nicholas jaar and seth troxler but what to make of jamie and cohort lee foss releasing yetanothermgmtremix maybe credit goes to the brooklyn duo for unleashing a virulent strain of psychepop that appears immune to time now over a year after the release of as a single is the obvious club-banger with a funk bass line laying the foundation for echoed ooh girl repetitions that take their time building into most of the chorus over the length of near eight minutes of dj-friendly fun for the extra smile a touch of bongos keep it light but not to worry trademarked wonkiness appears past the halfway point to keep it all delightfully crooked foss is a subtler affair removing some of the bass but keeping the bongos and working in more of the original melody and vocals albeit chopped and echoed into oblivion near minute-long vocal and handclap break eventually deconstructs the song to its core with the balance bouncing from left-to-right and providing a great exercise in abstract danceability the third track meanwhile shows the duo can also keep it cool with musement a disco boogie edit of an early 80s r b obscurity turned into an early evening or morning feel good tonic perhaps to soothe a frayed dance floor soul after hours of subversive techno
with the recent official announcement from panasonic that they are no longer going to make technics in conjunction with the boom in digital djing formats the call has been made far and wide that vinyl has seen its last day however with labels like pom pom laid and wax still holding on theres obviously life left in wax following on in that vein is who have hand-stamped their first release and individually numbered every single one of its 200 copies nothing else is known about the label artist(s) or who pressed them up only designated as side the first track is an upbeat number with a recurring clap that serves as the steadying metronome throughout halfway through an echoing haunt rings out making it clear this more than just a tool its staggered nature proves whoever is behind this thing has quite a bit of experience in the studio side is longer deeper and more fulfilling it is constructed for use either building toward a climax or for a twisted late night/early morning affair it twists turns dives ducks and resurfaces with an i vocal sample used to keep it consistently chugging throughout its eleven minutes
long island electrical systems latest half-release (as their white labels are denoted) comes from save his real name (nik dawson) a few compilation appearances on a small ay rea hip-hop label and that greasy pizza stamp on the back of the 12-inch i refuse to believe isnt riddled with meaning i cant find much on him ut his sound and boy does he cram a lot of it onto l i e s 009 5 speaks nay screams for itself makes for a pitch-perfect example of the sort of uncompromising music l i e s mastermind ron morelli spoke of recently in his little white earbuds interview : while it certainly sounds of the moment it basically knees dance music convention in the groin pleasantly clunky shouldnt be nearly as danceable as it is ut by the sheer will of its insistent rhodes chords and cavernous congas the track renders chinscratching next to impossible frican is more coherently clubby on the surface throwing dancers in a pit of syncopated drums and incoherent siren song that kick we long for though never arrives and by the tracks end were suspended amongst the clouds unsure of how to get back to earth or if were even interested in going there

the 2nd disc of the careless kind by comes with two new remixes from breaks favourites evil 9 and a relatively unknown name of naum gabo despite the host of remixes he has completed for the likes of franz ferdinand the evil 9 remix is first up and i must say it is a hot remix expect the usual gritty sound that evil 9 is known for and it applies here in particularly as the track flows nicely with gritty guitar riffs and the main vocal line the track builds delightfully and subtle gains in intensity throughout ending in a peak time flurry of baselines and great drum patterns the naum gabo mix is definitely the most unique mix of the lot relying on some broken beats and quirky drum patterns and electro effects the vocal gets a good run in this mix as it flows over the bouncy electro baselines and stuttering percussion a very solid remix here that adds to the fantastic evil 9 mix and makes this disc the go to disc for this release
of all the precocious talents to grace the roster is perhaps the most overlooked and underrated with only a handful of remixes and a single ep to his nom de plume florian peter is admittedly less than prolific but his debut falls was nonetheless a bypassed masterpiece its b-side suite communquis and reprise was like a toccata and fugue for house music whose symphonic scope of exposition and development more than justifies the hyperbolic tone here from the concert hall to the chamber his follow-up is a pointedly reductionist affair the title of the a-sides track is an honest appraisal: its built around a simple but sweet interplay of sequences and becomes a synthesised lullaby thanks to elegant vocals that belie the fierce alias and mien of singer accessible and unobjectionable its a traditional a-side inasmuch as it acts as a safety net for the b-sides more artistic tightrope peter hardly needs it is as much about what it lacks as what it has there are gaping holes in the arrangement the sparse percussion the laggard bass and lonely choral suspensions all grow as the elements try to impose themselves on this musical vacuum but for every promising crescendo theres a sudden drop back into the abyss its bewitchingly unsettling is altogether less anxious but no less enchanting the plucked and legato strings the piano theme and variations the surprise entry of the guitar it feels as though were being told a story ala peter and the wolf with the current mode for brandishing arbitrarily-coined terms would it be so unreasonable to think fondly of this ep as fairytale house
giants here loads of em quick rundown: is a collaboration of with guy called gerald is steve hillage an experimental legend whos been around since the late 60s along with his partner and fellow gong ex-bandmate miquette giraudy mochi is less-known but well respected his warm heavy techno having been put out on mote-evolver and cocoon amongst others carl is carl ll very well but this would mean exactly squat if the music wasnt any good but oh hang on its fanflippingtastic carl s remix is on the side so lets start there: its a track which broods dormant for most of it keeping you engaged with some ancillary lines and flourishes breaking out only sometimes when it does though its powerful and glorious he also knows having been a collaborator on the project in the 90s and he respects the accessibility of the original while lending it a more serious edge with some well-placed out-of-tune descending sounds the original from the recent up album is a club track too but with a somewhat sunnier disposition and a fruitier beat its unsubtle blissfulness is hardly fashionable but i could see it being pretty transcendental at the right place and time (beach festivals sunsets etc ) mochis is a whirring techno workout that spends most of its time chugging along functionally taking a short break in the middle for some starry-twilight shimmering pads and delayed late-floydian guitars
the latest 12-inch from s projects a particularly insular vibe all four tracks feel like the work of a musician who spends his days locked inside an attic feverishly documenting his diy investigations into hardware electronics its an image that might not be far from the truth actually juggling several projects and a pair of excellent cassette labels (lmgrovllum and grovl) the always-busy philip maier qualifies as a hardcore experimenter of sound considering maier is yet another talented export from the carrboro north carolina underground (see also profligate lazy magnet and secret boyfriend) it should come as little surprise that sits at the intersection of techno and noise but what truly distinguishes this music is just how haunted it is by proto-industrial primitivism namely mid-70s cabaret voltaire and early pyrolator and are harsh diagrammatic studies in rhythmic rot built from grubby synth chords clubfooted kicks and what sounds like the dying pulses of archaic heart monitors eight minutes of choked reverb and rusty percussion thats steadfast in its denial of momentum is just as austere however behind all that thick analog crud is a musician whos deceptively fussy about sound design after all it takes a lot of hard work to make music this perfectly decayed
sasu is best known for his techno and idm-inspired productions as vladislav delay but over a career of more than 20 years hes covered a lot more ground than most hes produced experimental pop as sistol and vocal house as luomo as well as performing live jazz drums in the vladislav delay quartet last year collaborated with mark fell on the footwork-inflected sensate focus (1 6666666) a new direction he explores on his self-titled debut as for his new label of the same name the music here might be his most chaotic yet a mutation of footwork spliced with techno the two tracks on are apparently the outcome of studio jams and they certainly sound spontaneous though off-kilter kicks makes it feel as though the track is charging forward in a frenzied the tempo of 39 is closer to techno than footwork it gets even more intense in the second half as the beats threaten to slip off the grid 24 is much faster with garbled r samples and an onslaught of percussion it doesnt head towards a climax or breakdown but sustains a wild-eyed peak for its duration
the sweeping deep house of dresdens came to prominence 18 months ago with a fine ep for his home citys uncanny valley ramp offshoot where iconoclastic house artist gerry read has been making his name feels like another good fit for the german the two productions here show a nous for slick drum programming ( is an old-school hip-hop head) and emotion both going about their business in an unhurried fashion allowing plenty of time for their subtleties to filter through is lovely piece of detroit-flavoured house fed by a crunchy half-pace tempo and a rat-a-tat woodblock overlays this with a hint of organ drone and clouds of orchestral synths picks up the pace slightly jerking around to a spasmodic rhythm made up of reversed beats tablas and live toms call it breakbeat house but slowed to a languid pulse like the a-side it has a gentle considered approach thats easy to like
its m on the dance floor and your friend is shouting something near your ear that you cant quite make out you smile nod agreeably and try to zone out to the music the room is dark and smoky a little claustrophobic you start to think about calling it a night when a two note bassline emanates from the stacks followed by the most peaceful chords you can imagine t that moment everything suddenly slips into place your friend stops talking and locks into a head down shuffle the tunes transportive power lifts you above your fatigue reminding you why you came here in the first place the track is s if theres new music powerful enough to inspire the kind of breathless nostalgic tone typically reserved youtube comments on 90s rave videos its s side of his split 12 inch for the house oriented imprint of finnish experimental stronghold s hk recordings true to the obtuse nature of everyone involved both sides of this record are mixes of tracks that have never been released s finds him in a restrained deep house mode that he hasnt tried since the first two sued releases the track is melancholy and meditative a take on the spiritual new york sound plied by producers like fred p naturally s version is somewhat ramshackle snare that sounds like a scraping metal brush drops four minutes in and the slight variations on the chords that form the tracks backbone make it clear they were played live with room for happy accidents s contribution is terrific but its overshadowed by s showstopper begins with a blast of noise like an old modem before it introduces a vocal sample from madteos 2013 track we doubt (you can make it) which came bundled with a remix on last years excellent drippin for tripp (tripp dubb worked with a raft of collaborators; hes in solo mode here but somehow feels like a curated piece maybe its because of the core elements it shares with thousands of other records abstruse experimentalism a wonky but insistent bassline vintage rave pads arranges it all for a perfect immediately familiar 13 minutes like an amazing forgotten track given a euphoric late night airing
michigan s continues a run of excellent releases this month with the lead single from s forthcoming longplayer the track was previewed last year as a secret track on ghostly international s idol tryouts two compilation but now it is revealed in all of its eclectic glory simultaneously bringing to mind miami s glitzy techno variants the more straight ahead minimal of spectral s main stable and in a way even the south american flavored funk of mash up king diplo the result is a festive mix of piano chords tropical percussion and a stuttered vocal sample that will be equally suited to late night summertime dance parties or daytime raves the vinyl version comes with an exclusive luke remix featuring his signature acid tinged synth freak outs warped vocals flute swells and huge beats that completely mutates the original track into an undulating techno beast it s a surefire summer hit on the flip s collaboration with fellow spectral artist james t cotton turns in the excellent cotton s filtered synths and clipped beats are the perfect foil for s decidedly cleaner productions and the track delivers it s a wonderful storm of freaked keys and pitch bent cymbals underpinned by warm pads and a driving electro rhythm perfect for pleasing an already warmed up crowd cop this while it s hot and get that summer dance party started up right
when we last heard a major statement from jake fairley in 2008 he was crafting lush electronica under the influence of classic trance and early kompakt his new ep for his first solo release there is a reminder of how much the predominant sound of the underground has shifted in the past two years theres something almost unfashionable about this ep which forgoes deep house pretense in favor of tense acidic sequences and metallic fm synthesizers nearly nine minutes long is threaded by a single midrange bass pattern that knocks like the tapping in poes the tell-tale heart might have had poe taken to cocaine instead of opium ll the action is in the lines that wind around the filtered throb: flashing hi-hats glassy pings and a melody like a hive of bees ubbling and roiling its not entirely unlike the so-called headfuck techno of giorgio gigli donato dozzy et al but the messy manic intensity here sets s interpretation apart plays a similar set of sounds but it makes something completely different out of them with a gently swinging beat that eases off the 16th notes it sinks into a relaxed groove; bell tones and muted pads are further softened by sweetly cycling harmonies that never resolve instead he threads major through minor stacking countermelodies to build to a beatific eyes-closed climax its a whole different approach to deep: hardly au courant maybe but full-fathom just the same
in the last few years there has been a proliferation in the amount of people producing really good techno acid minimal and everything in between the majority of these producers are new but (aka rob acid) is an example of an older producer that has managed to stay relevant by reinventing his sound (to some extent) many of his new tracks have that trademark acid sound but what we are listening to is most definitely acid for the 21st century this man is not stuck in the 1990s him and his machinedrum are moving with the times the last year or two have seen a series of quality releases for babicz on labels like punkt treibstoff and k2 making him a producer to keep an eye on unfortunately however babicz s latest release on audiomatique does not live up to some of his other recent outings the title track is a jam that seems much better suited to his rob acid guise driving the track is a distinctly average acid riff which never really develops sufficiently to get the listener excited the acid is garnished by some rather misplaced vocal samples effects and a pointless melody that chimes in now and again seems to suffer from not getting the time love and care it deserved rock again confirms the suspicion that babicz didnt spend long enough behind the mixing desk while a considerable improvement on the title track this track also seems underdeveloped it has some good elements the constant rumbling bass is rather nice and the accompanying distorted loop gives it potential the problem is that the track never really goes anywhere it feels more like the first draft rather than the final thing the b side a remix of from robag wruhme does not add the value to this release one might have hoped it is a solid affair and while intriguing doesn t really grab you the main problem is that robag has been too faithful to the original choosing to stick with the acid and vocals and with such source material he was always going to have trouble coming up with a really good mix the track does have a number of familiar wighnomy trademarks but the charm of the brothers remix machine has started to fade and it is not enough to save babicz this release is somewhat disappointing considering what we know babicz and robag are capable of hopefully this is an aberration rather than a sign of things to come
travis stewart aka has been prolific over the past decade his work steadily evolving in short you rarely know what youre going to get hes gone from the hip-hop tinged house of his first release want to 1 to the lip-smacking pop stylings of alarma never sitting stylistically still with his most recent effort stewart once again has evolved by trading in the vocal samples and bouncy footwork-tinged rhythms of its predecessor sxlnd for a somber complexity the title track palpitates with a breakcore pace and monstrous build that begins brutally but is then tightly wound until its forced release into a veil of torpid synths its that brutality that really sets this ep apart from the rest of his work a grittier grimier side of comes through in with its brittle crackle and eerie vocal sample the track is certainly more of a headphone oeuvre than dance floor banger that incongruity is what makes his work so interesting at one point is melting faces on a dance floor somewhere and then it transforms and proceeds to lullaby you to another realm
before minus before the cube before richieeeeeeee there was music richie hawtin was known in the electronic music community as one of the driving forces behind the plus 8 imprint but it was his work as that changed the course of his career in the early 90s hawtin was pushing the bpm breaking point of techno along with daniel bell and john acquaviva as cybersonik but a trip to rotterdam in 1992 opened their eyes to the brutalist (and racist) ways in which such unrelenting music could be taken after the visit overseas they came back to the states with the knowledge that going harder was a creative cul-de-sac the answer for hawtin at least was a project that he described to me earlier this year as a good combination between dance mentalism and heady mentalism you can hear it from the off on this career-spanning document taken from 1993s sheet one is 11 minutes of 120 bpm brooding acid despite the frenetic drum patterns that fall between each kick is surprisingly slow as well as his recent live shows under the moniker have proven the music made under that name was never meant to engender hedonism is more about delirium the concept has changed over time sheet one was a reaction to what had come before 1994s musik was an extension of that taken from the sickness single was released just before minus was born and is just as powerful of a minimal mission statement as consumed and reminds us why has enjoyed being richieeeeee in its wake (given the opportunity who wouldnt want nay need to escape the sort of demented mindset required to create closer ) whats perhaps most fascinating about though is how coherent it all sounds listen to and back-to-back and you can hear the throughline most longtime fans of have constructed their own greatest hits package in an itunes playlist but offers an insight into what hawtin himself deems important to present it leans slightly heavier on older material perhaps to educate even for longtime students though theres something to learn or remember the one thing that i take away is that there are reasons why people like richie hawtin reach the heights that they do when you strip away everything else surrounding him this music is reason enough

iron curtis a producer whose records could rarely be described as average has a fondness for classic house sounds shot-through with his own sense of weirdness daniel is probably one of the strongest acid-leaning tracks of the last 12 months while last years horses was nearly as excellent and eccentric to boot so its odd that his latest collaboration with leaves with whom hes previously worked on some innovative productions is a straight-laced house cut thats not to say a bad record fter a deliciously awkward start which sees the bassline tripping over itself to keep up with the frenetic pace of the hats it finds its stride with the addition of some extra low-end thump gelling the track together more completely its undoubtedly a well-executed track but is probably straddling a few too many fences its a little too shiny for the deep house boffins and a little too understated for the bassline crew youandewan has established himself as a go-to remixer for deep house labels both large and small and its not hard to see why here evoking hazy memories of us dance floors past his remix roughens up the smooth edges and layers the scuzzy beats with shimmering wandering chords its more direct and extremely confident
though s move towards 4/4 might still be controversial to some dubstep devotees by now hes proven himself an honest enthusiast of techno and house the problem with oliver jones output since that shift is that it feels novice bland and by-the-numbers the sound of someone trying to imitate a craft they might not fully grasp (hes also been roundly criticized for using untouched sample packs to make his tunes ) coming on ahead of a new album is an important release in s career the new platform might establish him as a legitimate member of the house and techno community once and for all though leaves his biggest problem unresolved sounds like trying to figure out what makes a festival banger tick he aims for the sweet spot between euphoric and melancholic but clumsily overshoots leaving the track with an overwrought melody and synths that feel too cheap to really get the message across redshapes remix attempts to salvage giving it a tougher techno chassis and bolstering it with some melodramatic drum hits of course you cant make a new sports car out of rusty junkyard parts and so even in the seasoned german producers hands sounds anemic as a dj might fit comfortably in the house and techno realm these days but by the sounds of he still has a way to go on the production front
the original mixes of s lonely child were met pretty well late last year with 3 good mixes making a solid release for the saw imprint this time satoshi tomiie gets in on the act with two remixes alongside the original downtempo mix the satoshi tomiie 3d remix is a very solid piece of work building with some tough basslines alongside the main vocal line and some crisp and chunky drums midway in the track takes a bit of a melodic turn introducing some smooth strings and pads which then meet well with the vocals giving the track a smooth and uplifting summer feel the satoshi tomiie 3d dub takes a lot of the great touches of the vocal mix such as the smooth aura created by the basslines and melodic aspects and creates a vocal less dub mix that will definitely please those put off by the main vocal
s last record was an elegant outing our father was bewitching eerie and tuneful with just the right amount of warehouse oomph bubbling beneath the surface the track seemed made for dance floor meditation with church organs complementing that quasi-religious feeling im always fascinated by the parallels between communal worship and the club experience james shaw has said but i cant narrow it down to something more specific his latest ep picks up the theme again albeit more ambiguously is more theatrical than magical but its no less graceful than our father shaws attention to detail is his most powerful asset here like the pin-drop notes placed with precision above an ocean of bass and gaseous atmospherics is more militant with a paranoid loop that demands your attention from the beginning n elongated three-note melody brings a sombre tone to the track as stinging electrically charged waves wash over the top
holly waxwing is the production alias of garrett crosby a birmingham alabama producer who helps run the increasingly interesting noumenal loom imprint and while he may be another male producer regrettably taking on a female name the music is good enough to (almost) look past that his first tape for the label 2013s goldleaf acrobatics showed a developing sound somewhere between ryan hemsworth and pc music: cute and brightly coloured and marked with an emotional streak that made it almost grandiose on he sharpens his approach and ramps up the cuteness just like his recent mixes the record looks beyond genres like trance and eurodance for inspiration take which marries clicks cuts-style minimalism with the kind of clammy synth basslines youd find on mid-80s kate bush records its vaguely housey though its so fragmented that the focus is on the details rather than the rhythm puts crosbys scalpel to work on vocal samples cutting phrases into microscopic pieces the relentless cheeriness is undercut by vaguely trappy hi-hats that lurk beneath comes the closest to pc music aesthetics with its chipmunk vocals and pitchbent synth sounds while sounds like a childrens tv show theme even these two are detailed and complex tracks that pack plenty into a mere few minutes part experimental club record part sound design showcase and part style exercise has a lot to appreciate

dont kid yourself s still creating the lush mental atmospherics of their past; they just dont frame them in progressive trance anymore the swedish duo manages the melodic blissouts within a sound template thats gone mouse-in-the-night in comparison to their past now preferring to distill intoxicating often ethnic shards of melody into dense percussive workouts their new single is no exception theyve borrowed from the tribal thicket of their cocoon single jamaica but theyve amped up the humidity creating a focused cult anthem of a sort thats almost appallingly simple in construction for how much disorientation it generates wrapped around an unrelenting drum blitz gets stinky and swank before its supposed to the tracks title comes from the desert-sky bazaar sample that gives its twinkling tones something to shimmer against in fact is a fantastic melding of title and tone as its wild-eyed melody warbles in and out of its lattice-like rhythms like a stream of water let loose in cluttered halls -side has more in common with the ambient second disc of the duos full-length from earlier this year nimals terse electro slap guides fresh dawn synths and bird sounds out of the cuts contemplative mode each-stroll tones steady what little action invokes here creating a placid breezy space thats almost alearic in effect in fact via its stark contrast with the sweaty hump-back gains of almost equals its emphatic counterpart in how well it reflects the duos mastery of mood ut the heat comes first here and is one of the most immediately immersive singles in the duos recent catalogue as good a test for how much bend and torque you have left in your spine as ive heard this year
is another one of those veteran dj s called upon by fabric to add another diverse mix to the consistently brilliant fabriclive series starting his trade in the mid 80 s laying down smooth funk soul and acid cuts this modern showcase of s talents present a different story with 70 minutes of fine drum and bass being the catch of the day an early highlight in the mix is the funked up beats and delicate vocals of share the blame by j majik feat kathy brown blended in nicely after this is the electro styles of total science s squash while the twisted screeches continue with j majik again this time its tell me doing the damage the mix contains a good steady flow maintained by the latin stylings of danny c s the mexican the smooth vocals and samba beats of bebel gilberto s so nice livens the mix up it s the way of vocals with what u don t know by a sides as the mix comes to a close a job done by another solid production by danny c with ace face not a bad introspective into s current drum and bass sound the mix maintains a uptempo pace throughout and enough diversity in the mix to maintain some interest from the screechy electro drones to the party like drums this mix is sure to please the drum and bass loyal another fabric another quality mix
club music is serious business please do not occasionally smile while dancing order colourful cocktails or flirt with members of opposite sex it is not acceptable to be goofy unfortunately some people have not gotten this message nd refore it is my duty to tell you all not to go anywhere near music known as or track known as hyperactive percussion that asks you to bounce your buttocks around like two rubber balls in a very small box is not serious business it is not serious business to rap about london buses yes i know its got this catchy grime-lite bassline and that you get caught up in listening to all numbers being shouted out and that whole thing has a terribly infectious energy ut you must be strong and resist somewhere re s a man making music about computer viruses using only analogue gear that s been buried in a hole in detroit for last five years please continue to listen to that instead as shock of a new genre or people having fun is absolutely last thing we need in electronic music right now remember this is serious business
there are some albums which are ripe for remixing and s mine is one of them in the absence of s vocals the berlin-based producers full-length debut always offers a solid hook or fat bassline in short: recognisable elements which can be effectively reshaped for other uses unsurprisingly the most successful track from the lp comes first with staffan handed remix rights though hes kept the bass bompty s version isnt so peak time the vocals have been chopped up pitched down and scattered to complement the originals stabbier elements which are now an oft-repeated hook lones remix of focusses on additions rather than true reformation its still a touch analogue but now an arp brash cowbells and heady exhalations lift the sunny original right up into the clouds returning to s approach the re-work of pairs deep vocals with a stomping and slightly fuzzy kick the originals silken melancholic melody is introduced in the last quarter but here its disjointed and not quite as purposeful

comes at us out of cologne on an anniversary press for as they reach 50 in their catalog both the city and artist are known for their diverse approach to music and is no exception water damage begins with a twisted intro of offset synth hits until the 1-minute mark when the first break arrives reverbed finger snaps enter in the background with a filtered rave style bass line escalating into a peak at 3 minutes some xylophone and spacey patterns mix together softly creating a subtle space amongst the existing heavy sounds this groove continues until a distant vox is brought in finally riding out with the xylophone and spacey pattern taking over until the end (7/10) mildews has an attractive vocal snippet used in the intro and dropped out at 1 minute before a lush pad starts to push through a complimenting stab is introduced with a flute type melody filtered in on top of the long bass line the 3-minute mark sees the arrival of a break which increases the power of the track while still giving the track room to introduce more sounds another sound comes in at five minutes in tandem with a flute like stab which adds to the atmosphere within the track deep oooh so deep with quite some punch this is excellent for building early in a set (8/10)

this is the first release on a label and 12 inch series from mike greene aka and ali tillett of party/booking agency warm true to the labels cordial name each installment of the series will be bringing together friends old and new in a spirit of collaboration and togetherness the sounds on are just as friendly which is unsurprising given the involvement of confirmed disco smoothie greene but they dont succumb to over politeness greene begins his side with the london producers track has plenty of his usual bubble bath texture but is given an edge from a low hanging bassline and whippy drums its counterpart has a glimmering almost jazzy feel with strings and percussion confidently pushing it forward panorama bar resident h ppners contributions both take cues from uk garage the pick of the pair s vocal flecks and clicky drums pop addictively against fireside warm bass notes a similarly urgent and comforting quality inhabits helping make for a package that uses its diversity well
ukraines aleksandr voznichenko aka io or makes picture-perfect tech house tools hes spent the last few years developing a formula built around complex basslines snippets of melody and shuffling percussion the kind loved by djs as diverse as prins thomas zip and maya jane coles its music meant for djs which means that voznichenkos work remains relatively unknown for those who do follow him his releases are buy-on-sight like peers such as cab drivers john dimas and varhat hes the kind of producer who can quickly and easily shift 1 000 copies of a new vinyl release voznichenkos obsession with this loopy sunshine-friendly sound is a blessing and a curse on the one hand his tunes are dance floor sure-shots if you play house music you arent going to find many records more versatile than his its also relatively one-dimensional which means that if you own one of voznichenkos 12-inches buying another wont give you much you dont already have releasing the letters and numbers double-pack a snapshot of modern tech house on music is a bold move its six dj tools all built with jazzy snippets of melody and buoyant basslines dont seem suited to an extended format but the trio behind music dan ghenacia dyed soundorom shonky are veteran djs which probably explains the subtle variety the label was able to get from voznichenko variety is relative though and many who skim through letters and numbers will consider the tracks very similar but for many djs this package will be one of s most worthwhile purchases theres a tune for almost any situation warming up throw on or both warm contemplative rollers with heavy low-end and trippy barely-there vocals is more upbeat thanks to a dynamic melodic bassline dubby synth stab and 16th-note hi-hats is more driving and is letters and numbers most obvious peak-time cut again hi-hats and claps zing above a catchy bassline but this time the low-end is more straightforward and gives the dance floor something simple to latch on to voznichenkos sound is a far cry from the synthetic tech house long dominated by labels like minus highgrade and desolat when the wider dance music community starts taking notice of records like letters and numbers tech house might shake off its dirty connotations which would only be a good thing
s first solo outing on liebe detail simultaneously explores both the dark and light sides of house music excelling in both directions on the dark is represented by the twisted bass and menacing male vocal while flashes of light come courtesy of a few touchingly simple piano chords that lighten the mood considerably the process is flipped on ; a gently rolling bassline and soulful vocal utterances are pinned down by mechanical growls and a harsh snaking synth that spits acidic venom over anything that comes within range a powerful analogue bassline dominates soulphictions reimagining of and although theres a nicely cut-up piano sample that serves as a momentary distraction the low-end is hard to ignore and where the attention happily remains ron caresses a little more subtlety his remix of the same track teasingly his typically retro-sounding synths over firm drums with spacey continually evolving results the joyful organ that seeps into the mix mid-break perfectly serves as the delicious creamy topping on what is an extremely strong ep
will sauls move to rolling somerset countryside means hes closer to ristol a city whose music has increasingly informed uss direction of late keiren lomax an ppleblim cohort and ristol denizen first appeared on label with a couple of remixes four years ago he marks his full debut with two bass-leaning house cuts but as befits a producer who cut his teeth on drum bass its not typical fare in case of the that means marrying a steady kick and reedy synths to a rubbery bassline and filling spaces in between with intricate textural flourishes its languid bounce gives it an old-school electro feel rides in on shimmering arps before it flowers into an intriguing mix of wobbly uk garage bass finger clicks and subtle bursts of nu disco-style synths
like many of his label peers is not one to be bound by genres he cut his teeth in drum bass as exile on labels like moving shadow and eta recordings before moving on to more experimental junglist outings on planet mu and flirting with breakcore gabber and cabaret in a live environment on the descriptively named s nuisance gabbaret lounge on these experiments are boiled into single tracks that mutate and skip through genres tempos and styles but still remain interesting and coherent starts of in glitchy hip-hop territory skipping reverse drum beats give way to rising chord progressions over which exile sings about his journeys through the family galaxy an ever-changing environment of uncertainty that nonetheless sounds welcoming the tracks structure adheres to the principles of the family galaxy which exile outlines thusly keep changing every day dont stay the same or youll be a fool s the track goes on the tempo is slowly turned up from lazy glitch-hop stylings to a techno-sounding four to the floor beat only to explode into frenzied breakbeat territory dont m is a wholly different type of journey ts set off by looming but beautiful synths which eventually crash into abrasive techno territory around the three-minute mark raspy metallic sounding riffs then roll along with the clunky beat while exile repeatedly tells us that he doesnt know where hes going and that he doesnt care s a listener one gives in to exiles views and goes on his musical trip without knowing where it might lead you even if that means paranoia-inducing techno funk or the mechanic drone of exiles time-stretching and twisting his own voice

what are they trying to say and how sincere is their message these questions have often cropped up in responses to ondon based label and collective plenty of music makes its way out into the world without ever having such questions asked of it but from the start s members have made sound just a part of their toolkit presentation and persona have been wielded as readily as chords and melodies inline with the art school idea that pop isnt just a musical style but a vessel for coded postures statements and ideas but theres another side to too one not concerned with concept or provocation but simply devoted the craft of making pop songs you could maybe call it the collectives music school side given s composition degree from goldsmiths university and founder a g s tendency to make goofy jokes about maverick composer conlon nancarrow or to sneak renaissance choral polyphony into his songs (the breakdown of if youre wondering) this approach revels in the sonic excesses of pop and obsesses over the techniques used to achieve them has cited scritti polittis cupid and psyche 85 as one of his favourite albums and that groups scrupulously glossy songs are an obvious reference point the crowd talk about forever s and eternal s; scritti polittis green gartside looked for an absolute both bring an element of critique with them on their journey into the eye of the pop storm but mostly theyre there to have fun feels like the work of technicians and devotees rather than saboteurs there is often surprising complexity beneath the cutesy delivery of its girl next door singers as in s which presents romance as a dizzying loop: i like the way you know that i like how you look and you like me too i know you do musically tracks can read like vivid technical studies: s for instance gets interesting as its shiny synth chords begin to layer and arpeggiate a careful exercise in prolonged gratification which is billed as the labels first official release and contains nine of its best tracks to date can be roughly split in two and belong to its more conventional side in which a spectrum of genres from the last two decades are cobbled together into songs with verses choruses and (often pretty addictive) hooks for all their strange angles and squeaky sonorities these songs satisfy in the way that pop has always satisfied no more and no less and s aplander are cheap thrills but profoundly gratifying ones their chart dance templates turbo charged with playful detail ( s maudlin isnt quite as good and s has the kitschiness but lacks the giddy yearning) the compilations other side is strikingly different and ipgloss create a brilliant mess of half melted voices and disjointed drums as if theyve rummaged under the hood of a pop song and ripped out a few random components these tracks are ugly and illogical but just as compelling as the others perhaps theyre best thought of as yin and yang two complimentary sides to an approach thats fascinated with the nuts and bolts of musical style and whose fascination is infectious beyond the music can be a frustrating entity theres little to enjoy in their clunky attempts at corporate critique and cringe inducing video work but shows the collective from another more favourable angle
incorporating supposed footwork influences is fast becoming one of the bigger trends in uk dance music whether its intentional or simply invented by eager journalists desperate to construct a narrative regardless theres something happening with more more uk producers djs mixing footwork into their sets garage producer has gone so far as to call his latest ep its tracks should ostensibly carry some trace of the rogue chicago dance scene while im going to go out on a limb say footwork elements arent as well represented as mr thinks they are there are certain footwork tics characteristics buried in his nu garage not always smoothly track itself is your typical uk garage revival track: dulled kicks swelling synths strings vocal snippets ut here the vocals are more hyperactive than usual cut up in the same repetitive barrage as in footwork itself effect is simply unpleasant when the wordless moans are s wiched between the folds of s much slower more structured beats (on the result is even more aggravating) flurries of ticking toms feel merely ornamental its only when the tune breaks out into an instrumental passage at its close that it sounds at all complete drum machine domination of on the other h is merely decent; it sounds like s typical work with superficial stylistic additions ep is salvaged by its st out the a collaboration with fellow young uk producer the two producers capably work off of each others strengths track struts with s funky influenced style the rolling bass left over from his dubstep days replete with a gracefully processed triumphant vocal phrase canned orchestral flourishes the is a keeper but im not so sure about the rest
is a techno night and label based in cork ireland its run by jamie behan a veteran of the scene and one half of alongside stephen mahoney both have been djing since the mid-90s but is a relatively new hardware-based project that sounds like a mashup of techno acid electro and chicago house is s debut ep a collection of unhinged machine bangers fans of tinfoils and on the hoofs weirdness will likely appreciate modulated noise drills through the centre of getting more rancorous as the track steams on is less abrasive but boisterous and more energetic like a mound of mexican jumping beans complete with cartoonish xylophone notes that give it a cheeky twist the cheekiness continues on which teems with homemade sounds between the kicks giving you plenty to home in on even if the track doesnt make you want to dance the hypnotic is more likely to get you moving with its slender 90s trance hook its the most functional track on the record but who needs functionality when you can be ricocheting off the walls with s oddball jive
if a rose is a rose is a rose then what is a in the case the anonymous producer behind four releases on its easy to guess that its an homage to marcel duchamps alias s lavy the reference is certainly in keeping with s tumblr a kind mood board the historical avant-gardes whatever the case his her their signature materials (classic-sounding synthesizers and drum machines) and form (dusky straight-ahead techno) are readily apparent throughout oth tracks on the ep are hair-raising affairs: the corkscrewing shepherds is soaked in resonant squelch and its headlong tumble recalls psychedelic trance circa 1994 ( tom heart and tetsu inoues head dance for example) boasts a lankier more relaxed groove at least in the beginning emphasizing skipping house-centric upbeats but the midrange is a maelstrom metallic synths and silky filters and the overall effect follows from the austerity pansonic plastikman and sleeparchive the rtificial ep is slower darker and more narcotic; instead an expressway to your skull its a series stealthy wormholes trepanning your dome in multiple points theres no parsing the various elements the three mercurial tracks; just an endless spiral lfos fluttering in the shadows muted beats and handclaps dissolving into fields drone sometimes there are beats and sometimes just pulse; no matter what shape it assumes this is techno at its headiest
once upon a time it would have seemed improbable to find daniel snaith remixing a record it has only been in the last year or so that snaith has committed himself to producing club-tailored electronic music (by employing an alias of his own daphni); much of what came before has been tempered somewhat by his extensive output as caribou and manitoba guises indebted to a broad collection of rock prog and psychedelia influences though snaith has never been a stranger to the euphoric sensibilities of dance music (of which niobe from his 2007 album ndorra is a fine example; the striking odessa from his last caribou longplayer swim is another) much of his catalogue is a world away from this pair of remixes tightly coiled baseline and a stuttering vocal are prominent features of the first remix here which also retains the spirit (if wisely not the range) of the beatless analogue original on the other side the cwejman dub imports the clangers whistle (something along the lines of scratcha dv s natty ) from the first remix and smudges the bassline into an insistent loop-within-a-loop chug whatever the differences between the two it would be remiss of us not to mention the kick on both: youd be forgiven for applying an onanistic expletive on first listen that snaith has taken a rather taciturn set of squelches from this record and assembled a neck-ripper to rival ye ye might have seemed like an especially absurd irony a while ago but such is his reputation in 2012 that releases of this quality are no longer a surprise

have been dodging the math rock bullet for some time now y ve signed to an electronic label (warp) released an album that defies classification ( mirrored ) and introduced it with a single that can only be described as an alien glam shanty ( las ) now that we have finally caught up with the band they lose us by standing stock still - and releasing the quintessential math rock track elements of are pure rock - bluesy riffs harmonic solos rolling rhythm section - but it would take a team of nasa scientists to explain how they fit together my own gcse-level conclusion is that it has something to do with the band s chemistry: their loose improvisations are held together with tight-knit playing and possibly telepathy result is the kind of barmy intricate epic kyuss could ve made if they hadn t spent their high school years doing bongs takes a suitably scientific approach to his remix which puts under the microscope a split-second s worth of samples is spliced treated beyond recognition and fused into distorted hypnotic techno that would wrong up the trippiest holden set instead of going anywhere the sound closes in around you until it becomes unbearably claustrophobic when the last minute opens out into ringing melodic wide-open space it begs the question: if had more up his sleeve why didn t he use it four is much more faithful to the original opting for a pimping up rather than a complete overhaul he starts with an engine change replacing the low end with humming synths and a driving kick before rebuilding so that it makes sense to the dancefloor (and human minds) loony vocals that throw out with their intro are held back until the halfway point before the live drums drop electronic battle weapon 8 style and the track meanders back towards the band s version other material on this cd/dvd set is the very definition of filler: a remix that does little more than slap rent-a-thug rapping onto the original live tracks that fail to capture an experience that has to be seen to be believed and promo videos that are easily googled fans are advised to download the four remix and the curious should save their cash for a copy of mirrored : you won t be disappointed
s paul rose the dj moves from room to room and from night to day in an old power station in erlin so too does paul rose the producer is a 125 pm deep house track with a bassline funkily unaware of its composers usual domain its a marked shift in approach though not without its emblems: the vocals chopped up garage-style give a signature to roses house tenure which is as deft and welcome a turn as joy orbisons ladywell to flip the record is to take a trip downstairs to a more diligent crowd and sound s more familiar turf of techno so much has been written about roses relationship with erlin and erghain in particular that the place seems almost a crutch to his work hed rightly argue that hes been as pivotal in shaping its current soundscape as vice-versa but its surely with that funktion one system in mind that he envelopes now in such a full-blown industrial pad its stitched together with hi-hats so prickly nothing but crystal-clear amplification will do for them either less swung more serious on the whole theres still a foot in the bass that keeps the door upstairs slightly ajar
p c b are up again on the italian based mantra imprint with another interesting two tracker that keeps the label coming back to them for more freakin burnin builds interestingly with some nice percussive elements and some looped vocal stabs shortly before a smooth and subtle bassline moves the track forward in a great direction the track has a nice subtle and eerie feel to it shown in the breakdown and again towards the end when a melodic riff runs through the track alongside the dark and moody beats this is a great production from p c b ok radio begins with a driving bassline and from the first beat it is clear that this isn t as subtle as the a-side it drives with some nice percussion in particular and some twisted vocal hooks and melodies not once really letting up the intensity thanks mostly to the groovy evil low end sounds a very solid release here from p c b with two productions that are both superb in their own right
take one addictive bassline a stodgy dollop of synth a smattering of sensual female vox and youve got yourself a dance floor delight that seems to be the recipe for newcomer and her two tracker on get physicals wee sister kindisch anyway having contributed her vocal charms to einmaleins and blu fin releases last year kindisch sees the stockholm native drop into the producer seat as headliner swoops around a three stab bass arrangement built with crisp snare drums simple hi-hats and rounded off in the latter stages with a throbbing automated synth is simple in its ingredients yet extremely effective in its job of jacking the club floor on the flip rides a similar sound palette of bass-led phenomena yet packs a little more punch bubble popping percussion couple with an acidic synth melody and warm vocal taunts injecting a type of movement very different from the show stealing bassline style of the a-side
oops for the lost proved to be far weightier than i expected when hearing it work on the dance floor ut i can safely say that there is no for the lost on what you do have though are the guilty pleasures apparently k sophie trudeau and danuel tate you can hear both rather easily on : trudeaus violin playing is sweeping falling sweetly in line with the moles light-stepping raw beat while tate the keyboardist for cobblestone jazz does his thing with the mole popping in to masterfully cut him up to sound as though hes playing live you can tell why people have been asking about this track for ages its harder to hear trudeau if shes there at all on the -side but tates organ playing is the main focus aside from the rolling beat hes cut up this time to pieces only present in single notes and short three note phrases the track is similar in some ways to for the lost although its plenty less epic (i e youre never caught waiting for a bassline that gives your life meaning when it appears) ut the easy-going vibe suits the mole just fine as its relaxed nature should provide plenty of help for djs looking to warm things up
is a collaboration between gareth kirby and former mindset artist stickman why they chose to name the project after a former ritish home secretary is a mystery although im hoping it turns out that johnson spent his youth running a system at jamaican soundclashes because thats where this ep draws its influences from its refreshing to hear dubstep in that has more than a passing relationship with dub oth tracks are built on a sticky low-end with snatches of patois bruised by bone-shaking percussion has a touch of early skream about it as though someone took his cid people smashed it with a hammer and then glued the pieces back together gabba bass thuds through halfstep beats the drums sounding more like scrunched-up paper than a snare with the echoing cry of bludclart tipping a hat to dubs forebears where s rhythms are fractured follows a more straightforward path although it also features murky subs and drums with timbales that crack hollowly as the bass purrs like a contented lion it wouldnt have sounded out of place on plastic peoples floor seven years ago but feels like its referential rather than a throwback
first appeared on the steady rising parisian label last year with the shadowy group contextualizing their deep dark productions with thrilling sci-fi storytelling ir output since those two eps has included an appearance on an excellent dscrd remix ep but listeners may still be wondering what will come next for the research assistant and the polar children chronicled on last years eps for now well have to be content with these three top-drawer remixes of their work is the projects most aggressive production and it would be a tall task for a remixer to push it any harder wisely silent smooths over some of the sharper edges with his version replacing the originals main motif a hair-raising shriek with stuttered bellows and indiscernible feedback-laced vocals its probably the records best peak-time track francois s remix of on the other hand feels like a perfect set-opener co-founder uses a spoken-word section to launch into a cut of rough angular techno that doesnt let up until the very end abdulla s take on is more difficult to classify it could be the soundtrack to a frantic chase through a windswept forest leaves rustling and unseen creatures cooing as you scurry past though youll have to be careful not to trip over the cleverly placed drops along the way its another wily effort from the swedish producer and it finishes a record that confirms s status as one of todays most intriguing techno imprints
is the brussels-based duo of pierre de muelenaere co-curator of the bozar music and arts festival and seasoned producer and idiosyncratics label founder yannick franck they first teamed up in 2013 and have since released a few cassette and vinyl eps each homing in on a industrial and ebm-tinged style of techno is their second record for the busy uk label desire and it might be their strongest release to date the ten-minute sounds like an improvised jam one that might be too messy for all but the most intrepid djs it builds into a droning blur with surging drums echoed incomprehensible vocals and all sorts of sharp edges the records two b-side cuts are even more compelling conjures its own mass of screeching cackling distortion but adds an icy sense of melody through a few sustained synth riffs and fixes everything to a rolling kick is the most subdued thing yet from but its no less potent its steady bass thrums and light hazy swirls of harmonized noise make for a supremely soothing comedown
hot natureds benediction broke the top 40 in the uk jones felt the need to defend himself s second single from peaked at number two but guy and howard lawrence arent on the defensive far from it in fact the uk duo have embraced pop music and who can blame them they wear it just fine fter last years wildly successful the ace ep the two have the dance world under their thumbs and they look set to do the same with the mainstream is their plan of attack like basement jaxx before them have found the elusive common ground between pop and club music and the result is this seemingly effortless summer album s latest moves have seemed like outright grabs at the charts songs like and are shiny dance tunes that sound like they were made with radio 1 in mind they write their songs with a pressure-cooker formula that makes every drop enormous (they like their pre-chorus breakdowns) many dance artists struggle to incorporate vocalists but crucially know how to write a tune many of them are just silly love songs but they exude a genuine youthful energy yells i tried to resist but you caught me over the duos storm of synths it feels perfectly convincing s mastery of their form isnt limited to the sugar rush highlighting their garage impulses for one of the records most irresistible moments has a leisurely lope to match s measured tones nd they can still make a fine instrumental like s cracking opener playing with a sample that sounds like a feverish preacher the drums hit crisply and the song vibes off its own tireless energy elsewhere chops up a diva sample and her is a dizzy sequence of ascending and descending scales isnt perfect of course those instrumental moments dont feel as revelatory when theyre next to the poppier numbers especially since have a knack for finding vocalists with charisma and putting them to good work the only singer who isnt a complete knockout is who sounds like a cartoon devil on otherwise guest spots are their strong point an aspect that often trips up other artists predictably have seen quite a backlash from the dance community or some their sound is too retro reaching back to the apex of early 00s commercial uk garage or others their choice to privilege vocal gems over club tracks is simply unforgivable a clear indication that their mind is on the charts but where their allegiances lie is irrelevant and though their brand of dance music is indeed a squeaky clean one doesnt feel like its trying to be an underground dance music record its the complete opposite: a pop album brimming with imagination vibrant melodies and yes a fair bit of formula but all pop has to have formula and lucky for them s happens to be a great one
even more cynical detractors cant deny that ed bangers imperial phase that stretch time during which labels very ethos was encapsulated by distilled through a series fully formed federative releases was impressive from me from vicarious bliss in 005 to d d s u v in 0 0 (without even mentioning justices first rounds distinctive cuts) parisian stable had a firm hold on mid-00s so-called french electro trend but se days you can really sense pedro winters desire to exp his br fer a more varied palette mickey moonlight for instance who gave ed banger its first trip into cosmic territory earlier this year lso in this vein is thibaut berl k ed bangers latest recruit on his first long-player after a few low-key singles remixes stays as far as possible from sebasti ns sonic lacerations; he opts instead for f wall nods second-rate attempts at digitalized funk la discovery -era daft punk justin timberlakes modern-day soul it all makes for an amusing diversion for sure but not necessarily a substantial one se aes tics are perfectly exemplified by songs like which are exactly what timberlake would record if he brought his michael jackson impersonations back to life for halloween yet those inclinations work better on instrumental cuts like programme as y both channel 970s s t porn soundtracks carefree sha-la-las elsewhere like on lifeless or way its hard to know what albums numerous guests (ruckazoid pacific ) contributed to sound which comes across in end as a collage chromeo lionel ritchie princes eponymous album circa 979 in that regard bromance crew (brodinski club cheval gesaffelsteinare) are building a more convincing attempt at taking first-wave french electro heritage pushing it into uncharted territories with ed banger seem more more lost in a tumblr-tinged display self-referencing: very now but just not very new

so its all back to towers which on this evidence is a crazy place to live this is a cd that varies wildly from track to track so if youre expecting great musical coherence then think again thats not a big criticism though for messrs hyde and smith have chosen some great tracks that make for a vibrant collection never dull on the slow side of things theres some peerless r b from dangelo in brown sugar and tlc in creep surely two of the best slow jams of the 1990s also gregory isaacs (public eye) and an overlengthy introduction in the form of gil scott herons b movie the closest thing to s brand of faster techno comes in the form of rave signals exhilharating charge horse power whilst by far the best djing moment of the disc comes when toots the maytals 54-46 blends in to ltj bukems music an inspired moment dave gahan finds himself drum and bassed on barrel of a gun which mixes into the aphex twins peerless didgeridoo from all this youll gather that s record collection must be the envy of many what would be really interesting now would be to hear a techno based compilation from them as they clearly relish the art of compiling records
the second mix of satoshi tomiie s electronic soul series -b takes you on a velvety journey back in time swinging through disco electro and old school house flavors the mix kicks off with some breezy vocals and then disco fever with a 70s bass-booming groove on metro area s proton candy tomiie s own recording glow with fun atari sounds connects the first two tracks nicely and sets the foundation for the mix with pure mellow deep house which steadies on through the next few tracks the sounds get retro again with dan berkson s concept a fun escapade into the early 80s before a typical john tejada track enters making you feel like you re floating in a giant bubble the mix reaches its peak with the next pair of tunes closer to me with its suave vocals stretching female droning and stirring synths getting you rousing again the beats get quicker and the house gets purer with kerri chandler s bar a thym before tomiie concludes the mix with some more neo-disco fun in spirit catcher s code breaker -b has a much lighter feel than its forerunner a tight progressive mix with its twilight vocals and vintage mellow bite it is a perfect soundtrack to lounging nights or daytime wash ups on beaches cafes

you me s 2012 debut album for dresdens was a swirling often serrated and always challenging take on deep house that succeeded through exper entation rather than falling back on the genres usual tropes this wonderful ep the first of two by korn that the label will release in the coming months picks up where that record left off both in terms of its varied musical atmosphere and in its precipitously high quality its joyous guitar sample cavorting over claps elasticated drums and fluttering vocal fragments makes for a euphoric opener the early moments of are spent in the gently propulsive company of ping-pong drums and cowbells before unexpected warning-siren rave chords kick things into high gear you me consisted entirely of collaborations and on korn goes down this route again with guesting on bass guitar his languorous work lends the track a jazz/disco feel thats complemented by glinting pads and a soulful vocal the tropical-sounding synth chords of meanwhile echo the jaunty feel of punchy percussion acidic bass and gorgeous pads complete a swelling rumbling treat of a closer

most of the artwork for minimal waves sub-label for contemporary music is dark and erotic if not a little morbid especially for veronica vasicka a records visual element is important vintage handcuffs cut up polaroids of 90s clubgoers kinky photos from the archives of silent servant these twisted but romantic images speak to the labels dark mix of techno new wave and industrial but on s latest the label debut from theres a different kind of gateway visual: a simple but striking color photograph of the artist herself davidson is a montreal-based synth artist poet producer and most importantly one-woman show on stage she has a table full of machinery but whats really enticing is what she does with her microphone davidson is a storyteller and even if her spoken lyrics are abstract half in french and half in english its easy to picture the scenes she paints n the last few years this vulnerable style has defined albums like perte d dentit and un tre voyage which explore moody soundscapes and upbeat sequences taking the latter approach further is a confident entrance into club-centered tempos and grooves davidson told fader that the album inspired by her european tour as half of the dfa duo essaie pas stems from a fascination for dance music and club culture as much as a disgust from it is not a collection of dj tracks but a ride through one womans style of engaging live performance throughout tough machine sounds are layered in ways that give the whole thing a seductive rough-cut groove re are no standard techno knocks of course davidsons voice is also present and the tracks where she takes center stage are among the most memorable is a manic synth jam graced with decrees of pride and defiance na ve and spell out sensual stories of the heart with playfully domineering beats on carlate and plan te the mood turns dark showing just how intensely cinematic davidson can be album also has distinct moments of pure machine jams nterfaces with its bouncy thwacks and stumbling motion is a flirtatious groover full complex rhythms is denser and trippier with bright hyperspeed synths that shoot out from a hypnotic core on nferno things take another dramatic dive into darkness with drums ricocheting in a constricting atmosphere at the end of it all is the title track which after such wild moods and stark machinery comes as a shock is a smooth and wistful synth pop song that shows davidson for the first time actually singing and its beautiful n the background soft crowd chatter can be heard like a theatrical cue that the shows over you can imagine the velvet curtains drawing to a close ts a charming end to an album that puts this artists very personal craft in the spotlight from the lyrics right through to the cover art
since 2010 lars sandbergs has served mainly as a platform for his own work a notable exception being chymeras dreamrunner maintains the status quo of the imprint with both sides relying heavily on melodic motifs in tumbling notes carry themselves ever forward their optimistic rotations backed by a misty pad diminuitive percussion ensures that the focus remains on these two elements sandberg sculpting the former with filters and decay quiet rave horn blast (or something like it) emphasises the end of each phrase nicely in the scuttling refrain is a little weaker progressing like a rollercoaster it climbs dramatically upwards several times scaling cacophonous heights before dropping right back to silence the slight middle eastern flavour is interesting but ultimately the hands-in-the-air posturing make it seem less artful than the other side
following on from their hugely successful collaboration with meat katie overneath aquasky continue their high powered assault on the breaks scene with girls boys a collaboration with el hornet one third of drumnbass production powerhouse pendulum those who are very familiar with the sounds of aquasky and pendulum can just forget everything they know as they take bassline breaks into a housey electro territory and have roped in the talents of dylan rhymes and high contrast to produce a remix each side a original mix opening up with a very dreamy intro featuring sweet and calm tones - lulling the listening into a false sense of sleep which doesnt last long as they drop into a big bassline solo during the buildup aquasky el hornet introduce the catchy female vocal and it feels like a very cheesy take on who da funks shiny disco balls from 2002 (it rhymes with it as a matter of fact ) seems like aquasky are taking to their new sound very well as they drop a highly infectious rhythm crossing over to electro house territory surprisingly still sitting at a very comfy 135 bpms with a subtle emphasis on percussive grooves that can be heard in the background whilst they chop up the female vocal phrase into various incarnations of the original after seeing the mayhem caused by this tune on the dancefloor its safe to say that aquasky and el hornet have created one of the tunes of side aa dylan rhymes remix tech-funk player and sugar dj dylan rhymes takes a turn in providing a progressive and percussive version of the tune and making it a lot more dj friendly as he drops the massive bassline on top of a break without a breakdown as well as the big bassline dylan incorporates his own take on chopping up the vocal phrase and gives the tune a bigger electro feel as he lays down some squelchy electro goodness on top of the bassline
stalwarts of the brazilian drumnbass scene marky xrs have finally delivered their debut album - an album of finely tuned drumnbass tracks with a notable latin flavour to them hailing from sao paulo brazil the pair have been regularly flown back and forth to the uk to play at clubs like movement where djs the likes of bryan gee have been caning their tracks and signing their releases to labels like v recordings marky xrs run their own label in brazil to release their own product to the south american masses and it is on innerground that spawns from showcases the duos fascination for all things drumnbass and have even teamed up with notable collaborators to rework previous releases the albums opens up on a sublime laidback tip with tunes like highlights - chilled out moods atmospheric synth lines funky bass licks and tight drumnbass beats without too much emphasis on ripping up the dancefloor i know builds the vibe with harder snares and female vocal hooks while continuing on highlights chilled vibe terapia gives off a dub vibe with its dubby drums echoey piano loops marky xrs appeared to have created an album in the vibe of a mix cd - starting off on a laidback tip then moving into harder dancefloor oriented tracks not bad but if you wanted people to listen to your album wouldnt you want to start it off with a corker of a tune to grab peoples attention and then mix in the rest of the tracks in later for me starts with rotation which is aimed at the dancefloor - percussive drumnbass beats with a nice uplifting vibe cleverly placed breakdowns and drum fills but still isnt the heaviest weapon in marky xrs arsenal tijuana frogs changes tempo down to deep jazzy house fat electronic bass lines jazzy synths classic old skool samples and what sounds like an electronic flute fluttering make up one deep house track suitable for summer days and warm sunsets its been almost 2 years since the pair had unleashed lk on an unsuspecting drumnbass audience with the song being selected to open up markys brazilian job cd from 2002 lk features spanish guitar and a vocal sample of jorge ben with stamina mc completing the mix with his combination of sung vocals and mc lyrics - we like it i like it youd like it too moments of lust appeared in instrumental form on bryan gees sound of movement cd which was released last year this time around theyve teamed up with vikter duplaix to provide his soulful vocals for the guitar led rhythm fellow drumnbass producer m i s t provides some input to sunshine (touch me) featuring the vocals of un-cuts jenna g the three producers give the track a nice uplifting feel using lots of percussion long synths while jenna gives the tune a little r b flavour legendary drumnbass mc/vocalist cleveland watkiss lends his vocals to the latin flavoured breeze which is similar in approach to moments of lust - funky vibes and soulful vocals from one of the scenes best as a finale (to the cd release) brazils minister for culture gilberto gil sings on dia de sol its good to see government officials taking part in dance music culture and gilberto has been in the music biz since the late 60s dia de sol is one prime example of latin flavoured marky xrs style drumnbass only to be latinised even more by the vocals of gil finally vinyl buyers get the exclusive vinyl only backspin which i suppose would call for a lot of them as it is a peaktime percussive slammer aimed directly for steamy dancefloors after a weak introduction with the first three tracks offers drumnbass fans a selection of uplifting tunes with that marky xrs latin flavour laced throughout not all tracks here are really intended for the dancefloor with some perfect for quiet times lounging around at home for those expecting an album full of lk style dancefloor slamming tracks its best to forego this and go for markys brazilian job - bug your local store to get more copies
it was hard not to be excited upon hearing that would release her first album in four years on a label like both are prone to throwing fantastic curveballs might have made a name for herself with chart-smashing r b on majors like virgin but her hits were always backed by pretty strange beats and theyve proven to have a much longer shelf-life than most remember millionaire that shit was a jam even david guetta producing on her most recent album 2010s flesh tone couldnt burst the bubble given all this is at first pass a mild disappointment many people were probably hoping it would sound like something that actually belongs on instead its a collection of soulful rhythm and blues ably produced by dave zitek of tv on radio judged on these grounds it does have its strong moments if you heard a single off the album that first surfaced about a year ago youll know what to expect: massive horn riffs rolling basslines some epic strings and who is as powerful a vocalist as shes ever been lead single is another highlight driven mostly by piano chords with a huge brass break for the chorus its ostensibly a feel-good anthem but the lyrics point towards a torturous relationship with an ex is maybe the funkiest track here with a smoky staccato rhythm guitar that goes perfectly with s husky voice but while this all might be new for its nothing we havent heard before is a decent r b album built on live instrumentation something thats been done and done and done again you would think that with zitek at the controls some risks would be taken but theres nothing challenging here even within itself its pretty samey and the tracks that do sound different are actually the blandest like the winsome folk noodling of might sound pretty but its weaker than the sum of its parts
debut release on lee gambles label comes from latvian martins rokis whose work under his birth name moves in the art world more than music spheres gamble of course straddles that line himself and rokis oblique club tracks can sound about as noxious and alien as the p n artists own familiar sounds often appear in unstable configurations like the frantic snare tattoos and bass groans of which couldve made for a footwork-ish banger were they not so sickly and unsteady on their feet leans on a firmer house groove but its decayed sonics and sinister mood make the 4/4 beat feel claustrophobic rather than liberating elsewhere rokis mixdowns get ever denser and gaseous its a striking sound though in places the wobbly beats might have been better served by clarity on both the title track and glitch effects are sculpted into churning loop pieces on the latter they grow ever more swirling and confused until the whole thing fizzles out from exhaustion
what do we know about the pixelated press pics that make him look like hes been caught on cctv with his fingers in the till the jeremy kyle mask he donned for his oiler room set and an irreverent attitude to house music in interviews could be seen as an attempt to create an anti-personality ut if he keeps making music thats this compelling why should we give a monkeys feels precision-targeted to an open-air terrace smoky throbbing organ ambles by in tandem with a deftly employed bassline thats sonorous and sparse theres the merest of looped vocals a bit of vinyl crackle and sparkling hi-hats simplicity is its key read takes a more leftfield approach on you can hear some of the trademarks of 90s french house that were his first contact with dance music the jabbering vocal loop frantic eq jerking bass read drizzles some mild acid on top along with an intense interlude of stuttering percussion and some wonderfully rich analogue keys
has sherard ngram aka ever been more popular last year the artist moved from detroit to berlin to better accommodate his regular gigs in europe or as he recently told crack to be near where the love was music ngram makes and plays whats known as electro though he prefers the term techno has come into vogue thanks to several converging factors a disparate array of s ( helena hauff objekt binh onur zer) have slowly introduced the style previously the preserve of acts like aux 88 dm krew and e r p to fresh audiences labels that incorporate electro ( cabaret recordings time passages) or embody it ( central processing unit shipwrec ) have helped do the same but ngram hasnt necessarily been swept in the tide of circumstance his catalogue as a solo artist and collaborator hes one quarter of urban tribe and one half of alongside gerald donald is extensive and estimable as a hes long been recognised as one of the most thrilling youre likely to see his sets capture tense dystopian moods via needling arps synthetic squalls and scattered drum patterns mixed with surgical speed and intensity this style is rendered on kern vol 4 with a disorienting twist the 44 minute mark where hour long mixes tend to accelerate ngram presses the stop button on s ning next track llektrolabs is a fall through a trap door waspish thrum the distorted vocal the hollow space these parts occupy its a misdirection that loads gravitational weight on kern vol 4 s momentum a few minutes later another track dr blowfins effects a more severe downward pressure s gives way to the mixs final track from s grava 4 whose choral chants float over what sounds like churning quicksand these key points ngram isnt so much surging as submerging ngram situates the n mythology in brief an underwater civilisation descended from pregnant african slaves thrown overboard in a ing context that usually demands plateaus and elevations his intimacy with the catalogue stems from a longstanding association with the duo n the early 90s hed mix records with tracks (one of which is on the mix) and miami bass in a detroit motorcycle club called cast before stinsons death in 00 ngram was the groups tour se days the drexiyca material he plays out tends to be aggressive and atonal as opposed to the warm hearted melodies of say andreaen sand dunes kern vol 4 is an insight not only into the steely techno and electro for which ngram is known but also his personal history in detroit but kern vol 4 is notable too for the volume of more recent material run of tracks from s to s were all made in the last three years whose music renders electro in alien sound design and austerely beautiful melody feature on the mix with a brutal 4/4 pump with skittering arps and offbeat bass throbs a scottish classical composer who has recently turned to electronic music makes an unlikely appearance on kern vol 4 through a lonelady remix of though the mixs highlights tend to orbit around stinson and donalds music kern vol 4 s contemporary inclusions pull their weight save for s explosive moments on kern vol 4 are rare transfer of energy from track to track depends on techniques fader slicing short blends platter stops that keep the mix a few degrees below boiling point n transitions like s into s ngram forgoes tension dissolving flashpoints mixs anxious funk isnt only a result of its contents but the way in which such twists contain its energy mixs unusual sequencing is made possible in part by track selections that amplify contrasts (though deeper broken techno cuts by the likes of and give the opening third a satisfying flow ) two tracks by whose versatile techno has surfaced on underground resistance direct beat and twilight 76 supply moments that are variously playful ( ) and severe ( ) vocals and melodies help convey other moods the mix can be arch ( s ) boisterous ( s ) or sinister ( ) kern vol 4 bonds styles of music separated according to ngram by arbitrary categories problem starts with the term electro he told ra seven years ago which in my view is used far too loosely he was making a point about the habit of naming every iteration of a sound but he was also resisting the idea of having his music cast as retro a certain point in their careers some artists find comfort in plumbing the past but by summoning fresh feelings from club music that spans nearly three decades ngram continues to master a sound that seems as futuristic as ever

a luk and lida ps debut as was impressive last years heavy slave positioned them as raw post-punks rubbing against the grain of the vancouver house scenes new age leanings ir murky music hit hard and fast with precocious drum programming and unnerving melodies with practice the duo opened up: aprils split ep on jungle gym records showed a brighter side channelling some of their aggression and darkness into funk and classic house s first vinyl release takes things further for their most confident and engaging work yet title track is the most obvious example of how the duo has mellowed it moves at a steady chug drum fills carefully hitting all the pleasure points woozy melodies coat the background and as always the song slowly builds boosting the rhythm section for the second half and adding some welcome cowbell same goes for : what begins like slowed-down electro bursts to life at the halfway mark with some killer handclaps and a ghostly chord progression other tracks on hew closer to the duos earlier work but with clearer heads and defter touches is chicago house obscured by smog while indulges a darker side with a pseudo-tribal rhythm that feels like a techno edit of joy divisions rocity exhibition for a dance music duo so influenced by post-punk its hard to imagine a better compliment
is the longtime collaboration of ilpo v is nen probably still best known as a member of pan sonic and dirk dresselhaus aka schneider tm together they produce stark electro-acoustic drone-based music terra null which was recorded in 2011 is their latest lp for and it shows the duo joined by two other talented experimental artists: hildur gu nad ttir and lucio capece described as a statement on cultural darwinism and greed its a challenging tightly-controlled listen and one that gets better (and more provocative) as you dig further in the appearances from gu nad ttir and capece are essential to the flow of terra null whose hour-plus runtime is spread over four expansive tracks gu nad ttir a frequent contributor to releases provides cello and vocals on the albums first three tracks capece with his clarinet and saxophone is a relative newcomer to the project but not a stranger to this scene; his many credits include collaborations with mika vainio and vladislav delay he gets to show his mettle on terra null s final two pieces the album begins with the 26-minute epic its first moments are probably the most civilized of the entire lp theres dresselhauss wandering guitar lines which wouldnt be out of place in an old western film and a few pensive plucks of cello strings that linger to provide a bit of rhythm then suffused with v is nen and dresselhauss gloomy machinations the piece moves through masses of guitar noise and effects-laden cello drifting downward before rising up in a state of near bliss then ending in an air of wilted melancholy among the many sustained sounds on are gu nad ttirs clear synchronized vocal intonations a touch of humanity that feels almost celestial in this context with the addition of capece all four artists appear on this one comes laced with descending electronic tones but its leading feature is the combination of reeds and cellos which make the piece sound like its ceaselessly deflating lastly and most aggressively is where capeces instrumentation offers an unsteady focal point for all manner of shrieking rumbling noise given the stated theme of the album its spacious build powerful climax and brittle strung-out ending seem to depict the inevitable and violent collapse of an unsustainable system im partial to the intense catharsis of the last two tracks but anyone with an appetite for confrontational drones should find terra null more than worth their time
kiwi is feists drummer but he also makes some intriguing leftfield records in his own right apparently is about british antarctic explorer ernest shackleton who probably didnt foresee his life being told to a soundtrack of wobbling dubstep basslines pulses of intergalactic melody and boards of canada-style analogue synths the piano dub adopts the minimal approach sliding towards experimental jazz territory with its textured moodscapes east london wunderkind ossie shows an admirable lightness of touch with his reworking of the hyperactive digital steel drums and angular robotic beats veer more towards a twisted urban house sound than the uk funky banner a singularly emotional pared back approach to house music has become midlands mo and doesnt disappoint in that respect underpinned by the percussive slap of a sultry tango tempo it trots rather than gallops shot through with distorted echo and mournful pads
the second release on kenny hanlons records comes from irish producer the aptly-titled thats almost all there is to it initially sounds like some kind of lazy hippie drum circle taking its sweet time to pick up the pace finally three minutes in some whispery synths whoosh their way in like a slightly looser more organic jus-ed track shows a lot of patience in its slow build (what comes later: a two-chord phrase ) liverpudlian producer john is tapped here for his first remix and his reinterpretation gives the kick drum a punishing low-end boost the originals hints of melody are replaced by a full-throated synth that basically blots out the entire frequency spectrum along with the filthy acrid drums we expect from meanwhile msterdam duo juju drench the track in shimmering synth for their spreading the drums out sparsely and laying down a heaving concave bassline to give the twinkling mass a bit of shape
dance music is inherently social; that much goes without saying ut it can also be private whether its the feeling of being lost on the dance floor an emotion steffi for instance channels wonderfully or dreaming of a dance floor that doesnt exist that latter urge is what i hear in these two tracks by (matt gardner) a rooklyn musician who jams econo on synths and drum machines run straight to tape dmittedly its not that hard to imagine these tracks working on the dance floor: both around 116 pm theyre no slower than plenty of contemporary deep house and they tread spongy turf similar to that mapped by move d stl and juju jordash ut working clearly isnt the point these tracks arent slackers but they make no concessions to the usual arbiters the tracks havent been compressed for todays chest-thumping club systems they dont shout at you; they whisper they require you to meet them half way not that theres not funk here especially in with its sprightly bassline and eager handclaps is more sedate although the drum programming and the flickering counterpoints put plenty of shuffle in its sleepwalk ut its a private funk one geared to the after-hours of the mind if that happens to coincide with an actual space filled with other people consider yourself lucky until then you can imagine these songs just running along doing their thing glowing like vacuum tubes in a dark room
since emerging on belgium silverback recordings last year has been making his presence felt with eps for quiet tastemakers man make music formant and take as well as splayed remix work ranging from dfrnt to veteran justin berkovi very much of the ambiguous bass generation the london-based producer paints from a palette of techno dubstep and house which he blends together with emotive subaqueous chords and a signature use of vocals for hypercolour sister dixon presents four variants of hotflush-style house including one of his most catchy tracks to date the ep opens on a familiar george fitzgerald note with melodic luscious keys matched to a chugging bassline and gentle cantering hats but its successor is the standout here taking on more of a swing and song-like quality is dixon at his finest this is an eyes-closed slowed-down sexy slink affair its dubstep made with the ladies in mind and easily one of the most seductive genre-amalgams to rise from the bass pool this year switches up a gear into straighter 4/4 house and yet maintains a kind of glazed casual air that marks the ep on the whole as sedately danceable to be enjoyed at your own leisure this is epitomised by the concluding a serene watercolour awash with dub techno sensibilities

after a decade spent in relative obscurity tommy vicari jnr has emerged as a prolific electronic producer until recently the sheffield-based musician was an enigmatic figure his broad catalogue of house and techno belonged solely to personal friends discogs geeks and the occasional big name dj but since italian label commissioned him for three releases in 2013 vicari jnrs exposure has changed drastically two years later his fifth ep for 320kb might be his most eagerly anticipated has been getting house heads hot under the collar particularly since a video of raresh playing it at sunwaves did the rounds on social media earlier this year its a relatively straightforward day-party banger and an impeccably produced one at that employs similarly warm pads to more introspective ends layering soft drum flicks and spacey effects across its central melody richly textured and slightly wistful its the main reason to pick up vicari jnrs latest sophisticated record
lots of techno artists go anonymous but few do it with as much cheek as the shadowy figures discogs page describes him simply as producer based in russia but his soundcloud puts him on the heard and mcdonald islands a volcanic archipelago halfway between antarctica and madagascar its tempting to think hes actually dutch he djs on intergalactic fm has appeared mostly on dutch labels and his name is (presumably) a reference to when i sold my soul to the machine a documentary about djs in the netherlands in which i-f calls mainstream culture a gesloten cirkel or closed circle his sound too smacks of the hague makes slamming electro-flavored techno thats as playful as it is heavy brutal drums and grim atmospheres are offset by demented melodies campy sci-fi samples or in the case of his self-titled track from 2009 the sound of a rooster crowing his first full-length and his fourth release overall elevates this style to something even more singular like s best past efforts ( yamagic twisted balloon ) is pummeling funky and coated in grease (hard wax called it straight from the sewer ) but here the style is bolder than it was before is built around a soaring heavy metal guitar lead with its disaffected vocals and tinny metronomic drums sounds like an old darkwave 7-inch heard out of context could be mistaken for something from the indie-synth band broadcast and yet despite all this stylistic promiscuity is a storming techno record through and through ferocious rhythms have always been s strong point and here the beats are more threatening than ever thanks mostly to their electro-style syncopation zombie machine and barrel forth with the crazed gallop of a rabid animal and then theres the albums title track and pi ce de r sistance whose first 16 bars alone have some of the most thrilling techno drum patterns ive ever heard vocal samples add streaks of color to these gravelly arrangements on dusty loops from what sounds like a russian pop oldie form an eerie counterpoint to a stomping acid house beat on the words thousand and are repeated ad infinitum in a beautifully cavernous robot voice heaping melody and vivid texture onto an already unstoppable techno bomb is a lot of things fierce catchy brimming with personality but most importantly its just an absurdly badass techno record
ras jack haighton once wrote nothing can be certain except death and taxes and perhaps that snuff crews next record will sound like old school house indeed and what better way to re-create classic house than by employing robert owens one of the genres most famous voices to sing for you the original is made up of surprise roland drums and a warbling 303 which stars both as bassline and lead owens voice complements this mostly-tinted substrate sounding at once both seductive and menacing s only towards the end that a hopeful arp lifts the faint gloom somewhat andreas gehms remix colours things a little darker adding big jellied bass and switching in the angriest of owens vocals even aims to be more authentically vintage using shrill blasts of rave whistle; something seldom heard these days unsurprisingly however its steffis remix which steals the show trimming owens words to mere vocalisations the berlin dj uses them as a melody in their own right cleverly the originals rolling 303 has also been slashed removing its squelchy tail to create a whirring rotor-like noise which spins whimsically up and down throughout
even if you knew zilch about before listening to his fabric mix you could figure a lot out after one spin he enjoys sonorous dopamine releasing chord progressions as well as tough loopy tracks hes well versed in dance music from days gone by with vestiges of 70s new york and 80s chicago popping up periodically he loves 303s pianos and percolating synths and appreciates rhythms that thwack as much as those that flow hes also not afraid of a little darkness though he tends to maintain an optimistic vibe se proclivities have been clear in jansons dj sets for years whats striking is how the running back boss indulges all of them over s 16 tracks and that he does so in a way that makes perfect sense wont get all that from the opening passage though luke s bell filled remix of s s haunting and s melancholy s are all effective even beautiful on their own but theres a flatness to that stretch a subdued moodiness runs through the tracks starting the mix in a somewhat linear fashion fun arrives with s with its classic house bassline and a wailing peech boys style vocal sample from there janson rifles through an array sounds and moods glenn s mix of by blends jazz and joy in equal measure s is a loving piano banging ode to terrence parker s afro latin weds hi hat hiss and conga fury maruader from australian artist blends ebm and warehouse techno once things get moving theres very little repetition in style nervous acid of s segues smoothly into the kraftwerkian synth run of s that songs ecstatic chords glide easily into the tom heavy jack of catz n edit of s that fluidity is at least partially because of jansons way with transitions: he knows when to ride the mix or go for a quick cut but its mostly thanks to his selections that the pivots work he simply knows which tracks will complement each other maybe he could have stepped out of his comfort zone a bit more but is still clear evidence that janson is one of the best house djs out there today
for those in the dark about it would be easy to pass off his first long-player as a clumsy attempt at smooshing world music into a club mould with track names like and an abundance of ethnic-sounding instrumentation its not an unfair assessment problem is mr k is actually from frica which for many could serve as admission of authenticity still shouldnt the music be judged alone without that knowledge from the outset its clear that this isnt just another depeche mode/kraftwerk disciple trying to do things differently thanks to live village recordings things feel too raggedy though one might expect an abundance of drums the focus is squarely melodic with mr k frequently layering multiple instances of the same instrument in frican two kora harps duel furiously for attention initially working in harmony before engulfing one another later on with the bassline barely noticeable it almost sounds akin to strings of fe being covered by the local tribe its not all like this though for example sounds far more synthesised with clubby kicks and delayed xylophone-like percussion woos with sultry electronic pads and a sparse bassline later giving way to dissonant piano hits and subtle fricanesque drums though its just a re-work of an earlier track this may be the better version despite these deviations however mr k never lets us forget which continent is the focus frica leads noisily with barely more than a wailing male chant which is strongly reminiscent of the muslim call to prayer unfolds in a similar fashion though this time the vocals are sweeter and accompanied by a noodling guitar while this will undoubtedly seem fresh to some the best tracks and the aforementioned himayala have been recycled from previous releases and the rest arent always imaginative dditionally though the limber rhythms are refreshing the chaos occasionally gets too much lurching into sloppiness no its not a cheap melding of world music and techno; its more sophisticated than that t any rate were never subjected to anything approaching the crassness of ian olivers bucovina rather as the title suggests the album is an uncomplicated glimpse into the split life of now german-based its just a pity it feels so naive
despite only making his debut last year san franciscos k rock van wey has quickly made his mark on the dub techno scene one reason is the hard work he has put in during release a slew of 12-inches and limited edition tracks on labels like styrax and quietus but arguably the bigger reason is his unique take on the sound while so much dub techno often seems shackled the foundations of sub-aquatic echo and white noise hiss laid down by asic channel van wey steps effortlessly the side and instead floods his tracks with sweeping emotional waves and big partially arrhythmic kick drums that still manage retain a dub aesthetic his latest pair of singles on styrax imprint doesnt break with his distinctive sound but rather crystallises it in pure downbeat bliss lthough difficult choose between the two just edges out its companion release wish i was here with its plaintive emotional call and gentle build starting with several opening bars of moody ambience soon lurches forward with trademark heavy kick drums in an almost four-four beat that seems all the more desperate and searching for its non-repetition wave after wave of forlorn metallic chords then slowly condense sliding glacially in one another with gathering momentum as further bass and drum elements slowly melt in the mix ack is the converse of working more from the rhythm than the ambience it bursts straight in with an even more broken rhythm than the flip side but marked out by a more conventional snare pattern the steely epic chords still thread and push their way through the mix but theres less build here and a rare sense of optimism
who says you can only fetishize analog sounds if s latest on r s is any indication perhaps someday in the future well be nerdily obsessing over retro-digital productions as well fittingly enough aims to wrest an organic thicket of sound out of crispy-clean computerized instruments the result is big room techno over with what sounds like a cover version of a field recording being performed by software synths these artificial nature sounds are largely lurkers underscoring a bright three note motif that leads the way towards a large-scale symphonic breakdown actually the breakdowns a bit of a pile-up in which all manner of wiggling synths come out of the trees to jockey for attention in a lengthy beelike swarm that constitutes a good deal of the tracks girth if ligs original truly becomes a forest only during its dense and whirling climax space dimension controllers remix seems to emerge from directly from out of the sylvan depths his murky tripped-out mixing shimmering like shafts of sunlight through the trees sending the digital forest far far away bound for outer space converting ligs belgian techno into cosmic house it reflects the same deft mix of jazzy rhythms and spacey keys that has made earlier sdc tracks like the love quadrant so unique while they culled from a recognizable deep house palette they were unafraid of going headier more stoned and expansive than has most often been the norm one cant help but wonder whether calling it the mix is a subtle way to rep old-school analog in the face of all this digital splendor ligs take may shine on big club systems but sdcs will be the cut that will come to life on a good home stereo where its drifty inclinations have room to take full flight
in recent months londons nabihah iqbal has executed a neat pincer movement on british electronic music the 19 jewels ep for no pain in pop showed her pop side and now this single for bristols supplies some dance floor heft whats particularly satisfying is that though iqbal is only a handful of releases deep both are immediately identifiable as her work thats mostly down to the synths great silken sheets of sound so glossy-bright they dazzle theres a more direct cross-reference too: the creepy bell-like melody in is almost identical to that in the 19 jewels track pure life but where before it was in service to baleful r b here it floats eerily over a mechanised techno throb its a pairing as old as detroit techno but iqbal pulls it off in her own distinctive style plays things a little wonkier with a grimey asymmetrical groove iqbal has shown she can do blissful contentment but here were given brow-furrowing dissonance still even when things get knotty the mix remains incredibly clean and spacious s calling card in a scene presently obsessed with murk kowton rounds things off with a remix of the a-side his combination of rolling rimshots and a single vocal sample comes out weirdly like elgatos dunkel jam but the framing is different: instead of kowtons usual grime-indebted syncopations we get churning linear techno formally it might not be as striking as his past work but each time the sub-bass grows to a chest-crushing rumble before falling away again youll find that matters less and less
despite sharing the anonymous presentation style as many of technos series labels the releases are inspired by a more broad set of influences indeed while the first few releases were concerned with gritty underground techno the third instalment welcomed jacking chicago rhythms and number five featured a house diva vocal mashed into a sims/user-style dense loop unsurprisingly then the sixth release keeps the listener guessing izarrely it sounds like the unknown artist has sampled jurgen driessens 1993 trance classic epidemic (as exit eee) the epic stuttering chords unfolding over much slower but grittier beats and heavy almost claustrophobic claps it would be unfair to suggest that its a copy-and-paste job though and as a 303 is introduced which brings the track to a spiralling finale the similarities to driessens masterpiece become less pronounced the side is more offbeat; initially a quirky funk bassline is the anchor ingredient in the linear techno groove but gradually other elements are added including a hazy chord sequence some buzzing acid sounds and then the killer blow a heavy resonating break beat that recalls landcruising -era carl craig number six is not the most playable release in the series but if you like techno anonymity served up with a side order of imagination it should fit the bill
is the latest from the erlin-based techno artist otherwise known as luke standing like the majority of his music it arrives on his self-titled label where the producer has steadily been chasing darker and more intense sounds in the last two years these tracks have proved their effectiveness on functions erghain 07 mix and the recent infrastructure facticity compilation now still very much in erghain mode delivers two more staples: punishing techno tools with wildly dense atmospheres oth tracks feature busy-but-rigid percussive layers giving them a locked-in kind of hypnosis is the more severe beginning at full capacity and then rotating through an arsenal of searing hi-hats and rusty heavy-duty drums that push the tension even higher takes a nice step away from standings usual concrete-grey palette the drum sounds have a warm tribal feel to them but the track is still zeroed in on a bruising and repetitive kick y now its clear standing has this kind of banger down to a science
architecture affects us structures set conditions that inform how we see hear and navigate an environment since founding in 2005 paul purgas and james ginzburg have explored the effects of a given space on sound between their first self-titled album and recur released on raster-noton in 2013 the duo honed their singular aesthetic suspended in the ether around post-industrial noise and sound art their focus was not on the body but on the atmosphere around it on their fifth full-length and a first for the label the physical presence of its performers is essential recorded live on homemade instruments swells and lurches in distorted thuds there are 11 tracks but there may as well be one the grinding halting rhythm of the albums wordless mantras shifts through tracks like and rarely deviating from a given frequency after the avant-techno of their self-titled debut album purgas and ginzburg moved on to exploring the limits of their weighty droning sounds their bass-heavy dance music was dismantled then set loose in uncommon settings a disused nuclear power plant in 2011s demiurge an abandoned victorian mansion in medium released the following year although the objective was to add spontaneity to drones and sine waves fed through carefully placed analogue effects processors and filters they could only do so much in uninhabited spaces as a title points to a shift in what the project represents its no longer just a matter of what space does to sound but what space sound and the body do to each other once it pulls you into its core its dissonant sound becomes comforting and then cathartic in evoking confusion as to where man ends and machine begins offers a musical interpretation of a very modern dilemma
a member of australias independent electronic music collective clan analogue bleepin j squawkins comprises of ed leckie and julian higginson and together the pair make electronic disco music as if they were time frozen in the early 80s the duo have a belief and philosophy that 1982 is the future and on thei debut lp they take a trip back to bring their future to the present right from the beginning with rsvp bleeipn j squawkins demonstrate their knack for creating cheesy 80s disco sounds with vocoder vocals (reiterating the song title in full) and drum fills that sound like theyve been in one too many 80s cop shows *cough* miami vice *cough* *cough* minvera moog (part 1) tells a fantasy story on top of german disco influenced electronic beats with the dirty fuzz bassline and vocals courtesy of narrator suzi catchpole alice doesnt know is a deeper and dirtier affair with a druken vocal sample that feels like its been time stretched too far to make any sense out of we are eclectric shifts time signatures to 12/8 swing time and has a deep dubby feel to it yet retaining plenty of bounce in its step dancing on the moon brings back frenetic 80s electro arpeggio synth lines and mixes it up with breaky beats and deep male vocal samples it has a daft punk feel to it as if the daft ones had taken a trip back in time themselves and returned to show us a wicked synth line over and out is the first we get to hear one of the bleepin boys take to the mic and contribute vocals to the album in a melancholy and slightly offtune david byrne kind of way (hey that was fashionable during the 80s ) they sing about broken down relationships and strangely enough drag you down with them finally the close the album off with rock and wobble bringing the album to an uplifting and uptempo tip with sampled computer vocals and cheesy synth lines is an interesting take on 80s electro and disco typically a sound that was famous in the uk and us aussies bleepin j squawkins have taken the theme and made it fun it is a bit of a fad lately to have an 80s influence in your music - artsts like sir drew and chicken lips have proofed the 80s electro equation with their albums but bleepin j have created a fun and accessible album yet falls slightly short of the mark as most of the tunes here come off sounding quite similar to one another
dutch producer and rush hour recordings mainstay had a gaseous summer hit with use me gain a burbling ode to romantic independence filtered through dizzying philly string swoops and a re-purposed shout from millie jacksons we got to hit it off for tragos new single release on rush hour he goes in another direction and offers up two comparatively stark tracks content with functionality booming thunderclouds introduce a collaboration with local dutch producer dj which trundles along pleasantly enough via hiccuping bass its tweaky but exhausts its ideas early with too little breathing room between the desiccated claps and a kick drum tremor to progress this is despite the best efforts of vanilla synth stabs and the silky vocal assurances the two versions of featuring fare better although in this case the pale and pained vocals are a distraction from a stomach-growling bassline in the vocal dub mutters heard in the background never assert themselves and the pr description of the track as a late night basement session is almost a hedge against its own loose production eventually a malfunctioning car alarm morphs into planetary waveforms but things still drag on is the best on offer refining the elements into a single undulating blob and excising the most distracting of s vocal contributions
have been around for 15-odd years but for a growing section of their audience theyre a recent discovery the shift started in 2011 when the japanese trio began to introduce a dance music influence into their noisy kosmische-inspired rock theyve since taken the do lots with little credo to a masochistic extreme focussing on just a handful of long loopy songs recorded on 2013s brilliant n refined through their incendiary live show and re-recorded last year for the japan-only n the risk of such extreme focus is that it turns into obsession and the trio have begun turning to collaborators to keep things fresh last year they worked on a live show and a pair of remixes with shackleton on n/a they team up with another british artist dub innovator adrian sherwood sherwood has a destabilising influence on the bands sound the albums taut hypnotic grooves sing from the same hymn book as n but after a trip through sherwoods mixing desk theyre strafed with erratic delays and layers of additional processing their structures heaving between states sherwoods method is subtractive risky when theres so little to begin with and his interventions dont always match the apocalyptic intensity of on their own opener 1 remains twitchy and tentative for the full ten minutes on the even longer closing track 5 sherwood whips rolling hi-hats into a satisfying fog but holds off from any impactful moments n/a gets bolder in the middle 3 veers into dank techno territory and is crying out for extension the obnoxious ascending tone at the beginning and end could be spun into a druggy epic all of its own 4 disrupts the albums fairly monotone pace setting a speedy kick drum against patient bass tones sherwood is bolder with the fx too his rippling background textures making for the albums most psychedelic moment these short tracks hint at the more compact and engaging album n/a couldve been but on 2 the collaborators show they can also pull off long-form this one has the clearest structure with a motorik groove emerging steadily out of arid gusts of guitar noise at the seven-minute mark the dust clears for a hi-hat entry perhaps the bass throb that follows is sherwoods contribution; it slides uneasily against the pulse causing the drums to shear away again before reforming around it from there sherwoods input gets increasingly wild just as you might have hoped his muffled reverb detonations and sonar-like bleeps give a whole new dimension to s sound
electroclash survivors tiga and zombie nation have outlived the circa-2000 genre epitomised by their biggest hits sunglasses at night and kernkraft 400 they ve both moved in more serious artist directions but this co-production as for turbo shows they still know what moves the world s hippest dancefloors: and right now that s maximal does exactly what it says on the tin essentially an update josh wink s higher for the new rave generation this is 21st century tweakin acid funk not acid as in smiley faces and glow sticks but as in the chemical compound: aggressive corrosive stuff that leaves a sour taste in your mouth its akin to the most ear-splitting moments a digitalism or oys noize track extended over five long minutes would be an effective dj tool for whipping dancefloors into a foaming frenzy if only it weren t so slooow tiga had to crank it up from its original 120bpm to techno tempo to showcase it at this year s sonar festival which should have sent him back to the studio for a rethink and maybe a remix on the flip justice inject some much needed light and dark into the track they chop up the noise throw it over borderline illie jean drums introduce some filters and stop-start dynamics and turn out a cheeky slice dirty funk still it doesn t compare to anything the parisian princes maximal have produced in their own right now that have proved they still have their fingers on the pulse perhaps they can leave the new rave anthems to the kids
for its first release the london label showcased a relatively unknown producer emma whose debut fered an appealing mix classic rephlex-style melodies and contemporary uk funky-influenced drums now turns to aka ed dmx a rephlex veteran (and proprietor his own label breakin records) who has been turning out vintage-inspired electro funk and synth pop since 1994 clarity and sweetness are the main operating principles here across four tracks that variously recall metro area osborne and todd terje is as much song as track with rotating synthesizer leads trading f in a quasi-verse-chorus-verse pattern and a na ve 303 melody somersaulting above s t arpeggios and a gentle robo-disco bassline its a dizzy delightful thing certainly the most outgoing track on the record; as you might guess from the title is darker but almost as catchy and it has an even more expansive sense structure with a bassline reminiscent metro areas miura blossoming into wide-open jazzy space disco and both employ snapping syncopated electro grooves but neither sound quite like classic electro as were used to it even given the distinctly drexciya-like arpeggio that worms its way through theyre s ter milkier more light-hearted thats especially true whose tremolo lead evokes kazoo-grade levels whimsy even as cartoonish bass zaps snap their jaws below
an f-communications favourite returns to the label armed with 2 new reworks of be yourself laurent garnier and broadcast are the remixes but do they live up to expectations the laurent garnier remix is a mist confess very disappointing grungy is probably the best word to describe it and apart from a pretty nice baseline the track really lacks any solid features the beats are muddled but not in a good way and main guitar riffs are quite headache inducing the broadcast remix is not quite that good either the beats are quite intense but have no depth the effects are also quite scattered alongside the vocal that is in french apart from the obvious main line of be yourself the production on the whole though is lacking in any real depth and is quite disappointing i was really trying to find something that i would like with this release but apart from a baseline on the a-side i fell way short disappointing is a word that i easily found however especially from laurent garnier who is capable of much better maybe i missed something here

five years ago simian mobile discos and james ford launched a platform for their forays into house and techno shaws first solo outing on the label is of a piece with smds last ep a collaboration with roman fl gel named after a japanese dish of baby bees like hachinoko some of this swirls with subtle chimes and sweetened computer melodies but it doesnt entirely depart from love of salty flavours for the most part shaw judges this balance nicely bundles a soothing bell loop over a rolling drum track whose elastic rhythm shifts into a different gear every 45 seconds or so shaws 4/4 kick pattern collects shakers toms and hi-hats like an ocean dredger its steers things into choppier waters curling notes are arranged as a sickly arpeggio and rub against wall-banging drums to create a tough and mildly disorienting groove t first it sounds like tracky smd fare but shaws guttural daniel very-esque bass chords burrow deep into the groove giving it a welcome counterweight killing bird searches for a bucolic mood the streaked boards of canada synths almost find it but its static-coated drums poke at shaws relaxing sounds unnecessarily
